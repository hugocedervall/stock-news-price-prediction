2020-12-08 14:04:49,Apple’s last surprise of 2020: Meet AirPods Max,BGR,https://cloud.iexapis.com/v1/news/article/24c20d75-6208-4efb-bb8b-7e064601c9aa,"Apple unveiled the AirPods Max wireless headphones on Tuesday, a highly anticipated new addition to the AirPods family. AirPods Max is available for preorder for $549 and will ship to buyers on December 15th, right in time for Christmas. The wireless headphones pack much of the technology available in other AirPods versions, with a few extra tricks made possible by the over-ear form factor. When Apple “killed” the headphone jack with the iPhone 7, it also unveiled what was to become one of the best and most sought-after Apple products, the AirPods. Since then, Apple released second-generation AirPods with a case that recharges wirelessly, as well as an AirPods Pro model that supports noise cancellation and other new features. But Apple never made over-ear wireless AirPods, which is the kind of product some would prefer over earphones. Instead, all of Apple's over-ear headphones wear Beats branding… until now. Rumors have been swirling for most of 2020 that Apple planned to launch ""AirPods Studio,"" the first wireless over-ear headphones in the AirPods family.",AAPL,https://cloud.iexapis.com/v1/news/image/24c20d75-6208-4efb-bb8b-7e064601c9aa,en,False

Reserve Bank of Australia governor Philip Lowe raised concerns regarding mobile wallet competition. At the 2020 Australian Payments Network summit, Lowe said the current mobile wallet market has given way to complex competitive issues. He specifically brought up Apple Pay's restrictions on the use of its NFC technology—the tech that powers contactless payments in smartphones—which he believes limits the ability of other wallet providers to compete in the same market. Lowe substantiated his concerns by pointing to increased scrutiny from global regulators on the same issue. The Netherlands' Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) is cracking down on mobile wallet competition in the country. The antitrust watchdog recently brought up concerns around consumers' freedom of choice regarding payment apps on smartphones.",AAPL,https://cloud.iexapis.com/v1/news/image/d1290e93-9a35-4ecb-953a-b94bfe245470,en,False
