AirPods Max is available for preorder for $549 and will ship to buyers on December 15th, right in time for Christmas. The wireless headphones pack much of the technology available in other AirPods versions, with a few extra tricks made possible by the over-ear form factor. When Apple “killed” the headphone jack with the iPhone 7, it also unveiled what was to become one of the best and most sought-after Apple products, the AirPods. Since then, Apple released second-generation AirPods with a case that recharges wirelessly, as well as an AirPods Pro model that supports noise cancellation and other new features. But Apple never made over-ear wireless AirPods, which is the kind of product some would prefer over earphones. Instead, all of Apple's over-ear headphones wear Beats branding… until now.

At the 2020 Australian Payments Network summit, Lowe said the current mobile wallet market has given way to complex competitive issues.

Thanks to positive vaccine news, the S&P 500 rose nearly 11% to deliver some of its best gains in the past 30 years while out-of-favor value stocks staged a massive comeback from their underperformance in the last decade or more. Since Pfizer's early November announcement that its vaccine had a 90%+ efficacy rate , Goldman Sachs' long/short value factor, which underperformed for most of the last four years, has surged 12% as of December 3, according to a Monday client note. For investors who have missed the value train, there are still other opportunities that have lagged the market but are well-positioned for the post-pandemic economy. Aside from cyclically oriented value stocks, S&P 500 dividend futures remain an attractive opportunity that trades at significant discounts, Chief US Equity Strategist David Kostin said in the note. While realized S&P 500 dividends per share fell by 5.6% year-over-year in the third quarter, many companies such as Darden Restaurants (DRI), Marathon Oil (MRO), and Estee Lauder (EL) that had suspended dividend payments earlier in the year due to COVID-19 impacts have now resumed, Kostin explained.",AAPL,en,Business Insider
2020-12-08 12:55:20,Apple and Cloudfare Develop New Privacy-Focused Internet Protocol,"Apple and Cloudfare have today announced that they have collaboratively developed a new internet protocol focused on privacy (via TechCrunch ). The protocol, dubbed ""Oblivious DNS-over-HTTPS,"" or ""ODoH,"" makes it more difficult for internet service providers to know which websites users have visited. When visiting a website, browsers use a DNS resolver to convert web addresses into machine-readable IP addresses to locate where the page is located. However, this is an unencrypted process and ISPs can see the DNS query and conclude which websites their users have visited. Internet service providers are also able to sell this information to advertisers. Innovations such as DNS-over-HTTPS, or DoH, have added encryption to DNS queries. While this may dissuade bad actors who may wish to hijack DNS queries to point victims to malicious websites, DNS resolvers are still able to see which websites are being visited. ODoH decouples DNS queries from individual users, so the DNS resolver cannot know which websites have been visited.",AAPL,en,Mac Rumors

Brazilian telecom regulator Anatel approved the three Galaxy S21 handsets ahead of the mid-January launch, revealing several details about them. The documentation says the phones will ship without free chargers and earphones, just like the iPhone 12. The best thing Samsung ever did to conquer the mobile market was to blatantly copy the iPhone . It’s what allowed its Android phones to grow in popularity in the first years when Galaxy S devices looked and felt like iPhone lookalikes. The lawsuits that followed forced Samsung to refine smartphone design and software further and find its own voice. But by the time it happened, Samsung was already at the top of the mobile industry. Even so, Samsung did not take any big risks to push the industry forward. The Galaxy Note is one exception, and the Galaxy Fold another.

Commerce Department officials later said they were taking the unprecedented step of banning the app because of the risks posed by its data collection practices and Chinese ownership. On Monday, however, U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington concluded that President Trump had overstepped his authority in using his emergency economic powers to try to put the wildly popular app out of business.

2020-12-08 06:21:56,India's recovery gained pace in Dec: Nomura,"The pace of India’s recovery accelerated further during the first week of December, reflecting ‘residual’ festive mobility and demand, according to brokerage firm Nomura. The Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI) gathered pace at 89.1 for the week ended December 6, after recording a mild fall in the last week of November, which saw the index being revised down to 88.4 from 89.2, the firm said in a note on Tuesday. Overall, the business activity tracker continued to follow the November trend at 11 percentage points (pp) below pre-pandemic levels, the note said. “This suggests that growth has accelerated further in Q4 (Q3FY21), after a solid sequential normalisation in Q3 (Q2FY21),” said Nomura economists Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi in the note.In its previous note, the Japanese brokerage had said business activity in November showed gains over the previous month with the NIBRI picking up 4.6pp over a 2.1pp improvement in October. The latest uptick came on the back of a recovery in Google’s workplace mobility index even as retail and recreation mobility and Apple’s driving index declined from their previous week’s levels, Nomura said.",AAPL,en,Economic Times India

Apple launched the M1 chip in November, but the company's homegrown processor was only included on a few MacBook models and the latest Mac mini. Apple's successors to the M1 chip could feature up to 32 high-performance processing cores.

In October, the iPhone 12 series made its debut. And in November, we were introduced to the first Mac computers with Apple's own chips.
