In 2008, Barack Obama received the names of his entire future cabinet already one month prior to his election by CFR Senior Fellow (and Citigroup banker) Michael Froman, as a Wikileaks email later revealed. Consequently, the key posts in Obama’s cabinet were filled almost exclusively by CFR members, as was the case in most cabinets since World War II. To be sure, Obama’s 2008 Republican opponent, the late John McCain, was a CFR member, too. Michael Froman later negotiated the TPP and TTIP international trade agreements, before returning to the CFR as a Distinguished Fellow. In 2017, CFR nightmare President Donald Trump immediately canceled these trade agreements – because he viewed them as detrimental to US domestic industry – which allowed China to conclude its own, recently announced RCEP free-trade area , encompassing 14 countries and a third of global trade.","CFR,CIA",en,Zero Hedge

The richest and most powerful country on earth — whether due to ineptitude, choice or some combination of both — has no ability to perform the simple task of counting votes in a minimally efficient or confidence-inspiring manner.

While of course Trump would be far from the only president whose excesses needed checking - any occupant of the most powerful office in world history would - there was at least some reasonable cause to believe that his regular issuances of impulsive, fly-by-tweet demands could eventually raise unique civil liberties concerns. In hindsight, I might as well have been arguing for a parade of pinstriped purple unicorns to march down Fifth Avenue. Because the concept of a rational Trump opposition was an utter fantasy.

It’s called “The Emperor’s New 9/11”. Once upon a time there was an Emperor who loved war and military expansionism. He was always searching for new ways to instigate military conflicts without losing the support of the international community or waking up the populace to the fact that they’re just propagandized cogs in the machine of a globe-spanning Empire which uses endless military and economic violence to maintain its unipolar hegemony. One day two men calling themselves Intelligence Experts came into town claiming that they had devised a wondrous new type of enemy threat that is invisible to the common folk. “Is it as good as 9/11?” asked the Emperor excitedly. “Oh how I loved how that one allowed me to initiate a new era of military expansionism on the pretence of fighting global terrorism!” “It’s even better!” explained the Intelligence Experts. “This magical enemy threat is comprised of Cyber Attacks which are completely invisible to public scrutiny, and you have complete control over where and when they happen.",CIA,en,Zero Hedge

Let’s count the ways. We don’t know a whole lot about how the New York Post story about Hunter Biden got into print. There are some reasons to think the material is genuine (including its cache of graphic photos and some apparent limited confirmation from people on the email chains), but in terms of sourcing, anything is possible. This material could have been hacked by any number of actors, and shopped for millions (as Time has reported ), and all sorts of insidious characters - including notorious Russian partisans like Andrei Derkach - could have been behind it.

Why, if it prosper, none dare call it treason.” – Sir John Harrington. As Shakespeare would state in his play Hamlet , “ Something is rotten in the state of Denmark ,” like a fish that rots from head to tail, so do corrupt government systems rot from top to bottom. This is a reference to the ruling system of Denmark and not just the foul murder that King Claudius has committed against his brother, Hamlet’s father. This is showcased in the play by reference to the economy of Denmark being in a state of shambles and that the Danish people are ready to revolt since they are on the verge of starving. King Claudius has only been king for a couple of months, and thus this state of affairs, though he inflames, did not originate with him. Thus, during our time of great upheaval we should ask ourselves; what constitutes the persisting “ruling system,” of the United States, and where do the injustices in its state of affairs truly originate from?",CIA,en,Zero Hedge

Faddis points out that the rioters have openly stated their goal, the “abolition of the United States as we know it and its replacement with a Marxist state.” The former CIA officer predicts another wave of violence if Trump wins re-election, but also warns that the unrest will continue even if Biden wins because the revolutionaries will seek to take full control of his administration. “That is why it is profoundly delusional to believe the riots of the past three months will end with the November election.",CIA,en,Zero Hedge

President Trump is set to ban TikTok next month. US officials see this as something China is bound to do with their apps, because Edward Snowden’s leaks showed this is exactly what the US did with its many apps and their user data. And yet did it happen? Image: Reuters The latest report out of the CIA says no. While they said it is possible for China to access such user data, because of course it is, they confirmed that there is no evidence that any such things ever happened with TikTok. According to The New York Times on Friday : But when the C.I.A. was asked recently to assess whether it was also a national security problem, the answer that came back was highly equivocal. Yes, the agency’s analysts told the White House, it is possible that the Chinese intelligence authorities could intercept data or use the app to bore into smartphones .",CIA,en,Zero Hedge

But there is no evidence they have done so, despite the calls from President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to neutralize a threat from the app’s presence on millions of American devices.It made little difference. When Trump issued an executive order Thursday that would effectively ban TikTok from operating in the United States in 45 days — part of an effort to force a sale of the app to an American company, most likely Microsoft — he declared it threatened “the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States.”In a surprise addition, he issued a similar ban on WeChat, a Chinese social media app on which millions of people, largely outside the U.S., conduct everyday conversations and financial transactions.There is no doubt the actions by the administration are the toughest since it took steps last year to block the use of Huawei telecommunications equipment by American companies.",CIA,en,Economic Times India

Opinion polls over the last fifty years show that American citizens overwhelmingly (between 80 and 90 percent) believe this false history which, of course, makes them feel better about killing hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians (mostly women and children) and saving American lives to accomplish the ending of the war. The best book, in my opinion, to explode this myth is The Decision to Use the Bomb by Gar Alperovitz, because it not only explains the real reasons the bombs were dropped, but also gives a detailed history of how and why the myth was created that this slaughter of innocent civilians was justified, and therefore morally acceptable.",CIA,en,Zero Hedge

The 86,000 mile, Muslim-majority region sits in the Himalayas on the border with China. It is of strategic significance to both India and Pakistan, primarily because of the Siachen Glacier which brings freshwater the drought-ridden nations. India and Pakistan have nuclear weapons: armaments of such destruction that even a “minor” regional war would cause more than a decade of global nuclear winter.

American troops are entering Baghdad. A tank stops somewhere in the city, cautiously, in the vicinity of a Saddam Hussein monument. After a few minutes of apparent inactivity, a crowd is beginning to form around the monument. The crowd is not all that big. It rallies around the figure of Iraq’s president. Soon an American soldier climbs the monument and puts an American flag on it. An Iraqi intervenes, so the flag is replaced with the Iraqi one. And then, then some individuals begin to climb the statue, a crane arrives from somewhere, a steel rope is attached to the monument and the crane drives slowly back, taunting the line and gradually slanting the president’s image to its feet. Eventually the figure drops to the ground and the cheering people dance around it, deliver it kicks and carry some of the pieces that fell off in the process away. The alien forces have conquered the capital city of the enemy and performed an age-old ritual that victors used to perform in the presence of the vanquished: Americans demolished the material symbol of the enemy’s sovereignty and by doing it they also humiliated the routed nation.",CIA,en,Zero Hedge

Obscured by an extremely bungled White House press response, there are at least three serious flaws with the reporting.

Turkey is the GNA’s only foreign ally. This is bound to once again raise questions about the US position. Nominally the US is backing the GNA, but at times Trump has expressed support for their enemy, the Libyan National Army (LNA). The deescalation would be seen as bailing out the LNA from recent losses. Image: AFP “President Trump reiterated concern over worsening foreign interference in Libya and the need for rapid de-escalation ,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement .

CrowdStrike’s president Shawn Henry testified, “There’s not evidence that [documents and emails] were actually exfiltrated [from the DNC servers]. There’s circumstantial evidence but no evidence that they were actually exfiltrated.” This was a crucial revelation because the thousand ships of Russiagate launched upon the positive assertion that CrowdStrike had definitely proven a Russian hack. This sworn admission has been hidden from the public for over two years, and subsequent commentary has focused on that singular outrage.

U.S. interventionists should have also used the day to apologize not only to the families of those veterans but also to the families who lost loved ones as a consequence of U.S. interventionism in their countries. Let’s begin with the obvious. Ever since interventionists turned America toward empire and foreign control and domination in the Spanish American War in 1898, there has been no nation-state that has invaded the United States. There is a simple reason for that: No nation-state in Europe, Africa, and Asia has the money, armaments, personnel, equipment, supplies, or even the interest in crossing the ocean and invading the United States.

But saying that doesn’t imply he either should be fighting this war or is capable of winning the real war. What is that real war? Retaining U.S. dominance over the flow of international capital for the next four generations. Because that is what is at stake. Trump’s slash and burn policies towards China have always been fraught with inconsistencies. From “trade wars are easy to win” (a lie) to the current over-reaction to COVID-19 (“the China Flu”) Trump is conflating the two main wars he is fighting into one. Ending the Institutional Rot The first main war he is fighting is against the globalists I call The Davos Crowd . His fundamental distrust of the post-WWII institutional architecture is at the forefront of why he deals with Europe the way he does. Trump understands that The Davos Crowd’s goal is the cultural and economic destruction of the U.S. by creating a transnational superstate that exists as a regulatory and monetary framework built on top of the European Union.",CIA,en,Zero Hedge

Trump's attacks came after Obama criticized the Justice Department's decision last week to drop its charges against Flynn, who had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his communications with Russia before Trump became president.

As the journalist Fintan O’Toole noted recently in the Irish Times: “Over more than two centuries, the United States has stirred a very wide range of feelings in the rest of the world: love and hatred, fear and hope, envy and contempt, awe and anger. But there is one emotion that has never been directed towards the U.S. until now: pity.” Quite right. But how and why did this pitiable condition come about? Is it all Donald Trump’s fault as so many now assume? Or did the process begin earlier? The answer for any serious student of imperial politics is the latter.

The officials told the judge in the civil case that the release of the files would endanger national security.

They would have been better off with another scion of Hollywood: the Phantom of the Opera. This grubby seditionist has marched the party into a wilderness of deceit and knavery that taints them all, and when this grotesque impeachment episode is over, a new chapter of consequences will open that should leave the party for dead. It’s hard to think of a more loathsome figure in US political history than Adam Schiff. General James Wilkinson? Senator Theodore Bilbo? Benjamin “Pitchfork” Tillman? Joseph McCarthy? Hillary Clinton? And that doesn’t count the mere rogues and rascals like Huey Long, Boss Tweed, and George Wallace. A universe of chaos lurks behind Mr. Schiff’s slick Tinseltown façade. The impeachment he led was crippled from the start with violations of process and errors of logic of exactly the kind that drives his party’s Woke hysteria with its assaults on free speech, its vicious “cancel” culture, its reckless race-hatred, its depraved Transsexual Reading Hours, and its neurotic obsession with Russian phantoms — a matrix of beliefs that would embarrass a conclave of medieval necromancers.",CIA,en,Zero Hedge

After Ben Affleck's best director snub, Oscar voters rallied around him and gave him best picture to make up for it. ""Django Unchained,"" ""Life of Pi,"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty"" all could have won that year — far better films with more singular styles. 9. 'The Hurt Locker' (2010) IMDB synopsis: ""During the Iraq War, a sergeant recently assigned to an army bomb squad is put at odds with his squad mates due to his maverick way of handling his work.""

That relationship became collateral damage to gross corruption in Ukraine. The U.S. and its allies, especially the UK under globalists like David Cameron, wanted to peel off Ukraine from the Russian orbit and make it part of the EU and eventually NATO. From Russia’s perspective, this was unacceptable. It may be true that most Americans cannot find Ukraine on a map, but a simple glance at a map reveals that much of Ukraine lies East of Moscow. Putting Ukraine in a Western alliance such as NATO would create a crescent stretching from Luhansk in the South through Poland in the West and back around to Estonia in the North.

Hudson writes: The assassination was intended to escalate America’s presence in Iraq to keep control of the region’s oil reserves, and to back Saudi Arabia’s Wahabi troops (Isis, Al Quaeda in Iraq, Al Nusra and other divisions of what are actually America’s foreign legion) to support U.S. control of Near Eastern oil as a buttress of the U.S. dollar. That remains the key to understanding this policy, and why it is in the process of escalating, not dying down.

But an emerging reporting consensus does indicate that the public justification for the strike — that Soleimani posed an ""imminent"" threat as he was orchestrating an attack against American troops and sites in the region — was manufactured based on flimsy intelligence. The evolving and contradictory statements within the administration itself demonstrates at least this much. And now according to the latest NBC bombshell it's becoming clear that the top IRGC general's killing was actually months in the works : President Donald Trump authorized the killing of Iranian Gen.

The illegal assassinations prompted an Iranian missile strike on two US bases in Iraq, and bringing Washington and Tehran dangerously close to a larger military confrontation, until Trump stood down in the face of reprisals by Iran and its allies in the region.

Wednesday night, Speaker Nancy Pelosi delivered the goods. The House impeached President Donald Trump on a straight party-line vote. Not one Republican signed on to the most partisan impeachment in U.S. history. Yet, as we head for trial in the Senate, Democrats seem to be having nervous second thoughts over what they have done. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for the Senate to subpoena four new witnesses the House never heard. Nancy Pelosi signaled Wednesday night that she might not send over to the Senate the articles of impeachment the House had just approved. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took to the floor both Wednesday night and Thursday morning. To have the Senate, which is judge and jury of the impeachment charges, to start calling witnesses whom House prosecutors failed to pursue “could set a nightmarish precedent.” Said McConnell, Schumer “would apparently like our chamber to do House Democrats’ homework for them.” Schumer’s plea for new witnesses is an admission that the House’s case for impeaching Trump is inadequate and deficient and could prove wholly noncredible to the American people.",CIA,en,Zero Hedge

President Richard Nixon — who famously quipped after leaving office that “when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal” — used the FBI and the CIA to spy on his political opponents. The stated reason was national security. Nixon claimed that foreign agents physically present in the U.S. agitated and aggravated his political opponents to produce the great public unrest in America in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and thus diminished Americans’ appetite for fighting the Vietnam War. There was, of course, no evidence to support that view, but the neocons in Congress and the military-industrial complex supported it even after Nixon left office.

Though international reports and human rights monitoring groups have consistently cited a little over 200 killed (with the UN and Amnesty saying 208 or more), US figures are multiple times higher.

Before breaking under the pressure to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act on November 27, Trump attempted desperately to push against the hard liners stating a day earlier : “I stand with Hong Kong, but I also stand with President Xi. He’s a friend of mine, he’s an incredible guy. We have to stand, but I’d like to see them work it out, OK? We have to see them work it out.

It had evolved from Jefferson’s 1800 bloc of yeoman farmers to Andrew Jackson’s rowdy caucus of frontier populists in the 1830s, and settled into a slough of pro-slavery apologists by the 1850s, including two do-nothing Democratic presidents, Pierce and Buchanan. The party held a nominating convention in the spring of 1860 and couldn’t come up with a candidate when a claque of southern “fire-eaters” walked out. They tried again a few months later and cracked up into three separate parties with three nominees — and of course Mr. Lincoln won the election. The result was the bloodiest war in US history. That’s one way to drain a swamp.

Recorded in a secret location and released at the end of April, the video showed the jihadi leader calmly reflecting on the loss of Islamic State’s last swath of Middle Eastern territory in March, largely to a coalition of U.S. and Kurdish forces. He spoke about the Easter Sunday bombings in Sri Lanka that killed more than 250 people, which were claimed by the Sunni group, and said Islamic State would now take its battle across the world. Shortly before, Islamic State had claimed its first attack in Congo, where three soldiers were shot dead by what the group said was a new Central African wilayat, or province. He also praised Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS), which operates in the part of the Sahel region that overlaps Mali and Niger. Africa, he said, would be a land of rebirth. “The loss of the core, the caliphate, was a huge blow to them,” says Thomas Abi-Hanna, a security analyst with Stratfor. “They are really trying to play up the gains they’ve made elsewhere, and Africa’s arguably the place where they’ve made the most gains.” “Having provinces around the globe—whether in Africa or elsewhere—achieves their broader goal” The continent is fertile ground.",CIA,en,Bloomberg

Mueller could be called to testify before Congress, but a 1999 law will likely limit what he can say. An experienced attorney, he could return to private practice or retire altogether. The post-investigation lives of other independent and special counsels offer hints at what his impending choice. On Friday evening, Special Counsel Robert Mueller accompanied his wife , Ann Standish, for dinner at one of their favorite D.C. restaurants, Salt & Pepper. The unassuming venue, where the couple usually order grilled sea scallops and Caesar salad , belied the gravity of what was happening in the capital. Hours earlier, Mueller had turned in his much-anticipated report on Russian interference in the 2016 election and the Trump campaign's alleged involvement in it. As they ate, Attorney General William Barr was already at work on his equally anticipated response. Barr's his four-page summary, delivered to Congress on Sunday , reported that one of the most significant questions Mueller sought to answer — whether or not the President obstructed justice — remained unanswered.

I believe this notion to be propped up by a series of misconceptions that stand in dire need of correction. 1. NATO is not a war-legalizing body, quite the opposite. NATO, like the United Nations, is an international institution that has something or other to do with war, but transferring the UN’s claimed authority to legalize a war to NATO has no support whatsoever in reality.

According to CNN , Hundreds of Transportation Security Administration officers, who are required to work without paychecks through the partial government shutdown, have called out from work this week from at least four major airports… TSA spokespeople, meanwhile, insist everything is completely normal although absenteeism has ""increased by 200% to 300%,"" according to Marketwatch . Not everyone was as sanguine about the situation as government officials. One frequent traveler complained “The lines were exceptionally longer than normal, especially for a peak departure time frame of 8 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.” Given that the feds admit more employees are skipping work, it's hard to believe that everything's humming along normally - unless workers are lowering security standards to get more people through the line quickly.",CIA,en,Zero Hedge
2019-01-11 22:25:00-05:00,"As Democratic Elites Reunite With Neocons, The Party's Voters Are Becoming Far More Militaristic And Pro-War Than Republicans","Via Glenn Greenwald of The Intercept PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP’S December 18 announcement that he intends to withdraw all U.S. troops from Syria produced some isolated support in the anti-war wings of both parties , but largely provoked bipartisan outrage among in Washington’s reflexively pro-war establishment. Both GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham , one of the country’s most reliable war supporters, and Hillary Clinton , who repeatedly criticized former President Barack Obama for insufficient hawkishness, condemned Trump’s decision in very similar terms, invoking standard war on terror jargon. But while official Washington united in opposition, new polling data from Morning Consult/Politico shows that a large plurality of Americans support Trump’s Syria withdrawal announcement: 49 percent support to 33 percent opposition. That’s not surprising given that Americans by a similarly large plurality agree with the proposition that “the U.S. has been engaged in too many military conflicts in places such as Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan for too long and should prioritize getting Americans out of harm’s way” far more than they agree with the pro-war view that “the U.S. needs to keep troops in places such as Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan to help support our allies fight terrorism and maintain our foreign policy interests in the region.” But what is remarkable about the new polling data on Syria is that the vast bulk of support for keeping troops there comes from Democratic Party voters, while Republicans and independents overwhelming favor their removal.",CIA,en,Zero Hedge
2019-01-11 21:45:00-05:00,The Age Of Trump Clearly Shows That Narrative Is Everything,"Authored by Caitlin Johnstone via Medium.com, Earlier this week, President Donald Trump tweeted the following: “Endless Wars, especially those which are fought out of judgement mistakes that were made many years ago, & those where we are getting little financial or military help from the rich countries that so greatly benefit from what we are doing, will eventually come to a glorious end!” The tweet was warmly received and celebrated by Trump’s supporters, despite the fact that it says essentially nothing since “eventually” could mean anything. Indeed, it’s looking increasingly possible that nothing will come of the president’s stated agenda to withdraw troops from Syria other than a bunch of words which allow his anti-interventionist base to feel nice feelings inside. Yet everyone laps it up, on both ends of the political aisle, just like they always do: Trump supporters are acting like he’s a swamp-draining, war-ending peacenik… ...his enemies are acting like he’s feeding a bunch of Kurds on conveyor belts into Turkish meat grinders to be made into sausages for Vladimir Putin’s breakfast, when in reality nothing has changed and may not change at all.",CIA,en,Zero Hedge

""It's as if the US Embassy is there not only to protect American interests, but to manage the entire world from the heart of the capital, Baghdad.” — Iraqi Sheikh Qassim Al Ta’ee, as quoted on 27 December 2011 in Al Iraq News and translated by Ibrahim Zaidan from the original Arabic by Nicholas Dagher Zaidan’s article went on to say: The world's largest embassy is situated in the Green Zone and fortified by three walls, another barrier of concrete slabs, followed by barbed wire fences and a wall of sandbags. It covers an area of 104 acres, six times larger than UN headquarters in New York and ten times larger than the new embassy Washington is building in Beijing – which is just 10 acres. [Editor's' Note: The ten-acre US Embassy in Beijing is the second largest overseas construction project in the history of the Department of State — and the 104-acre US Embassy in Iraq is the largest.] So, America's largest diplomatic mission is surrounded by high concrete walls, is painted in black, brown and grey and is completely isolated from its environment…",CIA,en,Zero Hedge
2019-01-10 10:45:00-05:00,House Democrats To Grill Mnuchin Over Russian Oligarch Who Was FBI Asset,"House Democrats have called on Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to deliver a classified briefing Thursday regarding the Trump administration's plans to end sanctions affecting several companies tied to Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, according to the New York Times . In April, the Trump administration hit three companies Deripaska controls with sanctions over Russian interference in the 2016 US elections; EN+, Rusal and JSC EuroSibEnergo. Following the announcement, the Treasury Department delayed their implementation - eventually deciding in December that they would be lifted following an aggressive lobbying campaign by Deripaska's network. Democratic lawmakers sent Mr. Mnuchin a letter on Tuesday seeking an explanation for why the termination of the sanctions was justified. They expressed concern that Mr. Deripaska still maintained “significant ownership” of En+, the holding company that controls Rusal, while transferring shares to VTB, a sanctioned Russian bank. They also said that the government shutdown was hampering their ability to properly review the decision.",CIA,en,Zero Hedge
2019-01-09 23:55:00-05:00,Paul Craig Roberts: Majority Of Americans Do Not Believe The Official 9/11 Story,"Authored by Paul Craig Roberts, TruePublica , a British website that has avoided the 9/11 issue, has had its fill of ignorant journalists at the BBC, Huffington Post and other propagandists for the military/security complex. The constant, shrill demeaning of experts and distinguished people who have raised questions about the official story has convinced TruePublica that skeptics who need so much shouting down must have a point. The media has NEVER EXAMINED the evidence or explained the analysis provided by scientists, architects, engineers, pilots, and the first responders who experienced the explosions of the World Trade Center twin towers. The media has never asked for the release of the multiple videos that recorded whatever struck the Pentagon. The media has never investigated whether cell phones worked in 2001 from the altitudes at which the official story claims calls were made. Instead two-bit punk presstitutes, such as the BBC’s Chris Bell and the Huffington Post’s Jess Brammer andl Chris York, label experts with knowledge and integrity “conspiracy theorists.” These presstitutes knowingly use a cover-up term that the CIA put into use via its media assets to discredit the expert skeptics of the Warren Commission Report on the assassination of President Kennedy.",CIA,en,Zero Hedge
2019-01-09 14:56:07-05:00,Iran Says It Is Holding A US Navy Veteran In Prison,"Iran said on Wednesday it had arrested, and was holding U.S. Navy veteran Michael R. White, 46, of California at a prison in the country, making him the first American known to be detained under President Donald Trump's administration according to AP. While relations between the US and Iran had entered a holding pattern in recent months as Trump shifted his attention to the border wall situation, White's detention adds new pressure to the rising tension between Iran and the U.S., which under Trump has escalated, culminating with the US pulling out of Obama's nuclear deal with world powers. While the circumstances of White's detention remain unclear, Iran has in the past used its detention of Westerners and dual nationals as leverage in negotiations. The semi-official Tasnim news agency, close to the country's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, reported the confirmation citing Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi. ""An American citizen was arrested in the city of Mashhad some time ago and his case was conveyed to the U.S administration on the first days"" of his incarceration, Ghasemi was quoted as saying.",CIA,en,Zero Hedge
