Powis betonte, bei der Warnung handele es sich um eine reine Vorsichtsmaßnahme, wie es bei neuen Impfstoffen üblich sei. Entwickelt haben das Mittel das Mainzer Pharma-Unternehmen Biontech und sein US-Partner Pfizer. Die zuständige Aufsichtsbehörde teilte mit, dass die Warnung für Menschen gelte, die in der Vergangenheit «signifikante» allergische Reaktionen - sogenannte anaphylaktische Schocks - auf Medikamente, Lebensmittel oder Impfstoffe gezeigt hätten. Gemeint sind zudem Menschen, die eine Adrenalin-Fertigspritze - einen Autoinjektor - bei sich tragen müssen - wie die beiden betroffenen NHS-Mitarbeiter.

Investors added a net GBP2.3 billion to equity funds, the second highest month of inflows on record after April 2020, when economic and financial support packages from governments and central banks helped spur a resurgence in global markets. In November, active funds enjoyed their best month in five years, with record GBP1.5 billion inflows to active global funds and GBP820 million inflows into ESG equity funds. ESG equity funds garnered higher inflows over the month than the total amount raised during the five years to January 2020. Edward Glyn, Calastone’s head of global markets, comments: “The long-awaited vaccine news could scarcely have been any better.” “Record fund turnover, record inflows for some of the biggest equity fund categories, and near-record inflows for equity funds overall, add up to a huge sigh of relief that the end may finally be in sight for the pandemic and its devastation of the global economy.” Daily trading data shows that vaccine news was the turning point in markets.",AZN,en,InstitutionAlassetManager

Just 14% of the world's population has bought 53% of the most promising vaccines, with Canada singled out as having enough doses to vaccinate every Canadian five times.

The leading vaccine-makers are now aiming to produce hundreds of millions of doses of their shots. The global demand for a COVID-19 vaccine is likely to vastly outstrip supply, turning more attention to the ability of companies to pump out doses. The manufacturing challenge may be most dramatic for Moderna, a biotech upstart that has never before produced or sold a commercial medicine. Its flagship manufacturing facility in Norwood, Massachusetts, has never been inspected by the US Food and Drug Administration, yet will be depended upon to deliver millions of doses of the company's coronavirus vaccine candidate. Adding to the challenge, the leading vaccines from both Moderna and Pfizer are based on a new technology called messenger RNA, which has never before been used for a federally approved vaccine or treatment. ""I think the biggest risk is this is new commercial technology,"" Ian Leavesley, an expert in pharmaceutical manufacturing processes, told Business Insider in an email.

COVID-19 survivors mount an immune response that’s detectable in the blood some eight months after infection. Scientists have analyzed B cells in samples from COVID-19 survivors, which are white blood cells that remember previous infections and can spawn additional neutralizing antibodies when reinfection occurs. AstraZeneca and Oxford announced interim data for their coronavirus vaccine candidate on Monday, making it the third vaccine out of three that were proven effective in Phase 3 trials. The Oxford vaccine might not have an efficacy rating as high as Pfizer or Moderna, but the drug has a few advantages. Not only is it cheaper to produce, but it can also be stored and transported at higher temperatures, making it ideal for use in places that lack the logistics needed for the other two drugs.

Por el momento, la candidata de Janssen es la única que se administraría en una sola dosis. De esas 800 millones de inmunizaciones, a España le correspondería el 10 por ciento: 80 millones.

AstraZeneca’s reward for unveiling promising data for its “vaccine for the world”, developed in partnership with Oxford University, was a 3.8% fall in its share price. No gratitude there – just a decline of roughly £4bn in the company’s value. Investors have to react somehow, but the strong response looks odd. AstraZeneca, remember, has pledged to distribute the vaccine at cost during the course of pandemic. For the purposes of that pledge, it’s a little vague who decides when the pandemic is over. But it has always been reasonably clear that AstraZeneca won’t make profits from the initial orders that have been received from governments and international bodies. So the day when the company can move to a for-profit model (with supplies to poorer nations remaining at cost) is still some way off. Continue reading…",AZN,en,The Guardian

In September, hedge funds made GBP543 million betting against the London benchmark. In what proved to be a “bumper” month for bearish managers, bets against Rolls Royce were the most profitable short for the second consecutive month - netting hedge funds GBP238 million in October, after September’s GBP244 million win.

The drug is called AT-527 and it’s currently in Phase 2 testing, with the final stage of clinical trials set for the first half of 2021. This new medicine is supposed to block the replication of the coronavirus inside the cell and prevent its ability to spread in the human body. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) formally approved Gilead Sciences’ Veklury (remdesivir) as the first treatment for COVID-19 on Thursday. The drug proved in clinical trials that it could help patients recover faster than traditional care. But remdesivir will not prevent deaths, a massive study from the World Health Organization (WHO) showed. The FDA’s approval followed the emergency use authorization that remdesivir received in May. But the FDA makes it clear this is the kind of COVID-19 therapy that “should only be administered in a hospital or in a healthcare setting capable of providing acute care comparable to inpatient hospital care.” The drug is administered intravenously, and it’s not the kind of therapy that can be used in a home setting.",AZN,en,BGR

It's far from certain that any vaccine will have results so early. The studies depend on enough volunteers falling sick, so a board of independent experts can see if a group getting the experimental shots is getting less sick than people receiving a placebo.

It was seen as a political gesture by President Vladimir Putin to assert victory in the global race for a vaccine.It is not clear whether the slow start to the vaccination campaign is a result of limited production capacity or second thoughts about inoculating the population with an unproven product.The Russian vaccine is one of nine candidates around the world now in the late-stage clinical trials that are the only sure means to determine whether a vaccine is effective and find possible side effects.A vaccine is considered the only way to halt the spread of the coronavirus, which has sickened more than 30 million people globally and slowed economies around the world since it first appeared in China late last year.In one example of the limited scope of distribution, the company financing the vaccine pointed to a shipment sent this past week to the Crimean Peninsula.",AZN,en,Economic Times India

Japan's constitution forbids the type of lockdowns seen in Europe, China and the US. The state of emergency adopted by the government wasn't nearly as robust a measure as what other countries tried. And yet, Japan has a relatively low rate of infection. None of this really makes sense, considering that Japan's aged population consumes more adult diapers per year than infant diapers. Still, in an effort to quell fears, the Japanese government is reportedly planning to offer a COVID-19 vaccine free of charge to any citizen who wants one, according to a report from Nikkei.

Approval for human use is expected to be within 3 to 7 days after registration by regulators. Back story: Two weeks ago, Nairametrics had reported that the head of the Russian wealth fund (RDIF) hinted that Russia could make available a vaccine for the treatment of Coronavirus as early as September. He said that a deal had been agreed with AstraZeneca to manufacture a COVID-19 vaccine being developed by the pharmaceutical giant and Oxford University.

Researchers are targeting efficacy of at least 60% for the drugs, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, which is the standard for vaccines. The Operation Warp Speed leader thinks COVID-19 vaccine efficacy will end up being much higher than that — potentially higher than 90% — which is the most optimistic prediction so far. At least three vaccine efforts have reached Phase 3 clinical trials in America and Europe, which is the last stage of human testing for new drugs. If successful, the vaccine candidates from Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, and AstraZeneca/Oxford could receive emergency use authorization this year, as early as October and November . This would allow officials in charge of local COVID-19 management policies to initiate immunization protocols, with high-risk people likely to be the first to receive vaccines. Healthcare workers and other frontline personnel who can be exposed to the virus, as well as older people who are likely to develop complications after infection, could be among the first to be inoculated with the final versions of vaccines.",AZN,en,BGR

The death rate from COVID-19 has been on the rise in the US once again for nearly a month following a steady decline after the initial spike in April. Gates also notes that we won't be able to get back to normal until a vaccine is ready. As bad as the second spike of the coronavirus pandemic has been in the United States, the silver lining was that the death rate had continued to drop even as our daily confirmed case count skyrocketed. Unfortunately, that trend ended in July, as the death toll began slowly creeping back up, and as of July 27th, the US was averaging over 1,000 deaths a day. This is the first time the seven-day average has been over 1,000 deaths since late May, but as awful as the US response to the pandemic has been, Bill Gates believes we will soon be able to control the death rate. In an interview with CNBC's Squawk Box this Monday , billionaire philanthropist and Microsoft's co-founder Bill Gates said that we will have therapeutic drugs to more effectively treat COVID-19 before the end of the year, but added that we won't be able to return to our normal lives until a safe and effective vaccine is readily available. “You can see the therapeutic benefit faster than the protective benefit,” Gates said. “So I think there’s a good chance we’ll have substantial death-rate reduction by the end of the year with the combination of those new tools.” During the interview, Gates mentioned remdesivir , which was one of the first treatments to show efficacy among those who had been infected with the novel coronavirus.",AZN,en,BGR

But Dr. Anthony Fauci explained in an interview that the vaccines won’t be widely available to the public until sometime in 2021, even if they're approved this year. Vaccines that can block the novel coronavirus from infecting cells are our best hope to return to a sense of normalcy. And several vaccine candidates have already shown promising results. They can block the novel coronavirus with minimal side effects . But the critical Phase 3 trials haven't yet begun for several of these experimental compounds since tens of thousands of volunteers from around the world need to be enrolled in the trials.

It's possible to get other coronaviruses more than once . This has implications for a COVID-19 vaccine. According to experts, it's likely people will need to be regularly revaccinated. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . We're all holding our breath for a coronavirus vaccine — for the day everyone can line up, get a shot, and then finally return to life as normal. But there are many problems with that vision, a primary one being: We're all going to need more than one shot. Research is coalescing around the idea that coronavirus antibodies dissipate after a period of weeks or months. Although our immune systems have more than just that one line of defense, those findings suggest that our immunity to the virus — whether generated in response to an infection or as the result of a vaccine — might be similarly transient. Because the efficacy of a vaccine hinges on its ability to prompt the body to generate antibodies that protect you from future infection, it's likely that people will need two doses of a coronavirus vaccine a few weeks apart for it to be effective.",AZN,en,Business Insider

Recent research showed that COVID-19 antibodies might not be detectable in the bloodstream within three months of beating the disease. However, patients would still carry T cells that will reproduce the required antibodies upon reinfection. Research for a vaccine that can prevent novel coronavirus infections is advancing at a rapid pace, as well-over 100 such projects are underway. That’s not a guarantee that the vaccines will actually be effective, or that any of them will be ready for use this year.

(NASDAQ: GILD ). The report polarized investors and the sell-side alike as they debated the pros and cons of a potential combination. A report in The London Times suggested a union is unlikely, as AstraZeneca is focused on its promising oncology pipeline and its recent coronavirus vaccine program. An M&A deal at this juncture and at such a scale would serve a distraction from these focus areas, the report said. Investors Skeptical Of Deal: The odds of AstraZeneca buying Gilead over the next 12 months is about 33%, Mizuho Securities analyst Salim Syed said, citing a survey of investors that are predominantly hedge funds. When asked about the maximum price AstraZeneca could pay for Gilead, respondents on average suggested a $102-per-share price could be in offing. An average of $98 was what investors said is the minimum price per share Gilead should accept from AstraZeneca.",AZN,en,Benzinga

More significantly, the group is in the vanguard of Covid-fighting efforts by helping Oxford University develop a coronavirus vaccine and then, we hope, produce a successful product in massive volumes. Now, though, comes something different: a Bloomberg report of an approach last month to Gilead of the US to create a new pharma giant. Nobody expects a deal to happen, it should be said.

The five companies mentioned are Moderna, AstraZeneca, J&J, Merck, and Pfizer. The decision will reportedly be made over the next few weeks. The Trump administration has selected five companies as the most likely candidates to produce a vaccine for the coronavirus, senior officials said, a critical step in the White House’s effort to deliver on its promise of being able to start widespread inoculation of Americans by the end of the year. By winnowing the field in a matter of weeks from a pool of around a dozen companies, the federal government is betting that it can identify the most promising vaccine projects at an early stage, speed along the process of determining which will work and ensure that the winner or winners can be quickly manufactured in huge quantities and distributed across the country.",AZN,en,Zero Hedge

The expert said that the drugs that are in development might only provide up to 12 months of protection, as coronavirus immunity doesn't appear to last longer for the novel coronavirus than it does for other known human viruses. Fauci said in previous vaccine remarks that he’s cautiously optimistic about the vaccines that are in human testing right now, and he maintains that line of thinking. If effective, hundreds of millions of doses of the drugs could be available by early 2021. The more we learn about the novel coronavirus, the clearer it is that COVID-19 isn’t going away anytime soon — if at all. But these past few weeks taught us that there’s a lot of hope for living with this new pathogen, just like we do with the flu.

Kirkpatrick and Jane BradleyLONDON: The two Chinese companies were offering a risky proposition: 2 million home test kits said to detect antibodies for the coronavirus for at least $20 million, take it or leave it. The asking price was high, the technology was unproven, and the money had to be paid upfront. And the buyer would be required to pick up the crate loads of test kits from a facility in China.Yet British officials took the deal, according to a senior civil servant involved, then confidently promised tests would be available at pharmacies in as little as two weeks. “As simple as a pregnancy test,” gushed Prime Minister Boris Johnson. “It has the potential to be a total game changer.” There was one problem, however. The tests did not work.Found to be insufficiently accurate by a laboratory at Oxford University, half a million of the tests are now gathering dust in storage. Another 1.5 million bought at a similar price from other sources have also gone unused. The fiasco has left embarrassed British officials scrambling to get back at least some of the money.“They might perhaps have slightly jumped the gun,” said professor Peter Openshaw of Imperial College London, a member of the government’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group. “There is a huge pressure on politicians to come out and say things that are positive.”A spokesperson from the Department of Health and Social Care said the government ordered the smallest number of tests allowed by the sellers and that it would try to recover the money, without specifying how.The ill-starred purchases are in some ways a parable of the risks in the escalating scrum among competing governments racing for an edge in the fight against the pandemic.The still-emerging tests for antibodies formed in response to the virus are the next stage in the battle.",AZN,en,Economic Times India

Natco named its brand Dapnat, which will be available in 5mg and 10mg strengths. These products will be priced significantly lower than the two strengths of Farxiga (dapagliflozin) sold in India. While Natco has priced its two products at INR15 and INR19.50 respectively, AstraZeneca's Farxiga costs INR49 and INR57 for each tablet. The launch gives Natco an entry in the rapidly growing SGLT-2 segment that has mostly been dominated by global drug makers. However, for roughly a year, the segment has seen the entry of Indian drug maker Glenmark, which launched its versions of remogliflozin at a significantly lower price than MNC brands. According to information available, AstraZeneca has two patents on dapagliflozin in India, the first of which expires later this year in October and the other in 2023.
