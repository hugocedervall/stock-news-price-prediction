2019-01-03 10:35:32-05:00,Morgan Stanley Predicts First Global Auto Sales Volume Drop Since 2009,"Morgan Stanley's auto analyst Adam Jonas - formerly one of the biggest Tesla cheerleaders - predicts that global auto sales will be down 0.3% year over year in 2019 and that many consensus estimates across the industry are far too optimistic. In a note released Thursday morning, Jonas predicts ""lower guidance"" coming out of Detroit automakers at the same time that the global auto market sees its first volume drop since 2009. And despite consensus forecasts predicting revenue and margin growth across the board, Morgan Stanley generally defied the trend, reiterating its cautious view on the US auto sector. Jonas expects global volume in 2019 to fall to 82.1 million units versus 82.4 million units in 2018 . His team also expects higher input costs, combined with rising rates and rising R&D expense, to further pressure 2019 numbers. Aside from the obvious (lack of volume growth), he predicts tariff related costs will still be an overhang for automakers heading into the new year. Morgan Stanley also believes that industry consensus for 2019 earnings is too bullish.",BWA,en,Zero Hedge
