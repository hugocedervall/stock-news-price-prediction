2020-11-24 13:18:32-05:00,Mars just bought snack bar maker Kind for a reportedly $5 billion. Here are 5 other established food brands that could be acquired next as companies look to put cash from coronavirus-driven sales to use.,"Summary List Placement There's a paradox today for big food companies: Many are reporting their best sales in years and piling up cash as consumers eat more at home — but using that cash to make acquisitions has become trickier than it was before COVID-19. Even as products like mac n' cheese, cold cuts, and other processed and shelf-stable foods fly off the shelves, experts say companies are likely to be cautious about taking on new operations through acquisitions. Though a few major food deals have closed in 2020, such as Mondelez's $1.2 billion purchase of Give and Go , which makes frozen baked goods that can be thawed before retailers and restaurants sell them, there have been fewer acquisitions of brands by big food companies since coronavirus shook consumer habits and financial markets starting this spring. With food companies striking fewer deals, many are accumulating cash. Candy maker Mars's spent a reported $5 billion acquiring Kind, which makes snack bars. The deal provides an example of what the world's largest food companies might be willing to buy.",K,en,Business Insider

2020-11-17 19:01:00-05:00,A Unilever executive reveals how the company plans to turn its plant-based brands into a $1.1 billion business,"Summary List Placement Food companies from Kellogg to Tyson have gotten into plant-based proteins with a flurry of new product launches in the last couple of years. But Unilever is going a step further: it wants to sell €1 billion , or $1.19 billion, in plant-based foods annually over the next five-to-seven years. That level of growth would represent a quintupling of the €200 million in sales that it expects for the category in 2020. The goal will apply to sales of both plant-based substitutes for animal proteins, such as cuts of meat from The Vegetarian Butcher, which Unilever bought in 2018, and vegan versions of Magnum ice cream bars. But it also includes products that add flavor to fresh vegetables, such as Knorr packets that can be mixed with cut greens to create a salad, Executive Vice President of Foods and Refreshment for North America Jostein Solheim told Business Insider.

He is also the head of Plancorp, a full-service wealth management company, in San Francisco.

Though the plan can largely cover your retirement, Lee suggests meeting with a financial advisor first to see if it's right for you, while weighing possible alternatives. A flexible plan is the key to financial success, Lee says, so set aside emergency funds for potential withdrawals and assess whether converting the backdoor Roth into a Roth IRA would be ideal for long-term savings.

Small businesses across the US are turning to their insurance companies for emergency funding to get them through the coronavirus outbreak.

La razón reside en que los distribuidores se están centrando en priorizar el abastecimiento de los productos más importantes para evitar la escasez y simplifican las operaciones dentro del establecimiento. Esta es la conclusión que se extrae de un informe de Oliver Wyman presentado el pasado marzo en el que se predecía el comportamiento de los consumidores en España a partir del análisis de los cambios acontecidos en las compras realizadas en China durante y después la pandemia del coronavirus Las conclusiones a las que llegaba la consultora en base a lo que ocurrió en el país asiático se están cumpliendo en parte en las cadenas con sede en España ya que hay menos ofertas en las estanterías del súper, aunque no han desaparecido por completo. En este sentido, desde Oliver Wyman apuntaban a que las promociones «complican las operaciones de la tienda» al ejercer «una presión adicional en la cadena de suministro» lo que puede conllevar a una escasez de productos esenciales. «Además, la restricción de los viajes limita la cantidad de promociones que pueden elevar las ventas y el tráfico de la tienda.",K,es,ABC

As of now, there has been no such disruption - but it is beginning to morph into a massive threat, Bloomberg notes, with workers in close quarters preparing and processing food globally.

The bigger safety concern is the spraying of weed-killers like Monsanto's Roundup, which uses glyphosate as its active ingredient. More than 13,000 plaintiffs have alleged that Roundup gave them cancer. Courts have already ruled in favor of the plaintiff in three verdicts, but it's important to separate these cases from scientific evidence. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

2019-03-20 12:21:00-05:00,The weed-killing chemical involved in a Monsanto lawsuit was found in Cheerios and Quaker Oats products. Here's how worried you should be.,"A round of tests from the nonprofit Environmental Working Group found the presence of a weed-killer in breakfast foods like Cheerios and Quaker Oats products. The chemical in question, known as glyphosate, has been tentatively linked to cancer, though many scientists argue that the evidence isn't conclusive. The group's latest report said that all but two of the 28 samples showed harmful levels of glyphosate, but their safety threshold is far more stringent than the Environmental Protection Agency's standard. As the scientific community awaits further research, consumers are left to decide whether the products pose a risk. Over the past year, the Environmental Working Group has conducted multiple tests to determine the presence of weed-killer in certain breakfast foods. In August, the group published a report that found traces of glyphosate , the most widely used agricultural pesticide in the world, in dozens of Quaker, Kellogg's, and General Mills products, including cereals like Cheerios and Lucky Charms.",K,en,Business Insider

Hardeman used the weed-killer to tend his property for more than two dec ades.
