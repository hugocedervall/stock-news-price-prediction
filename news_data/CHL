Earlier this year, Beijing launched the Blockchain-Based Service Network (BSN), a system of low-cost backend architecture on which software developers around the world can build blockchain applications—including digital assets such as cryptocurrencies. The launch happened a few months after Chinese President Xi Jinping pressed for the nation to leverage blockchain technology to complement the rising economic importance of big data and the ""internet of things.""

Purchase this report. 14-Day Risk Free Trial: Get full access to this and all Connectivity & Tech research reports. In the face of rising demand for data, increasingly saturated mobile markets, and stiff opposition from legacy players, tech entrants, and startups, global telecoms are locked in a battle for market share. These market pressures have led to vicious price wars for mobile services and, as a result, declining average revenue per user (ARPU). Making matters worse, improvements in infrastructure and technology have made telecoms largely comparable in terms of coverage, connection speeds, and service pricing, meaning companies must transform their businesses if they hope to compete. For many global telecoms, shoring up market share under today's pressures while also future-proofing operations means having to invest in AI. The telecom industry is expected to invest $36.7 billion annually in AI software, hardware, and services by 2025, according to Tractica.",CHL,en,Business Insider

2019-03-14 00:00:27-05:00,"The Undersea Cable Market Is Booming Again, This Time Funded by Big Tech","(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- During the 1990s dot-com boom, phone companies spent more than $20 billion laying undersea fiber-optic cables from New York to London, through the Mediterranean, across the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and beyond. They were preparing for an expected explosion in internet traffic, but when the bubble burst at the turn of the millennium, operators unloaded cables for pennies on the dollar. That fiasco discouraged investment in the industry for the better part of a decade. Now, with data traffic surging—videos on Netflix and YouTube, songs from Spotify and Pandora, innumerable posts on Twitter and Facebook—the excess capacity has been absorbed, sparking another investment boom, with more cable laid in 2018 than in any year in almost two decades. The industry “is as strong as it’s been since they all went bust,” says Tim Stronge, vice president for research at telecom consultancy TeleGeography. “There’s an awful lot of cable going in.” The leaders of today’s boom are two of the biggest generators of data traffic: Google and Facebook.",CHL,en,Bloomberg
