If you're planning to buy in the next two to five years, you might want to consider CDs, or certificates of deposits , as a low-risk investment that could earn more than the typical high-yield savings account . For anyone waiting five years or more to buy, investing in stocks and bonds may be a good choice, but only with a small portion of your savings, caution financial planners. Read more personal finance coverage. Saving for a down payment on a house is no easy feat. In some markets, saving up a full 20% down payment can be a huge sum. For big, long-term goals like this, investing might seem like an ideal way to make money grow quickly. But, investing poses a big problem: risk. Investing your down payment fund isn't always right, especially if you're planning to buy in the next few years.

2020-03-07 10:00:08-05:00,Onward review – more emotional wizardry from Pixar,"Tom Holland and Chris Pratt give voice to brothers searching to bring their father back to life in a magical fantasy world The latest Pixar animation, Onward is heartfelt, slickly executed and potently effective as both a rousing adventure and a tear-jerker. But compared to the very best of Pixar’s output, this can’t help but feel like second tier stuff. Set in a world in which magic has atrophied from lack of use, where unicorns are trash-scavenging vermin, where chubby centaurs rely on four wheels rather than galloping forth on four legs, Onward is, like so many Pixar movies before it, a deft blend of fanciful and relatable. The backdrop, rendered in a purple-heavy palette that looks like a visual representation of acute sinus pain, is a stridently realised fantasy world; the story is down to earth and domestic, exploring the frayed bond between two brothers, Ian (voiced by Tom Holland) and Barley (Chris Pratt, exuberant), who lost their father before they got to know him. It’s the emotional rather than the visual element that does the heavy lifting.",AMP,en,The Guardian

2020-02-27 10:00:51-05:00,How Pixar's hit Onward was born from childhood bereavement,"Director Dan Scanlon tells how his own childhood loss informs the movie, which also has Disney’s first gay character. ‘We want it to feel real,’ he says Pixar/Disney is known for wringing tears from every gorgeous frame and Onward, its new big-budget offering, tells the story of two teenage elves: Ian (Tom Holland) and his older brother Barley Lightfoot (Chris Pratt), whose late father left a gift for them to open on Ian’s 16th birthday. It is a spell, which offers them an unimaginable opportunity: to spend one more day with him. Then the spell goes wrong, or rather, only half-right. The brothers are granted only Dad’s purple-socked, chino-clad, dancing legs – and a quest is required to bring all of him back. What follows is hilarious and heartbreaking, both for people who have never experienced such grief, and those who have. When Ian briefly meets an old schoolfriend of his father’s, who provides new, precious details of his life, the moment resonates powerfully, as does Ian playing a cassette of his father’s voice, with which he holds a conversation.",AMP,en,The Guardian
