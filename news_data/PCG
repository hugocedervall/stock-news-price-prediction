Gavin Newsom’s pledge to end sales of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035. CEC’s clean transportation plan released Wednesday ( PDF ) will direct $133 million for light-duty EV charging systems, and another $130 million for infrastructure for zero-emissions medium and heavy-duty vehicles, most of it electric charging. Another $70 million will go toward hydrogen refueling infrastructure, and $25 million for “zero-and near-zero carbon fuel production and supply,” to meet the need for alternatives to battery-powered vehicles in the decades to come. This week's announcement follows on Gov. Newsom’s surprise decision last month, amid record-breaking heatwaves and wildfires driven by global warming, to set a 2035 deadline for ending sales of new gasoline-fueled vehicles.

If it works, the unusual combination of a newly formed municipal utility, large electricity customers as anchor tenants, and a microgrid developer to fund and manage the solar, battery and natural gas-powered system could provide a new statewide model for towns and cities looking for reliable, clean energy options. That's how Brian Curtis, CEO of Concentric Power, views the Gonzalez Agricultural and Industrial Microgrid project. The “multi-customer municipal utility energy services agreement” announced this week could solve many of the more complex barriers to microgrid development in California, he said. “It leapfrogs some of the barriers and challenges that have been experienced in the market, not the least of which is interconnection and utility-side upgrades,” he said. “We think we’ve found a pretty elegant way to design with those constraints in mind.” Gonzales, a town of about 8,500 in the country’s most productive fruit and vegetable growing region, has a business park with two major agricultural processing facilities owned by Taylor Farms and Del Monte Foods.",PCG,en,Green Technology Media

The survey shows that only 10 per cent of central banks currently incorporate it fully across their portfolios, while half of the 50 central banks surveyed did not implement ESG measures at all. Other global public investors (GPI) like public pension plans and sovereign wealth funds have been much faster on the uptake. In comparison, 93 per cent of pension funds and half of sovereign funds apply ESG criteria across their whole portfolio. BNY Mellon and OMFIF note in the report ‘Sustainable Investment’ that the relatively weak uptake of ESG criteria for managing investments among central banks compared with their GPI peers is “in contrast to their activities as supervisors, where several institutions have taken steps or are planning to introduce regulatory measures such as climate stress tests”.",PCG,en,InstitutionAlassetManager

PG&E is now on track to meet its 2020 wildfire mitigation goals, making up for slower-than-expected progress earlier this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, CEO Bill Smith said during Thursday’s second-quarter earnings conference call. The slow rate of progress earlier in 2020 led to concerns that PG&E wouldn’t be able to complete its work by the end of August, the historical start of California’s wildfire season. The utility is also working to make this year’s public safety power shutoff “smarter, shorter, and smaller” than the widespread outages last fall , Smith said. PG&E’s grid operations staff has learned from last year’s experience to gain “improved insights to consider which circuits are considered for shutoff,” which “should result in fewer customer being impacted.” The 600 grid sectionalization devices PG&E is installing will allow lower-risk circuits to remain on while higher-risk ones are de-energized, an effort that could reduce the scope of outages by about one-third compared to last year.",PCG,en,Green Technology Media

Building performance standards have been saving Californians energy and money for four decades. Occasionally, updates to the standards, which are strengthened every three years, yield a breakthrough. In 2019, the beneficiary was solar, with regulators approving a requirement for rooftop PV arrays on most new homes in the state. In 2022, the game-changer is likely to be new rules to tip the market toward all-electric new construction . Much of the work on the 2022 update to what is officially known as California’s Title 24 Building Energy Efficiency Standards has so far been done behind the scenes by staff at the California Energy Commission (CEC). But a recent round of letters from key stakeholders signals the start of the public phase of the process. Over the past month, letters submitted to the CEC by some of the state’s largest utilities, including Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), Southern California Edison, and Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD), as well as the California Community Choice Association, all carried the same message: adopt an updated energy code that accelerates the transition to all-electric buildings. “The letters that you are seeing are basically trying to set the stage and influence that process,” Pierre Delforge, a building decarbonization expert who tracks the proceeding for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in an interview.",PCG,en,Green Technology Media

The fire burned 77,758 acres, destroyed 374 structures and forced the evacuation of about 190,000 people, though no one was killed in the blaze. PG&E had already conceded that a failed jumper cable on a transmission line was the likely cause of the fire, and has set aside $600 million in anticipation of covering resulting damages – a figure at “the lower end of the range” of potential losses, the utility wrote in its first quarter earnings report.

Last year nearly 8,000 wildfires burned over 250,000 acres of the state, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Though the state’s 2019 wildfires were severe, 2017 and 2018 were the deadliest and most destructive fire seasons in California’s history, resulting in over 100 deaths and razing thousands of homes. The 2020 fire season will undoubtedly be challenging. Higher temperatures and a persistent drought driven by climate change have extended the duration of the state’s average fire season by 75 days. As of May, California’s snowpack was at just 37 percent of the average level, an indication of just how dry and combustible conditions are. In 2019 the reality of persistent wildfire risk led California utilities to implement preventative blackouts as a way to eliminate the risk of grid equipment sparking fires.

While some steps remain in court, “I’m going to come to the conclusion that the plan should be confirmed,” Montali said. PG&E faces a long and difficult road ahead. The San Francisco-based utility is emerging from bankruptcy with a massive debt load that could make it harder to raise the tens of billions of dollars of investment needed to prevent its power grid from causing more devastating wildfires.

CCAs like East Bay Community Energy counter that the decision undermines their local clean energy and energy storage projects, and could raise prices for their customers. The “central buyer” framework adopted by the CPUC on Thursday is the result of a years-long debate over the state’s resource adequacy (RA) program for ensuring there's enough available capacity on the grid at all times. Specifically, it puts Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison in charge of managing “local RA,” or resources needed for grid reliability in the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay Area regions. Local RA is costlier for these regions, which have higher loads and constrained transmission systems served by fewer local natural-gas plants that provide most of California’s capacity needs.",PCG,en,Green Technology (Feed)

Or should it or share the money with low-income and disadvantaged communities that will otherwise be denied support for projects? That's the question facing the California Public Utilities Commission this week, as it considers an energy storage industry request to modify the state’s Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) to shift money from the former group to the latter. The petition from the California Energy Storage Association asks the CPUC to transfer $310 million in SGIP funds to projects in low-income and disadvantaged communities that otherwise won’t get state incentives. This would “support shovel-ready projects that provide economic stimulus” amid a COVID-19 pandemic-driven economic downturn, CESA wrote.

This wasn’t a typical year, though. In the fall, Northern California utility PG&E cut off power to millions of people to avoid starting fires. As the reality sank in that Bay Area homeowners couldn’t count on the grid working in a prolonged heat wave, they started taking matters into their own hands. Solar-paired batteries provide clean, silent backup power for critical loads—or the whole house, if the customer pays for enough battery capacity. California offers grants to cover the cost of batteries to households that are especially affected by power shutoffs.",PCG,en,Green Technology (Feed)

2020-05-29 12:22:00-05:00,California Clears PG&E Bankruptcy Plan as Critics Call for Public Takeover,"Pacific Gas & Electric is on the cusp of ending its year-and-a-half stint in bankruptcy. But whether it can successfully rebuild its finances and make its power grid safer without drastically raising rates on millions of customers is far from clear. On Thursday, the California Public Utilities Commission approved PG&E’s $58 billion bankruptcy plan . The unanimous vote came despite scores of public comments against allowing the company to emerge without greater government control over its safety practices. PG&E has been held criminally responsible for 84 deaths in the November 2018 Camp Fire, and is under criminal probation for its role in the deadly 2010 San Bruno natural gas pipeline explosion. Critics question whether PG&E will be able to raise the capital its transformation will require amid the COVID-19 economic downturn. Failure to do so could prevent PG&E from emerging as a “financially viable, reliable utility,” more than 200 county and city representatives wrote in a letter asking the CPUC to “pursue another path” — namely, to convert PG&E to a customer-owned utility .",PCG,en,Green Technology (Feed)

The bankrupt utility is struggling to secure its grid from causing more deadly wildfires, and has been stymied in attempts to set up natural gas-backed microgrids to power substations during fire-prevention blackouts. But California regulators are adamant that PG&E find a more permanent and less costly and polluting backup plan in the years ahead — even if it’s not clear yet what form it may take. On June 11, the California Public Utilities Commission plans to vote on a proposed decision that would greenlight PG&E’s plan to secure up to 450 megawatts of mobile generators to back up communities during public safety power outage events this summer and fall.

A mayoral candidate in Boise, Idaho, recently suggested building a wall to keep out Californians, who account for 60 percent of domestic migration into the growing state. The election of increasingly progressive candidates in Colorado sparked talk there of the “Californication” of the Centennial State. Early last year, the Dallas News described the “California-ing” of North Texas, citing a study showing that 8,300 Californians move to the area yearly. Texas governor Greg Abbott launched a petition titled “Don’t California My Texas.” Much of this anxiety revolves around fears that the migrants will transform the politics and culture of the places that they’re moving to—bringing an appetite for big, intrusive government.",PCG,en,Zero Hedge

Now it’s up to state regulators to decide which parts of their plans will move forward. On Friday, Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric filed wildfire mitigation plans with the California Public Utilities Commission, laying out their three-year plans for preventing grid-caused wildfires where possible, and limiting their damage when they do occur. The three-year plans are a sequel to the 2019 wildfire mitigation plans each utility submitted early last year. The plans included a major increase in tree-clearing and grid-hardening work, along with technologies like grid sectionalizing equipment, weather stations and mountaintop cameras, and other tools for preventing grid failures from sparking wildfires during times of high winds and hot temperatures. The plans also encompass the controversial step of public safety power shutoff (PSPS) events, like PG&E’s multi-day blackouts that left millions without power this fall, or the much smaller outages conducted by SCE and SDG&E over the past year.",PCG,en,Green Technology
2020-02-10 11:39:00-05:00,Fitch: Solar Projects Much More Reliable Performers Than Wind Farms,"It might be obvious to anyone in the renewable energy business, but a growing body of data collected by Fitch Ratings backs it up: Solar projects are a safer bet than wind farms when it comes to kicking out the expected amount of power. Many wind farms significantly underperform expectations, according to a recent Fitch analysis. On the other hand, solar arrays are proving so reliable over time that developers are finding themselves able to secure financing on more favorable terms — an important long-term tailwind for the market. Remarkably, the biggest threat to the credit ratings of some California solar projects these days is not the plants themselves, but rather questions around the future viability of their utility off-takers. ‘Rock solid’ solar performance When renewable developers approach banks for project finance, they are often asked to provide so-called P50 probabilities, which estimate how much power will be generated on an annual basis. Taking a range of factors into account, from long-term weather assessments to how similar equipment has performed in the past, a P50 forecast puts a number on how much a project is expected to generate in a given year; half the time it should crank out more power than its P50 forecast, and half the time less.",PCG,en,Green Technology

Gavin Newsom’s demands for greater safety, oversight and accountability. But the plan, which has already won over a competing group of Wall Street bondholders and the vast majority of victims of 2017 and 2018 wildfires caused by PG&E’s equipment, still doesn’t meet one of Newsom’s key demands: a structure that could allow the state to take over the utility if it fails to meet future safety commitments. This kind of “self-destruct” mechanism could present multiple legal quandries, making it a hard sell for investors and potentially threatening PG&E’s ability to win the financial backing it needs to emerge from bankruptcy by June 30. That’s the deadline it must meet to gain access to the state’s $21 billion wildfire insurance fund, seen as a key condition for its future stability.

The California-based developer is increasingly garnering attention for its eye-popping project sizes and aggressive move into paired storage. The recent announcements are “the culmination of years-worth of effort,” said Sean Kiernan, the company’s senior vice president of development, but they're also the result of 8minute’s focused development approach. The rift between Buttgenbach and Hermann stemmed in part from disagreements about whether to keep 8minute’s developments in the U.S. or go global. With Buttgenach’s U.S.-centric vision the winner, 8minute has been reaping the rewards.",PCG,en,Green Technology

Wood Mackenzie is currently tracking 2,430 operational microgrids across the United States, developed by 187 developers. Most of those 187 developers* have only developed one project, and many of these developers are also the end customer. But 17 of them are not customers and can claim at least two projects each. This small group of developers has executed over 90 percent of the country’s microgrids. A new Wood Mackenzie insight outlines what these 17 top developers’ strategies say about the future of microgrid development. Technology-neutral versus product-led The 17 non-customer developers with multiple projects on the books all employ either a technology-neutral or a product-led strategy. They tend to have experience integrating many different distributed energy resources. These technology-neutral developers typically integrate a generation or energy storage asset on the customer site that predates the microgrid. These developers are generally microgrid control companies, energy service companies, or engineering, procurement and construction companies.",PCG,en,Green Technology

Now, a potentially significant opportunity is coming into focus for them: home battery systems. 2019 was a big year for both residential solar and home storage in the U.S. Power shutoffs in California and demand pull-in from the Investment Tax Credit helped both industries log new records. Yet while much of the attention on solar-plus-storage has focused on leading national installers — SunPower unveiled its in-house residential storage product in September — conversations with local solar installers across the country show that, heading into 2020, interest in storage is trickling into many more sales conversations. It’s a trend that underscores the growing interconnect between the two sectors. Rooftop solar remains a vastly larger market than home storage systems.

Now California regulators are proposing a new role for SGIP: giving battery-solar backup systems to those at greatest risk of wildfires and blackouts. On Wednesday, the California Public Utilities Commission issued a proposed decision ( PDF ) that would shift the majority of SGIP’s roughly $815 million budget through 2024 away from standard behind-the-meter battery systems, and towards its “equity resilience budget.” That’s the budget for low income, disadvantaged or medically vulnerable people who live in areas at high risk of wildfires and fire-prevention public safety power shutoff (PSPS), like the blackouts that left millions of customers of bankrupt utility Pacific Gas & Electric without power for days at a time this fall. In September, the CPUC directed $100 million in previously funded “equity budget” spending toward these high-risk customers, along with a boosted incentive of $1 per watt-hour that can almost completely cover the up-front costs of a typical residential solar-storage system.",PCG,en,Green Technology

2019-12-12 00:01:22-05:00,Residential Solar Hits New Peak in US with Record Q3 Installations,"The U.S. residential solar industry pulled off an all-time record for installations in the third quarter, according to new research from Wood Mackenzie and the Solar Energy Industries Association. And it happened with Northeastern states — traditionally powerhouses in the sector — completely absent from a ranking of the top five state markets. California still accounted for about 40 percent of all installations in Q3. But the Northeast's grip on residential solar waned, with other regions rising. Record quarters in 15 states were enough to break another record at the national level, with the U.S. adding 712 megawatts of new residential systems, an increase of 8 percent from the same period last year. Substantial growth occurred in mainstays like California as well as in budding state markets such as Wyoming and Iowa. While solar success spread throughout the U.S., though, the Northeast faced headwinds. Several states kept installation volumes steady, where in the past they'd shown growth. “Higher levels of saturation and the resulting steep customer-acquisition costs have slowed installation volumes since peak installation years, as the market grows past early-adopter consumers,” write WoodMac analysts of the region.",PCG,en,Green Technology

In looking back at 2019’s most important developments on the grid edge — GTM's term for the interface of the traditional utility enterprise with the rooftop solar panels, behind-the-meter batteries, plug-in electric vehicles, and other distributed energy resources (DERs) — it’s hard to overstate the impact of California’s wildfires and power outages on the U.S. market. Over the course of 2019, we’ve seen California, the country’s leader in most DERs, wracked by a climate change-induced emergency that’s bankrupted its largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, and forced millions to go without power during fire-prevention blackouts.

Front-of-meter storage deployments boomed in Q3 compared to a lackluster second quarter , with Massachusetts deploying 58 megawatt-hours of systems, Vermont and Arkansas tying for second with 24 megawatt-hours apiece, and Texas coming in third with 10 megawatts.

Sunrun is looking at double-digit growth in deployments compared to last year. Vivint is cranking along. Tesla met the lower bar of proving it can grow deployments quarter-over-quarter instead of declining. And Sunnova, which finances and partners with a network of local installers, launched an initial public offering. Meanwhile, a series of wildfires and wildfire-related grid outages in California, solar’s largest market, made the combination of home solar-plus-batteries look more crucial than ever.

The outage affecting 34 counties and an estimated 2 million people was marked by a breakdown in communications , including the crash of the PG&E web site serving as the sole source of outage information for the public and city, county and state agencies alike. PG&E also failed to coordinate with local governments and tribal communities before and during the event, and failed to plan for how its outages could require backup power for key infrastructure like highway tunnels or railroad crossings. All in all, the CPUC accused PG&E of an outage that was “ill-conceived, poorly planned, uncoordinated (both internally and externally) and ineffectively communicated.” PG&E could face fines of up to $100,000 for each violation, which include its failure to contact about 23,000 customers, including 500 medically vulnerable customers, that they were about to lose power.",PCG,en,Green Technology

That divergence from standard operating procedure poses a question for the embattled utility: How will it take care of its millions of customers without power when the risk of starting a wildfire gets too high? The October fires and shutoffs inspired a flurry of commentary on how microgrids and distributed energy can save the day, by localizing power production in communities and allowing them to operate independently of the broader, fire-threatened grid.

Since the start of October, at least 58 fires have burned in 27 of the state's 59 counties, impacting 122,042 acres and leading to the evacuation of more than 200,000 residents during a declared state of emergency.

The shutoffs have been pursued most recently and notoriously by California utility Pacific Gas & Electric but more modestly by Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric. Though the company knocks on “millions of doors a year,” CEO David Bywater said on the company’s Q3 earnings call that recent power outages have pushed all potential customers to reconsider renewables and storage. “Every door is a fresh door again, because with time-of-use and these rolling blackouts, consumers who didn’t purchase in the past … are reevaluating this decision. It kind of resets the market,” Bywater said. “These conversations today are not only going solar but consider storage.” Last month PG&E turned power off for millions of Californians in efforts to prevent wildfires from sparking. Despite the shutoffs, the utility is now under scrutiny for the possibility that its equipment caused the Kincade fire in Sonoma County, which has burned near 80,000 acres.",PCG,en,Green Technology

PG&E Price Targets Reflect Uncertain Outlook On Wall Street,"PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG ) shares were hammered Thursday after a bankruptcy judge ruled that PG&E will not have exclusive rights to propose a chapter 11 bankruptcy plan, opening the door for alternative plans from bondholders.

2019-04-26 09:50:12-05:00,Why Bankrupt PG&E Isn't Trading At $0,"It’s been a wild ride for PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG ) investors in the last few months. The stock had dropped down 74 percent to under $7 per share in three months when the company officially filed for bankruptcy Jan. 29. Since that filing, the stock has actually skyrocketed 66 percent. PG&E’s decision to file for bankruptcy came as the company faced billions of dollars in potential liabilities related to California wildfires in 2017 and 2018. This week, the company asked state regulators to allow a price hike that would raise California residents’ average monthly electric bill by 7.2 percent as PG&E navigates bankruptcy. Expert Take Robin Deshayes, President and Chief Strategy Officer of Miltonian Capital Management, joined Benzinga’s PreMarket Prep on Friday to shed some light on the bizarre situation at PG&E. Deshayes noted this isn’t the first time PG&E has been in hot water. “There was an energy crisis back in the early 2000s, and there were a lot of blackouts. It was caused by the relationship between the California utilities and Enron, who was selling them power contracts,” Deshayes said.",PCG,en,Benzinga

2019-01-07 18:15:00-05:00,California Isn't Buying PG&E Bankruptcy Threats,"PG&E shares tumbled another 20% on Monday as the embattled utility, which is potentially facing billions of dollars in fines stemming from the deadliest wildfires in the state's history (while simultaneously struggling to settle claims related to a round of fires that decimated California's wine country in 2017), is facing pushback and skepticism from lawmakers following reports last week that it could file for bankruptcy as soon as next month. According to Bloomberg , California lawmakers, who had been expected to bail out the utility, are questioning the political prudence of caving to the utilities bankruptcy threats. It's widely suspected that the threat of a bankruptcy filing would force the California legislature to pass a law allowing PG&E to pass costs related to the fires on to its customers - an outcome that would risk enraging Californians who suspect that the utility's equipment contributed to starting the deadly Camp and Woolsey Fires. As investigators press ahead with their probe into what caused the deadly fires, the issue of what should be done to hold PG&E accountable for any role in the fires could be one of the first major issues facing California's newly inaugurated governor, Gavin Newsom, who was sworn into office on Monday.",PCG,en,Zero Hedge
