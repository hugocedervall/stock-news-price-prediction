They think it's good for them. That candy — colorful, chewy, shaped like orange slices and teddy bears — is the gummy vitamin. Shmerling, who's been a rheumatologist in the Boston area for three decades and is a professor at Harvard Medical School, said some of his patients were taking a dozen supplements, gummy or otherwise, every day. ""Half of them, they're not even sure what it's for,"" he said. It's not the sugar in each vitamin that concerns him, although with an average of 3 grams a serving , it adds up. Rather, Shmerling thinks his patients should simply eat better. Instead of, say, buying a $55 pack of gummies made with blue algae, wheatgrass, barley, and other veggies, they should probably just eat their veggies. It's an amusing juxtaposition — adults who are health-conscious enough to care about their vitamin and mineral intake but don't mind starting their day off with candy.

Dr Reddy’s will have the licence to sell volume-limited amounts of the Revlimid capsule in the US from March 2022.This is a very important settlement for Dr Reddy and the Street has been waiting for this. From an opportunity perspective, it will kind of give Dr Reddy very large sales numbers but since the volume details are not disclosed, in my view, on a very conservative basis the drug can add about $300 million to their sales in FY23-FY24.

2019-01-23 11:12:46-05:00,"Einhorn's Greenlight Capital Up 11% YTD, Will Start Taking Outside Money Again","After a year where nothing went right for David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital (the firm's main fund lost 34% in 2018, its worst year on record) the dramatic rebound in equities has led to a dramatic reversal of fortunes. The fund is now up 11% YTD, inspiring Einhorn to start taking on new money again, according to Reuters. The fund posted positive returns during only two months last year, May and October. Einhorn reportedly announced his plans at the firm's annual investor day on Tuesday, which it held at the Museum of Natural History in New York. Maybe some of the investors who pulled money out at a rapid clip last year (shrinking the firm's assets to $2.5 billion from $12 billion in 2014) might want to reconsider. The fund hasn't taken on new money in years. It won't embark on a marketing drive; instead, any would-be investors will need to contact Greenlight directly. Einhorn's fund wasn't alone in its poor returns last year: the hedge fund industry suffered its worst quarterly outflow in more than two years during Q4, when investors yanked $23 billion from hedge funds.",PRGO,en,Zero Hedge
