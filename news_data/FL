As such, Wilson recommended using a near term sell-off as a buying opportunity.

Authored by John Whitehead via The Rutherford Institute, Cash may well become a casualty of the COVID-19 pandemic… As these COVID-19 lockdowns drag out, more and more individuals and businesses are going cashless (for convenience and in a so-called effort to avoid spreading coronavirus germs), engaging in online commerce or using digital forms of currency (bank cards, digital wallets, etc.). As a result, physical cash is no longer king. Yet there are other, more devious, reasons for this re-engineering of society away from physical cash: a cashless society—easily monitored, controlled, manipulated, weaponized and locked down—would play right into the hands of the government (and its corporate partners). To this end, the government and its corporate partners-in-crime have been waging a subtle war on cash for some time now. What is this war on cash? It’s a concerted campaign to shift consumers towards a digital mode of commerce that can easily be monitored, tracked, tabulated, mined for data, hacked, hijacked and confiscated when convenient.",FL,en,Zero Hedge

Funko was hardly affected due to its large and diversified customer base, multiple sales channels, and devoted shoppers. The liquidation of Toys R Us and closure of more than 800 of its toy stores hammered Hasbro, Mattel, Spin Master and Jakks Pacific last year, as their recent results show. The only major toy stock to escape the fallout was Funko, thanks to its diversified customer base, range of sales channels, and devoted buyers. How did Funko dodge the Toys R Us bullet? In stark contrast to its peers, Funko's sales jumped 33% to $686 million last financial year, driving operating profit up 51% to $63.5 million. Funko - which makes pop-culture figurines and bobbleheads under licence from Disney, Netflix, Nintendo, Warner Bros. and others - relied on Toys R Us for less than 4% of its sales in 2017, meaning its sales were hardly affected by the retailer's sudden demise. The key differences between Funko and rivals are that its "" products are channel-agnostic, and we have a diverse set of customers, of which no retailer accounts for more than 10% of our year's sales to date,"" CEO Brian Mariotti said on the group's third-quarter earnings call .
