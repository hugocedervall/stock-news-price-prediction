Here's what its executives are watching to determine whether it works.,"Summary List Placement The concept of a four-day workweek isn't new. Leaders from Microsoft executives to former presidential hopeful Andrew Yang advocating for the alternative schedule. But two factors convinced Nick Bangs, Unilever's Managing Director for New Zealand, to take the plunge and implement it for a year among the consumer good giant's workforce in the country. One was the global spread of coronavirus. Bangs told Business Insider that Unilever was motivated by New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's call for companies to consider more flexible schedules and work arrangements for Kiwi workers as the pandemic disrupted daily life.

2020-12-04 14:03:00-05:00,MOBILE ORDER-AHEAD AND DELIVERY: How leading payments facilitators can help restaurants tap into industry demand and win volume,"Summary List Placement As the pandemic and subsequent stay-at-home orders slashed consumer spending and shuttered in-person dining, restaurant revenues took a substantial hit, especially at full-service eateries. And even as dining has reopened nationwide, ongoing capacity restrictions and consumer wariness have kept customers home and left engagement down by double digits. As restaurants continue to struggle to earn revenues, they've been forced to adapt their operations in order to keep their doors open. Implementing digital technology has become the core tool restaurants are using to stay afloat. The sector was already on the rise prior to the pandemic, especially at quick-service restaurants (QSRs): We expected mobile order-ahead annual sales volume would hit $31 billion this year. But the pandemic pushed restaurants to expand their usage of the technology for pickup, delivery, and even in-person dining, bringing penetration to levels not expected until 2023. And as ecommerce remains prominent across the board and the long-stretching pandemic cements newfound habits, the trend is likely here to stay.",SHAK,en,Business Insider
