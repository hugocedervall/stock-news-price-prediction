2020-09-08 15:24:56.000,A $5 million prize spurs competition for new Covid-19 rapid test,"By Olivia Raimonde and Janet WuAs countries race to develop a Covid-19 vaccine, just determining who’s infected remains a major challenge.Large-scale testing is a crucial element in containing the virus, experts say, because many who contract it exhibit little to no symptoms. Without widespread testing, it’s a daunting task to identify contagious individuals and isolate them.To help meet that challenge, the XPRIZE Foundation, which aims to spur technological and industry advancements, is offering a $5 million prize to develop a new Covid-19 rapid test. Competitors can enter until midnight Tuesday. Since July, 659 teams from 68 countries have registered.Currently, test results for the novel coronavirus can take up to two weeks, creating headaches for medical professionals, public-health experts and elected officials. Without the ability to test people often and with speedy results, many cases may go undetected, which can lead to new clusters of infections.“We have, like everyone else around the globe, seen the impact this has had on mental health, physical health, bringing the wheels off of the economy,” said Anousheh Ansari, chief executive officer of the XPRIZE Foundation. “We always look at innovation to solve grand challenges.”Ansari and her family poured millions into funding the first XPRIZE in 2004 that launched the commercial space race.",ABT,en,Economic Times India

Swiss giant Roche Holding AG is following up with its own version.Antibodies are markers of infection, and testing for them helps health officials see how widely the virus has spread. Until now, most tests could tell only whether they’re present. The newer ones go a step further, measuring the quantity of these proteins, which are raised by the immune system to disable viral invaders.The level of the body’s response is important in determining whether patients will develop immunity. It’s also key to determining the effectiveness of vaccines as developers bring promising candidates into late-stage trials.“You need a test that shows whether a vaccine has triggered the right level of antibodies in a patient’s blood,” said Deepak Nath, president of laboratory diagnostics at Healthineers. “It’s important to say how much of it you have.”Vaccine TrialsModerna Inc. used a form of quantitative testing to show that all 45 participants in a phase I trial of its experimental coronavirus vaccine developed antibodies.",ABT,en,Economic Times India

2020-07-27 10:04:07.000,The U.S. has more COVID-19 testing than most. So why is it falling so short?,"By Allison Martell and Ned Parker (Reuters) - The United States might have more COVID-19 testing capacity than any other country. So why have we seen laboratories overwhelmed and many patients again waiting a week or more for results? At the heart of the crisis is a reliance by public and private labs on automated testing equipment that locks them in to using proprietary chemical kits and other tools made by a handful of manufacturers. The result: as infection rates spike nationwide, many labs aren't running anywhere near capacity because of supply-chain bottlenecks, according to Reuters interviews with 16 hospital, state, commercial and academic labs and an analysis of state and city procurement plans. A few companies – Cepheid, Hologic Inc, Roche and Abbott Laboratories – dominate this market. Their machines run on chemical kits and disposable plastic parts like sample plates and pipettes that only they sell, much like branded printer cartridges.

What are the odds, right? ""Please discontinue patient testing and return of diagnostic results to patients until proper authorization is obtained,"" the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) wrote in a memo, addressed to the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network (SCAN), according to The New York Times . SCAN posted an update on its website on Thursday (May 14) describing how the FDA had asked it to ""pause"" testing while it receives further guidance on new procedures for its COVID-19 test kits that collect samples at home. The FDA ""recently clarified its guidance for home-based, self-collected samples to test for COVID-19. We have been notified that a separate federal emergency use authorization (EUA) is required to return results for self-collected tests,"" the post read. ""The FDA has not raised any concerns regarding the safety and accuracy of SCAN's test, but we have been asked to pause testing until we receive that additional authorization."" An FDA spokesperson told The Times, the home collection test kits raised some concerns about ""safety and accuracy that required the agency's review."" The issue in the Seattle case appears to be that the test results are being used not only by researchers for surveillance of the virus in the community but that the results are also being returned to patients to inform them.",ABT,en,Zero Hedge

The medical cannabis marketplace is currently much more prevalent globally, even though the recreational sector thrives throughout the North American region. Nevertheless, recreational cannabis use is still allowed in countries such as the Netherlands , Spain , and even Colombia . Despite the worldwide use of cannabis, the industry remains heavily hindered by a lack of large-scale, clinical research and studies. This lack has led many countries to mistakenly assume that cannabis is simply a debilitating drug. Various government bodies are now demanding more clinical trial results in order to better understand the efficacy of cannabis and reverse the stigma that surrounds the plant. So far, research has concluded that the psychoactive effects are derived from the THC or tetrahydrocannabinol compound found within the cannabis plant.","ABT,ABBV",en,Benzinga

2019-04-25 13:00:00.000,New Marketplaces Emerge for the Rapidly Expanding Cannabis Industry,"NEW YORK , April 25, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- The cannabis industry has reached some significant milestones in recent years. Perhaps most notably, Canada's legalization of recreational use cannabis was a historic event, marking the country as the first G-7 to legalize cannabis entirely. However, the remaining G-7 nations, excluding Japan , have since adopted a form of cannabis legislation. The G-7, or Group of Seven, is classified as the seven countries with the largest economies in the world as collectively, the seven nations account for 58% of global wealth. France , Germany , Italy , the U.K., and the majority of the U.S. have all legalized cannabis for medicinal use. Additionally, the U.S. has ten states, and the District of Columbia , that have legalized cannabis for recreational use. On a regional basis, the North American segment is expected to account for the largest share within the cannabis industry. However, other emerging countries such as Australia and Germany are also expected to become multi-billion marketplaces by 2027, according to ArcView Research and BDS Analytics.","ABT,ABBV",en,Benzinga

2019-04-18 13:00:00.000,Latin American Countries Offer Unique Benefits to Cannabis Cultivators,"NEW YORK , April 18, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- In 2017, the United Nations World Drug report highlighted that 183 million people consumed cannabis, representing 3.8% of the world's population. Furthermore, it was reported that 129 countries were cultivating cannabis. Predominantly, most countries which have adopted cannabis legislation have legalized the plant specifically for medical purposes. The recreational segment of the market still remains strictly enforced in almost every country, however. Nevertheless, the Latin American region was among the first to change the perspective of cannabis. Uruguay was the first country ever to legalize cannabis entirely, meaning users are allowed to freely consume cannabis for both medical and recreational applications. Moreover, other Latin American countries have moved to loosen regulations regarding cannabis as well. Countries such as Argentina , Chile , Colombia , and Brazil have all legalized medical cannabis, while some have also decriminalized cannabis, allowing for moderate personal consumption.","ABT,ABBV",en,Benzinga
