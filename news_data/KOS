2020-07-09 00:46:20-05:00,"To deal or not to deal, that is the question...","Foreword <span/> While Africa's geological appeal for frontier oil and gas exploration will remain strong relative to other regions (one quarter of the new reserves discovered worldwide in the past decade are African), the early 2020 oil price crash will have significant and long-lasting impacts on upstream activity within the continent. Trends that were set in motion after the 2014 oil price collapse are likely to be exacerbated. We will discuss the African upstream trends observed over the last decade - providing some insight into the evolving strategies of regionally grouped companies and attempting to make sense of these in the context of the most recent crash. We will also look at exploration activity over the same period with the view to drawing insights from the 2014 crash and applying those to the current environment and outlook. A drama in three acts Three distinct periods are defined within the scope of this article, driven by crashes in the oil price: A) Pre-2014 crash Between 2010 and 2014, oil was trading in the region of USD 100/bbl and Africa was attracting significant interest from large European, North American and Asian oil and gas companies.",KOS,en,IHS Markit

2020-05-04 14:51:18-05:00,Business: Equatorial Guinea takes bold action to aid explorers,"The Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons will grant two-year block extensions and ease capex requirements for E&P companies amid industry downturn; major U.S. upstream firms to benefit include Kosmos Energy, VAALCO Energy and more; the measure reflects broader efforts to drive global investment into Equatorial Guinea in line with its 2020 Year of Investment campaign, which will host the Africa Oil & Investment Forum & Exhibition in Malabo on November 25-26, 2020. In a decisive show of support to upstream industry, Equatorial Guinea’s Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons announced on Monday that it will extend exploration licenses for two years and relax capital expenditure requirements for E&P companies amid the low-price climate and reduction in oil demand caused by COVID-19. The extension of time and resources will particularly aid U.S. companies, which represent the lion’s share of investment in Equatorial Guinea’s energy sector and are currently in the early stages of exploration and seismic interpretation of several key offshore blocks. “We learned from the crisis in 2014/2015 that we need to give extensions to exploration companies to ensure that they save cash,” says H.E.",KOS,en,African Manager

Brent crude prices have tumbled by more than 42% to around $26 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude has more than halved to less than $20 per barrel since Saudi Arabia and Russia launched a price war in March. WTI crashed into unprecedented negative territory last month. The world is also witnessing one of its biggest demand shocks, as travel curbs due to the coronavirus outbreak have crimped oil consumption by millions of barrels per day. Chevron on Friday said it would further cut its spending by $2 billion to $14 billion, bringing total cuts to $6 billion or 30% Exxon Mobil last month cut its 2020 exploration expenditure by the same, while ConocoPhillips cut its spending for a second time.

2020-02-27 04:40:44-05:00,'We will be prepared to part company': Could BP's exit from three major oil and gas trade bodies set a new industry standard?,"Decision to quit three US trade bodies stems from differences over carbon pricing policies and methane regulation, as oil giant looks to build on net zero plans High profile corporates have left trade bodies in disagreements over climate policy before. Unilever and Apple have made headlines by heading for the exit door on a number of occasions, while Shell last summer quit the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) trade body, warning that ""in cases of material misalignment"" over climate policy the company would be ""prepared to walk away"". Now BP has added to the trend as it looks to build on its recent net zero goal, yesterday announcing it is to leave three US-based oil and gas trade organisations after conducting an in-depth review that concluded their climate policies and activites no longer align with its own. The move follows the energy giant's adoption earlier this month of an ambition to reach net-zero across its operations and oil and gas production base by 2050, and will fuel hopes that it is serious about coming forward with a raft of new initiatives to help accelerate its decarbonisation efforts, even if campaigners remain sceptical about the pace of emission reduction the company is considering.",KOS,en,BusinessGreen

At TipRanks, we use a system we call the "" smart score .

Those stocks at the tippety top of the scale score a perfect 10 -- and over the last eight years they've outperformed the average S&P 500 stock by more than 70%.
