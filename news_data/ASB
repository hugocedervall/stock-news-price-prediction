2020-01-30 15:48:29-05:00,"AB5 May Be Especially Tough On Older Hispanic Drivers, Fleet Owner Says","California's Assembly Bill 5 (AB5) has caused headaches for many owner-operators in the state for the past year. One Southern California-based fleet owner fears AB5's implementation could harm the livelihoods of California's older Hispanic trucker population in particular. FreightWaves reported in October on the growing number of Hispanics in the U.S. trucking industry. With estimates currently around 12% of drivers nationwide, Hispanic representation in the industry is not far behind the ethnic group's total percentage of the U.S. population, which is currently second behind non-Hispanic whites at 18%. Sandra Alzate, vice president of Southwest Trucking Group LLC, recently told FreightWaves that complying with AB5 poses a threat to California's Hispanic drivers, specifically the older drivers who've grown accustomed to life on the road as independent truckers. ""In my opinion, the older Hispanics are a little more afraid or don't exactly know how to go about it,"" Alzate said. ""They have no resources a lot of times to find out what needs to be done."" Although a federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction that temporarily blocks enforcement of AB5 against the trucking industry, many veteran Hispanic drivers have leaned on Alzate for advice on complying with the law, she said.",ASB,en,Benzinga Feeds
2020-01-27 09:24:03-05:00,AB5 GUIDE: California's new contractor bill is shaking up the gig economy. Here's everything businesses and freelancers need to know about navigating the law.,"California Assembly Bill 5 (AB5) requires company workers to be considered as employees. AB5, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, impacts how companies like Uber and Doordash manage workers who are currently recognized as contractors. The hirer must use an ABC test to prove that workers are independent contractors. Business Insider regularly covers legal changes that affect how you work. You can read them all by subscribing to BI Prime. California Assembly Bill 5 affects how companies recognize people who work for them. Better known as AB5, the bill tightens the definition of ""independent contractor"" and requires employers to conduct ABC tests to determine whether or not their workers should be classified as full-time employees. The bill minimizes the amount of work which can be conducted by freelancers and contractors without being considered full-timers. The intention is to prevent employers from taking tax shortcuts and to provide workers who should be classified as employees with healthcare, workers' compensation, paid time off, and other rights.",ASB,en,Business Insider
2020-01-13 11:19:22-05:00,"California Volumes Collapse, Capacity Tightens In Front Of AB5; Is It A Coincidence?","Chart of the Week: Outbound Tender Volume Index, Outbound Tender Rejection Index – California SONAR : OTVI.CA, OTRI.CA The California market exploded in 2019, with volumes averaging almost 30% higher from February through October according to FreightWaves Outbound Tender Volume Index (OTVI) for the state. This is a substantial increase in any year, but it especially impressive considering the 2019 freight market was considered a shadow of the previous year. In November, however, those volumes fell off the proverbial cliff, with volumes falling 18% in the first week of November. Strangely, capacity tightened as demand fell, with tender rejection rates increasing from under 3.5% to over 5% as volumes fell. Could the approach of Assembly Bill 5 (AB5) have something to do with this counter-intuitive movement? Last week a California state court decided the AB5 legislation cannot apply to the trucking industry due to being overridden by a federal law . This is a strong indication that trucking companies will not be forced to treat independent owner-operators as full-time employees in the state.",ASB,en,Benzinga Feeds
