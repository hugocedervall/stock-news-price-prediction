Coronavirus has caused near-term volatility among utility stocks, but Morgan Stanley says investors should look through the noise. The bank recommends investing in utility stocks that are low-risk and undervalued or high-risk and ""deeply undervalued."" It lays out four drivers of outperformance including a ""second wave"" of renewable energy that promises to wipe out many of the country's coal plants. Visit Markets Insider to view the latest on oil prices . Utilities have long been considered safe havens for investors. They provide essential products like electricity and gas — which people need even in a downturn — and typically they offer high dividends. But what happens when demand for electricity drops off? In the wake of a pandemic that closed large swaths of the country, US demand for electricity was down as much as 14% in some cities last month. For the year, analysts at Morgan Stanley led by Stephen Byrd expect power demand to be down by about 5% overall.","ETR,ES",en,Business Insider

Vineyard Wind is a joint venture of Iberdrola’s Avangrid utility and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners.
