2020-09-04 14:05:00,"Utility Global Comes Out with Bold Claims for Cheaper, Cleaner ‘Blue’ Hydrogen","Utility Global, a Utah-based startup focused on solid oxide electrolyzer technology, claims to have received investment offers from oil majors after coming up with what it calls a hydrogen breakthrough. The innovation is a new solid oxide electrochemical reactor design that Utility Global, a spinout from Utah research hub Hall Labs, says can be used to deliver blue hydrogen 30 percent cheaper and with 30 percent less carbon emissions than traditional steam methane reforming. Blue hydrogen is made from natural gas in the process of steam methane reformation, with the resulting emissions curtailed through carbon capture and storage. Blue hydrogen is one of several methods aiming to cut the carbon emissions associated with industrial production of the gas. It is purportedly cleaner than the current industrial processes but still a long way from being zero-emission or ‘green’ hydrogen, which is made using renewable power and electrolyzers. Like the green variety, blue hydrogen is expensive to produce compared to the traditional carbon-intensive production processes used today.",AFC,en,Green Technology Media
