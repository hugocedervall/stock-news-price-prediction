Alles appeared before the House Oversight Committee alongside the CEOs of Teva and Bristol-Myers Squibb as part of a House investigation into the pricing of Teva's Multiple Sclerosis drug Copaxone and Bristol-Myers Squibb's multiple myeloma drug Revlimid. Alles served as CEO of Celgene before it was acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb in 2019. ""Since launching Revlimid in 2005, Celgene raised the price of the drug 22 times, from $215 per pill to $719 per pill,"" according to documents from House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney . ""After Bristol Myers Squibb obtained the rights to Revlimid last November, it raised the price of Revlimid again, to $763 per pill. Due to these price increases, a monthly course of Revlimid is priced at $16,023 today — more than triple the 2005 price."" During the congressional hearing Wednesday, Porter, a former consumer protection attorney, tore into Alles, writing key figures in her questions — such as how much the CEO makes, how much a single pill of Revlimid cost over the years, and how much his bonus was as a result — on a whiteboard to striking effect.

For boomers wondering where to start when it comes to retirement saving and investing, there are plenty of options out there that can both limit risk and potentially generate big returns. Here are eight ways to invest for retirement. 1. Savings And Cash Accounts One of the most risk-free places to put retirement funds is in high-yield savings accounts, cash accounts or certificates of deposit. These options are FDIC insured for up to $250,000 per person per bank, but the typical yields are relatively low. Today, investors can expect to max out their annual cash returns in the 2% to 2.75% range, slightly higher than the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation target. 2. Bonds Bonds essentially allow companies and governments to borrow money from investors and pay them back over time with interest.

2019-05-22 03:00:01-05:00,India’s Biggest Drugmaker Plans to Start Developing Its Own Medicines,"(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- You’d be hard-pressed to find someone who’s lost more during the recent upheaval in the generic drug business than Dilip Shanghvi: He forfeited $17 billion to be precise, plus the title of India’s richest man. After a four-year decline that erased 65% from the value of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., the drugmaker he founded, Shanghvi is preparing to bounce back. He’s doing it by borrowing a page from Big Pharma’s playbook: investing in higher-margin patented medicines rather than relying solely on copying drugs. That won’t be easy, especially when the multinationals that dominate the pharmaceutical business have already seen the payoffs from their massive research and development spending become more uncertain. Those giants are increasingly turning to acquisitions to fill out their pipelines, and that’s where Shanghvi also sees an opening. Aided by an ability to move quickly because of Sun Pharma’s relatively small size—it had only about $4 billion in sales in 2018, compared with Pfizer Inc.’s $53.6 billion—and streamlined decision-making, Shanghvi thinks the company can eventually pick up enough early-stage innovations and key personnel to generate half its revenue from patented medicines. “It does require some additional skills beyond what a typical generic has,” Shanghvi says, but those skills aren’t impossible to acquire.",TEVA,en,Bloomberg

The 500-page case filed by US states on May 10 charged global biggies like Teva, Pfizer, Sandoz and Mylan, as well as domestic companies like Sun Pharma’s US arm Taro, Zydus, Lupin, Aurobindo, Dr Reddy’s, Wockhardt and Glenmark with conspiring to inflate prices of medicines, and stifling competition for generic drugs.The lawsuit widens a complaint of price collusion filed in 2016, which is still pending in US courts after being first investigated in 2014. Domestic companies said they would defend these allegations. A Sun Pharma spokesperson said, “We believe the allegations made in these lawsuits are without merit, and we will continue to vigorously defend against them.”The US probe on price-fixing seems to have impacted the domestic pharma sector overall, with stock prices of most companies witnessing a drop on the BSE in the range of 4-9% on Monday.",TEVA,en,The Economic Times India

Aimovig costs roughly $7,000 a year and was the first of a new category of migraine drugs to get to market.
