Observers wondered whether mega-lines like Carnival, prevented from sailing in US waters by CDC edicts since March, might even survive. It wasn't just passenger tickets and onboard meals that businesses like Carnival were losing out on. Luxury retail at Carnival alone is thought to make up $300 million, according to one expert . And those losses in retail made up part of Carnival's 50% decline in revenue in the 12 months ending on August 2020 . Malls have become a mainstay of mega-ship design, from duty-free staples like liquor and tobacco to onboard galleries selling prints and paintings and an increasing number of branded boutiques from luxury marques like Bulgari.

But this year is different. Events marking the 11th day of the 11th month have been cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic in the western city of Cologne, one of the country's Carnival heartlands, where tens of thousands of people normally gather every year for parades. Late last month, Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker announced a ban on alcohol consumption in public and sales of alcohol in shops for the whole of Wednesday, on top of existing coronavirus-related restrictions. ""This year, it is just a day on the calendar like any other,"" Reker said on making the announcement. Hundreds of police were deployed to the city's streets to ensure the rules were adhered to. Also on Wednesday, some 120 people gathered in central Cologne to protest coronavirus containment measures. Some held banners alluding to conspiracy theories including one with the slogan: ""Stop the Deep State."" The rally comes after a court in Muenster found that some of the coronavirus restrictions in place in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia were unlawful.

The question everyone has, especially Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy and Robinhood traders, is when the Great Cruise Shutdown of 2020 will end? While some cruise ship operations have resumed in Europe, many operations in North America remain closed. The CDC recently extended a no-sail order for U.S.-based cruise ships through Oct. 31, which could pave the way for a possible November restart. However, a November restart seems unlikely as the U.S. has made little progress in lowering its baseline of COVID-19 cases . After President Trump announced Friday that he and his wife tested positive for the virus, the U.S.'s average daily new cases on Friday stood around 46,300. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the NIAID and member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said not too long ago, that ""no matter how you slice it, that's not good.""

With national economies suffering from revenue shortages, and populations in need of additional government support to mitigate the impacts of the crisis, SWFs have in many cases seen their roles transformed. As a result of reduced income, many governments have been tapping SWFs to help balance budgets and provide stimulus to businesses or households. This development has changed the conventional wisdom surrounding SWFs, which have combined assets estimated of around $6trn globally. Before the pandemic the funds were seen as having limited – or a total lack of – liabilities.

That moon may have taken part in a phenomenon known as a moon-ring formation cycle. In that cycle, Mars pulled its moon so close that the moon got ripped apart, forming a giant ring. Then over time, the pieces of space dust and rock in the ring came together to reform a moon. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories .

Deimos's orbit, meanwhile, is tilted by about two degrees.
