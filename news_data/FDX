Unexpected costs and bottlenecks in charging infrastructure, fleet operations and maintenance, and permitting and financing weigh on cities and states mandating electric bus fleets, or private companies with large-scale delivery truck electrification goals. Solving for this “total cost of electrification” equation will be a critical step in pushing EV trucks and buses from the margins to the mainstream in the coming decade, according to a report released Wednesday by Environmental Defense Fund, MJ Bradley and Vivid Economics. “We’re seeing the technology increasingly ready, and capital increasingly eager to invest in sustainability” via fleet electrification, Andy Darrell, EDF’s chief of global energy and finance strategy, said in an interview. “And yet the deployment, especially in the medium and heavy-duty sector, might not be moving as quickly as we’d like to achieve big climate goals.” Estimates on the global market for electric trucks and buses range into the tens of billions of dollars over the coming decade, he noted.",FDX,en,Green Technology Media

Under the initiative, which kicks off Monday, Warrendale, Pennsylvania-based ShipMatrix will connect its universe of large shippers and third-party logistics (3PL) providers to the USPS' vast transportation infrastructure in an effort to assure capacity for all parcel users during the peak period. The program, called ShipMatrix First Class Parcel Service, will be available to e-commerce shippers using USPS' door-to-door delivery products such as its First Class Parcel Service (FCPS) and Priority Mail, ShipMatrix said. USPS manages the entire delivery process for both products. The new program will focus on small, lightweight parcels that can be placed inside mailboxes, where USPS has a monopoly.

By August the parcel had not been delivered. In September Parcel Hero emailed me to say my friend in Cairo had refused to pay an additional £390 in “duties” and therefore it had not been delivered.

With at-home tests, people self-collect their samples and send them back to the testing company for analysis. Several companies are developing tests that can work fully at home without shipping and lab equipment involved, but they haven't received the FDA's go-ahead yet. Still, ordering a test from the comfort of home can be appealing. It not only avoids run-ins with the physical healthcare system, saving time, but also reduces the risk of spreading the virus or getting infected yourself. Lab giant Quest Diagnostics has sold about half a million home tests, though that number includes self-collected samples taken in drive-thrus, the company told Business Insider in October.

It's not for lack of trying, lots of really smart companies working hard, but we couldn't find a vehicle that suited our need,” said Rachey, director of global fleet and product logistics for Amazon. The existing models didn’t live up to Amazon’s range and payload demands. And if the company’s fleet team did find something they liked, they couldn’t purchase it in the quantities they needed.

Former Uber driver Thomas Liu, from San Diego, filed the class-action lawsuit over his dismissal from the company in 2015. He was fired because riders gave him unfair app ratings because of his race, his lawsuit claimed. Uber customers can rate drivers on a one-to-five-star scale after each ride. To stay working for Uber, drivers must meet a minimum average rating — when Liu was dismissed in 2015, the required rating in San Diego was 4.6.

Items that are in stock are now able to be shipped from a network of close to 300 stores across the United States and Canada, and Apple told staff members that this will allow the company to offer faster delivery times for customers who live closer to stores than the distribution centers. The move to shipping from stores has been popularized by some grocery stores in recent years and has expanded to other retailers. The practice reduces costs, potentially improving product margins, and is beneficial to the environment, Apple told its staff. Depending on what's purchased, some orders will be delivered as soon as a day after a customer places an order, with Apple planning to ship through FedEx in the United States and United Parcel Service in Canada.",FDX,en,Mac Rumors

2020-10-08 12:50:37-05:00,A 100-year-old stock indicator just flashed a bullish signal suggesting further market upside,"Summary List Placement Dow Theory — a financial theory named after the father of technical analysis, Charles Dow — just flashed a bullish signal suggesting more upside ahead for the broader stock market. The theory is based on the relative price action of the Dow Jones industrial average and the Dow Jones Transportation Index, as traders look for a move in one to be confirmed by a move in the other. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Transportation Index closed at record all-time highs, which, according to the theory, would suggest that the Dow Jones industrial average will soon follow. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . Following the death of Charles Dow in 1902, hundreds of his editorials published in the Wall Street Journal (which he founded) were compiled and further expanded upon in a series of works. It ultimately garnered the name ""Dow Theory."" Coined by S.A. Nelson, and refined by William Hamilton and Robert Rhea, Dow Theory is the study of the intermarket relationship between the Dow Jones industrial average and the Dow Jones Rail Average (now called the Transportation Average).",FDX,en,Business Insider

But the past few months, Rickards hasn't been working for the Seattle-based megaretailer. Trucking rates have boomed this summer. The last week of August, research firm Cowen saw retailers and manufacturers paying 29% more on average in the spot market — where trucking loads are tendered on-demand, rather than through a contract. Rickards told Business Insider that he's been scoring loads with unusually high pay rates, like $6 a mile for a dry van load. And, from his experience, Amazon hasn't kept up with the uptick in pay. Amazon's rapidly-expanding transportation network depends on drivers like Rickards, whose company has only four trucks.

At issue is whether the TSA will recognize the security controls of e-commerce fulfillment centers, warehouses and other shippers as sufficient rather than require them to pay costs associated with 100% screening of their air cargo shipments. In either case, shippers will face increased costs and responsibility for securing their export cargo. The debate could pit the likes of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT ), FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX ), United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS ), airlines and freight forwarders against each other over what qualifies as a level playing field.

They work by collecting samples from the nose or mouth. Then, they're shipped to laboratories, where a process called ""nucleic acid amplification"" finds the virus' genetic material. The hope of at-home testing is to get tests in the hands of people who might otherwise struggle to find tests ; rural areas and ZIP codes with more people of color tend to have less testing sites per capita. They cost anywhere from $0 to $150, and some of the companies accept funds from health savings accounts. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . Among the hundreds of tests out there for the novel coronavirus, just a handful have received emergency authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration to ship them to people's homes.

My first venture back into the skies was on June 2, when I flew from Hartford, Connecticut, to Atlanta.

The additional Boeing 767 freighters will expand Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) fleet beyond 80 aircraft by the end of 2021, and a new report from researchers at DePaul University in Chicago estimates Amazon Air could have about 200 aircraft at its disposal in seven to eight years. Amazon Air now operates almost 100 flights per day despite focusing primarily on North America, it said. Having an air network to complement its ubiquitous ground-based shipping network allows the company to better control price and performance for overnight and two-day delivery promised to 105 million Prime members, and move inventory between fulfillment centers.

Not only is there a push for single-occupancy vehicles , public health officials warned that car-pooling and pooled ride-hailing could be just as dangerous, eroding decades of work to ease congestion and pollution on America's clogged highways.

When Shyp started out in 2013, it catered to consumers who wanted to avoid schlepping to the post office. Instead, they could snap a photo of items they needed to be shipped with their smartphone, whereupon a Shyp courier would pick up the goods and take them to a Shyp warehouse for packing and handoff to UPS, FedEx, or the USPS.

USPS has been raising its last-mile delivery rates for several years, and any dramatic escalation at this time could drive business to rivals FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX ) and UPS Inc. (NYSE: UPS ), and compel Amazon.com Inc., (NASDAQ: AMZN ) USPS' largest shipper, to shift more deliveries into its own network, experts have said. Should the Postal Regulatory Commission, which by law signs off on USPS' mail and parcel rate actions, agree to President Donald Trump's demands that the agency quadruple its delivery prices, about three-quarters of Amazon's business with USPS would likely disappear, according to Satish Jindel, head of consultancy ShipMatrix.

If you've been holding on to an unwanted item purchased in-store or online just before retailers temporarily closed brick-and-mortar locations or suspended e-commerce transactions, you're in luck. Most have extended their standard return window to accommodate customers who've been sheltering in place for weeks. But the trends aren't all favorable for consumers: Big-box retailers such as Costco and Walmart have temporarily discontinued returns for select household items -- including paper products and cleaning supplies -- due to health and safety concerns. And due to the increased volume of returns and e-commerce activity in general, it may take retailers longer than usual to process refunds, says consumer-savings expert Andrea Woroch. For purchases that need to be returned by mail, the United States Postal Service remains open, as do major shipping outlets such as UPS and FedEx.

Once teams figure out the basics of videoconferencing and chatting from home, Levie anticipates a second wave as they take the rest of their work online. “Phase two is: ‘Now that I’ve settled into this way of working, I need easy ways to collaborate with my partners, I need to be able to ship data around, I need to digitize certain businesses’ processes,'” Levie says. “That’s obviously where we play.” To capitalize on the next wave, Box has just released a public beta for a major website redesign—the last one was in 2016 —along with several new ways to manage files online.

Trump has frequently complained that Amazon and other online retailers are taking advantage of the USPS through below-market shipping rates. The president said he's considering using $10 billion in emergency coronavirus aid as leverage to exert more control over the cash-strapped USPS, suggesting it should quadruple its prices. Logistics experts have said Amazon benefits significantly from the USPS, but raising rates could also make it more difficult for the postal service to compete with shipping companies, hurting their financial state in the long run. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . President Donald Trump revisited his complaint that Amazon is responsible for the US Postal Service's financial challenges during a press conference Friday, while also suggesting the USPS should let the company handle its own shipping. ""If [the USPS] raise the price of a package like they should — four or five times, that's what it should be — or let Amazon build their own post office, which would be an impossible thing to do because the post office is massive and serves every little piece of the country… it would be a whole new ball game,"" Trump said.",FDX,en,Business Insider

Top Trump administration officials are considering requiring the Postal Service to charge higher rates on its package delivery services and weaken the authority of powerful postal service unions. None of these concessions are finalized, however, since the Postal Service has not officially asked for the $10 billion loan included in the CARES Act.

We've been pushing them [USPS] now for over a year."" However, USPS has for years been raising its prices on shipping and package delivery services as demand has increased along with the growth of e-commerce. The 2020 increases ranged from a little more than 2% for USPS Parcel Select service, in which big shippers place bulk consignments deep into the postal network for last-mile deliveries, to a little more than 4% for Priority Mail, which USPS handles on an end-to-end basis and which, unlike Parcel Select, has tight on-time guarantees. In 2019, USPS hiked rates on those same products by high single-digit to low double-digit levels. Ironically, USPS eased off on the pace of rate hikes in 2020 partly because of concerns it might be pricing itself out of the market vis-a-vis its competitors, which are the same companies that use it for Parcel Select.",FDX,en,Benzinga Feeds

These reassuring figures give hope that a similar rebound may occur in the rest of the world, especially in Europe which is the new coronavirus epicenter.

Click here for more BI Prime stories . Age-old investing folklore says that risk and return are inextricably linked. If you want a higher return, you have to take more risk. An investor can't have one without the other. But Gerry Frigon , the founder and chief investment officer of the $230 million Taylor Frigon Capital Management , doesn't adhere to that school of thought — and he's found a way to play high-growth trends with less traditional risk exposure. ""It's difficult to fill a complete portfolio with nothing but that kind of stuff,"" he said in an exclusive interview with Business Insider. ""It's not everyday that you come across something that has attributes to it that are tied to a particular narrative that's important — but doesn't have the same level of risk because it's an enabler."" That last bit is important — and it's a key theme of Frigon's investment thesis surrounding the biotechnology space.","FB,FDX",en,Business Insider

It was the 13th month in a row of year-over-year declines, and the steepest year-over-year decline since November 2009, during the Financial Crisis: The Cass Freight Index tracks shipment volume of consumer goods and industrial products and supplies by all modes of transportation, but it does not track bulk commodities, such as grains. As always when things get ugly, the calendar gets blamed – Christmas fell on a Wednesday, as it does regularly. More realistically, December was also the month when Celadon Group, with about 3,000 drivers and about 2,700 tractors, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and ceased operations — the largest truckload carrier ever to file for bankruptcy in US history .",FDX,en,Zero Hedge

The ban, imposed Dec. 16 and lifted at 5 p.m. EST Tuesday, specifically affected businesses enrolled in Amazon's Seller-Fulfilled Prime (SFP) program. Under the program, merchants can use any fulfillment provider and still keep their status to sell under Amazon's coveted Prime designation. However, the provider must meet delivery performance standards set by Amazon. Should the provider fall below specific performance measures, the merchant will eventually switch to another provider or lose its Prime designation, which can mean thousands if not millions of dollars in revenue.

Among the challenges for logistics companies is that consumer delivery is a much more expensive proposition than business-to-business fulfillment, largely because last-mile delivery networks aren't nearly as dense.

Analysts acknowledged its dilemma in a changing delivery sector, but some saw FedEx's woes as having bottomed out, with a return to a package of better performance about to knock on the front door. Analysts put the blame on FedEx's continuing struggles in the new world of e-commerce. Providing quicker shipping on more days is expensive, it turns out. FedEx acknowledged it underestimated the cost to expand to seven-day delivery and now is also dealing with Amazon.com, Inc . (NASDAQ: AMZN ) as a competitor, rather than as a customer. It's also still trying to integrate acquired European courier TNT Express. The Analysts Morgan Stanley's Ravi Shanker kept an Equal-Weight rating on the stock but lowered the target price from $111 to $109. Wells Fargo's Allison Poliniak-Cusic continues to have an Overweight rating on FedEx, but lowered the price target from $189 to $183 while lowering earnings estimates.",FDX,en,Benzinga

""To be fair the market was braced for a weak result…but we’d characterize these numbers as weaker than even the most bearish estimates"", Mehrotra wrote, adding that "" earnings appear to be in free-fall, with seemingly little clarity being provided by management as to the duration of the current downturn and drivers of recovery."" However the real reason why Wall Street is angry, is because FedEx became the latest confirmation that there is something disastrously wrong with the recovery narrative , the same one that has pushed stocks to all time highs even as critical names such as Fedex, which are a leading indicator of global trade and commerce, remain in free fall.",FDX,en,Zero Hedge

Indeed, the prevalence of these porch pirates is part of the reason why tens of thousands of packages go missing in New York City alone every single day, according to The New York Times , and it's why people keep taking certain steps like directing their holiday deliveries to their office address, instead, which brings its own challenges. This is also why Mark Rober, a former NASA engineer who worked on the Curiosity Rover (and who’s now a viral sensation on YouTube ) is back with a Home Alone -inspired booby trap meant to catch and deter these would-be thieves.

2019-11-11 10:08:20-05:00,Regional Parcel Carriers Hope E-Commerce Will Boost Share Of Shippers' Wallets,"Regional carriers have much to offer parcel shippers, especially those looking to break some of their bonds with FedEx Corp . (NYSE: FDX ) and UPS Inc . (NYSE: UPS ). The regionals can deliver fast and reliably because of their tight coverage areas. Their cost to serve can be lower because they don't have the overhead of the big guys. They can be more nimble and provide personalized service that big organizations, with their size and accompanying bureaucracies, often can't match. Kim Brown, vice president of brand supply chain and global logistics at Quality Bicycle Products, the nation's largest wholesale distributor of bicycle parts and accessories, describes her relationships with her regional carrier reps as ""warm and welcoming."" Brown, who uses regionals throughout the U.S., doesn't speak in such lofty terms about her big-parcel reps. The setup of today's parcel shipping marketplace, with its emphasis on low-cost, short-haul, next-day delivery services of up to 500 miles, all triggered by the e-commerce tsunami, augurs well for regionals that have shifted their delivery models to business-to-consumer (B2C) from the business-to-business (B2B) services that all parcel carriers grew up in.",FDX,en,Benzinga Feeds

FXG is a subsidiary of Memphis-based shipping and logistics giant FedEx Corp . (NYSE: FDX ). Court documents allege that Leonid Teyf, 58, of Raleigh, North Carolina, and the other executives paid more than $1 million in bribes to former FedEx Ground hub manager Ryan Lee Mower, 47, of Bountiful, Utah, in exchange for lucrative contracts. Prosecutors claim the trucking companies involved in the scheme with Mower raked in more than $280 million over a 10-year period, though FedEx Ground put that sum in context. ""The vast majority of this money was payment for work that was actually performed,"" said Meredith Miller, FedEx Ground spokeswoman. ""Therefore, because FedEx Ground would have paid to have that work performed in any event, the net financial loss to FedEx Ground is a small fraction of this amount and is not material."" FedEx Ground contracts with 5,600 service providers throughout the United States and Canada, according to the company's website.

By October of that year, he’d found it: a $9.4 billion plan to buy Rite Aid Corp. that would have vaulted Walgreens past CVS Health Corp. to become by far the largest U.S. drugstore chain. But after he spent almost two years wooing government officials and investors, regulators prevented Walgreens from swallowing Rite Aid. In September 2017, Pessina had to settle for buying 1,932 Rite Aid stores, less than half as many as his original target. As it turns out, that might have spared Walgreens an even more painful reckoning than the one it now faces. On April 2 shares of the company plummeted 13 percent after it said earnings would be stagnant for the rest of its fiscal year, which ends on Aug. 31. Pessina, who owns 15.9 percent of Walgreens shares, lost $1.2 billion of his personal wealth in one day; the stock’s total decline since his Britain-centered Alliance Boots drugstore chain merged with the U.S.-based chain has reached 28 percent.",FDX,en,Bloomberg

To learn more about Business Insider Intelligence, click here . Current subscribers can read the report here . Outside of the US Postal Service (USPS), FedEx and UPS have dominated the domestic logistics industry — and in particular, the last-mile of the delivery — for decades. On a quarterly earnings call in 2016, FedEx estimated that itself, UPS, and USPS executed a whopping 95% of all e-commerce orders. But rapidly rising volumes have put the pair of legacy shippers in a bind. E-commerce sales have risen over 50% and are projected to continue their ascent into the next decade. High volumes are already straining shippers' networks — UPS struggled to bring consumers their parcels on time due to higher-than-anticipated package volume, which upset some big-name retail partners, including Macy's, Walmart, and Amazon. As online sales surge further, package volumes will outstrip legacy shippers' capacities, creating space for new entrants.",FDX,en,Business Insider

The parcel-delivery company, historically a laggard in Europe relative to rival United Parcel Service Inc., bet big on the region in 2016 with the $4.4 billion acquisition of Netherlands-based TNT Express NV. Three years later, FedEx is still trying to integrate TNT into its operations. Two veteran executives leading that process have been replaced, and sluggish growth abroad is weighing on FedEx’s results. On March 19, the company cut its fiscal 2019 earnings guidance for the second time in only three months and said it may need to take more drastic cost-cutting actions to mitigate the impact of weak international sales. “We remain confident in the long-term strategic value of the FedEx Express/TNT Express combination,” Rajesh Subramaniam, FedEx’s president and chief operating officer, said in a press release.
