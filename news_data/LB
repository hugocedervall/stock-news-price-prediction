The company provided a longer-term goal for the brand to achieve 10-15% operating margins. BofA Stays Sidelined The margin goal is unrealistic given changes in store productivity and the online mix, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Lorraine Hutchinson said in a Wednesday note. BofA has a year-end operating margin forecast of 3.6% for Victoria’s Secret. Marketing evolution will determine future growth, with a significant focus on improving Victoria’s Secret and Pink’s marketing to drive a positive sales inflection, the analyst said. “It is too early to tell if recent marketing changes will move the needle and we view the brand’s strategy to reduce choice count by 50% for holiday as very risky.” Although Hutchinson acknowledged the company is working hard to change course, she maintained a Neutral rating on the stock with a $22 price target.
