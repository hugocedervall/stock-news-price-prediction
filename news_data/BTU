Thomas Gaynor and Jinjian Huang in San Francisco, Stephen Reil in Los Angeles, Maria Swiatek in Silicon Valley and Abigail Reardon in New York said Nixon has refused to pay the wages, equity distributions, or capital account balances they were entitled to after they decided to move to DLA. The amount is in the millions of dollars, their suit said. Nixon Peabody, meanwhile, claims the group must pay back at least $174,000 in bonuses that they earned in 2018 and were paid in early 2019, according to arbitration papers filed with the lawsuit. The former partners said Nixon is wrong to demand their bonuses back and want a judge to halt the arbitration.

2020-09-08 02:00:00-05:00,Winners and Losers of BlackRock’s Climate Pushback (So Far),"In January, the world's largest asset manager issued a warning shot that the status quo on climate change is not going to cut it. In his annual letter, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink wrote: “We don’t yet know which predictions about the climate will be most accurate, nor what effects we have failed to consider. But there is no denying the direction we are heading. Every government, company, and shareholder must confront climate change.” With more than $6 trillion of investments under management and influence in boardrooms of nearly 1,800 companies, what BlackRock says carries big weight across the corporate and political world. But that weight only hits home if BlackRock follows through and presses for a response to climate change in boardrooms. Among its specific pledges, BlackRock said it will divest from companies deriving 25 percent or more of their revenue from thermal coal, and press companies to make climate and sustainability disclosures aligned with Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).",BTU,en,Green Technology Media

With countries rightly phasing coal out of their energy mix, the GWPF has turned its sights on Africa to peddle its misinformation about the merits of burning fossil fuels. It has published a new report, derisively titled Heart of Darkness: Why Electricity for Africa is a Security Issue , and launched a glossy website for “energy justice”, which uses the language of climate justice campaigners to try to undermine renewable energy.
