The company undertook steps to restructure its operations in Canada, announcing that it is committed to its operations in Canada despite plans to close 34 stores in the next, fourth quarter. They also invested in updating its online business and enhancing their focus on targeting professional contractors- a segment that is ruled by its rival The Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD ).

2019-03-26 00:22:52-05:00,"AUD/USD Technical Analysis: Falling wedge breakout confirmed, but risk-off may play spoil sport","AUD/USD closed yesterday at 0.7112, confirming a falling wedge breakout on the daily chart. While the bear-to-bull trend change has opened the doors to 0.72, the gains may remain elusive if the treasury yield curve inversion and the resulting recession fears continue to keep risk assets on the defensive. That said, the breakout is backed by the 14-day relative strength index's (RSIs) bullish break above 50.00. So, the probability of the AUD rising to 0.72 looks strong. The bullish case, however, would weak if potential risk-off sends the pair below 0.7065 (Monday's low). Daily chart Trend: Cautiously bullish",LOW,en,FXStreet

It may not be a big surprise to see the stock sell off ahead of results--it has tumbled 14.3% this month (the S&P 500 has gained 1.6%). The stock has plunged on the day of the past five earnings reports, by an average of 13.1%. Even though some analysts said $33 million fine levied this week on the company, for making fraudulent statements to investors regarding unsafe flooring sourced from China, removes the last major legal overhand, Wall Street remains unanimously cautious, with all 8 analysts surveyed by FactSet rating the company the equivalent of ""hold."" Wedbush's Budd Bugatch said in a recent note that he's encouraged by the legal progress, there's still uncertainty regarding the underlying store operating model, the lack of resolution of the China tariffs and increasing competition from Home Depot Inc. , Lowe's Companies and Floor & Decor Holdings Inc. .","LOW,LL",en,MarketWatch
