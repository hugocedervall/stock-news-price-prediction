2020-12-02 19:54:38-05:00,"Republican Sen. David Perdue's stock portfolio shows he'd occasionally make at least 20 trades in one day, per a New York Times investigation","Summary List Placement Republican Sen. David Perdue has occasionally made at least 20 stock transactions in just one day, according to a New York Times analysis on Wednesday. The report revealed that during his six years in office, Perdue carried out 2,596 trades, which makes up almost a third of all trades by senators over the same time period. Sometimes, that meant Perdue made 20 or more transactions in the span of a day, The Times noted. The data comes as Perdue has faced public scrutiny over the past several months for potential conflicts of interest while stock trading as a member of Congress. He drew criticism in the spring after the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that he bought stock in a personal protective equipment company on January 24 — the same day he received a classified Senate briefing on the coronavirus. (The Times reported last week that the Justice Department had been investigating the senator's stock activity around the start of the pandemic; that investigation was dropped without charges.)

The bank's chief US equity strategist and chief investment officer said in a Monday note that he expects the market to drop another 10% in the near term as investors face uncertainty around the election outcome, more fiscal stimulus, and another wave of COVID-19. But once the dust settles, Wilson said he expects the bull market to ensue — one which will be led by cyclical and smaller-cap stocks as earnings get a boost from the economic recovery. As such, Wilson recommended using a near term sell-off as a buying opportunity. ""We think the best opportunities lie in stocks where earnings are growing with the cyclical rebound and growing by enough to offset any valuation headwinds,"" Wilson said.
