Here's how they work and where to order one.,"Summary List Placement Among the hundreds of tests out there for the novel coronavirus, just a handful have received emergency authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration to ship them to people's homes. With at-home tests, people self-collect their samples and send them back to the testing company for analysis. Several companies are developing tests that can work fully at home without shipping and lab equipment involved, but they haven't received the FDA's go-ahead yet. Still, ordering a test from the comfort of home can be appealing. It not only avoids run-ins with the physical healthcare system, saving time, but also reduces the risk of spreading the virus or getting infected yourself. Lab giant Quest Diagnostics has sold about half a million home tests, though that number includes self-collected samples taken in drive-thrus, the company told Business Insider in October.

They work by collecting samples from the nose or mouth. Then, they're shipped to laboratories, where a process called ""nucleic acid amplification"" finds the virus' genetic material. The hope of at-home testing is to get tests in the hands of people who might otherwise struggle to find tests ; rural areas and ZIP codes with more people of color tend to have less testing sites per capita. They cost anywhere from $0 to $150, and some of the companies accept funds from health savings accounts. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . Among the hundreds of tests out there for the novel coronavirus, just a handful have received emergency authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration to ship them to people's homes. With at-home tests, people self-collect their samples and ship them back to the testing company for analysis. Many of the companies have their own labs and tests, or partner with other groups to run the samples, according to the FDA and Business Insider's reporting.",PKI,en,Business Insider
