(NASDAQ: FB ), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) results could help shape Friday’s market, though lately, earnings news has taken a back seat to worries about rising virus cases, the election, and lack of a fiscal stimulus. This is shaping up as the worst week for stocks since March. There’s a lot more below on what to expect from the FAANGs going into this climactic afternoon (see below chart), but to start things off, there’s some housekeeping as we sort through the morning’s data deluge. First, gross domestic product (GDP) for Q3 came in at a 33.1% seasonally adjusted rate. That was a bit better than the 30.2% analysts had expected, and seemed to put a charge back into stock futures an hour ahead of the open. By comparison, Q2 GDP fell 31.4%.

As JPM's equity strategist Misla Matejka writes in his weekly Equity Strategy notes, ""at the global equity level, we remain constructive"" and while the JPM analyst acknowledges that ""the latest health scare is likely to worsen before getting better, which could lead to more significant near term derisking"" he notes that ""past outbreaks have tended to drive only limited market falls."" In summary, Matejka is so confident that the virus sell-off over the coronavirus pandemic, whose full proportions and damage remain largely unknown, says that "" health scares, similar to the localised war campaigns, as well as the terrorist incidents, were historically buying opportunities, rather than the reasons for sustained selling ."" To ""validate"" its optimism, JPMorgan looks at the last two decades, and finds four pandemics which posed a global health risk, noting that ""each of these caused a significant number of deaths and impacted economic activity in the affected region.""
