2020-02-15 17:30:00-05:00,The Gold-Silver Ratio,"The Gold-Silver Ratio Authored by 'mickeyman' via The World Complex blog, A couple of weeks ago, Wheaton Precious Metals released a very useful study on the gold-silver ratio. Today I would like to take a look at some of its implications. The most important implication is one that everyone needs a little time to absorb. That is that there is no characteristic value for the gold-silver ratio (GSR). That means that there is no ""true north"", or no mythic value (16, for instance) to which it is attracted, and to which it would return if only the world stopped manipulating its price. The Wheaton conclusions are quite definite. The gold-silver rises during deflationary periods and disinflationary periods (we'll look at this distinction shortly). The gold-silver ratio falls during inflationary periods. What is unclear is whether a rising GSR causes deflation, or deflation causes a rising GSR. I know which one I believe. Let's test this against some measures I've used for deflation/inflation. ",WPM,en,Zero Hedge
