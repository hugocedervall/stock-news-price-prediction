Subscribe today to receive industry-changing payments and commerce news and analysis to your inbox. In the US, the in-store mobile wallet space is becoming increasingly crowded. Most customers have an option provided by their smartphone vendor, like Apple, Android, or Samsung Pay. But those are often supplemented by a myriad of options from other players, ranging from tech firms like PayPal, to banks and card issuers, to major retailers and restaurants. With that proliferation of options, one would expect to see a surge in adoption.

To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here. Green Dot has reported earnings for Q2, revealing that it saw a year-over-year (YoY) loss of around 500,000 active prepaid accounts due to lower unit sales of prepared products, although this was offset by an increase in active banking-as-a-service accounts of approximately 240,000, CFO Mark Shifke said in an earnings call . However, the bank also saw overall spend volume rise 2% annually despite the lower account total — a fact it takes as progress toward drawing a more committed customer base, Green Dot Founder, President, CEO, and Director Steven Streit said in the call. Green Dot believes stiffer competition from neobanks is hurting its customer acquisition attempts. Streit said he believes that aggregate marketing spend from many competitiors is taking a toll on its new customer acquisition.

The move, which is said to be a precautionary measure to protect the economy from a downturn, will bring interest rates down to between 2% and 2.25%. The interest rate cuts are expected to work in favor of loan borrowers in particular. People with credit card debt, private student loans, certain auto loans, small business loans, or home equity lines of credit are largely expected to benefit from the decline in interest rates. But high-yield savings account providers, particularly digital-only banks, could face headwinds due to the drop in interest rates. Interest rates were reduced to nearly zero after the financial crisis, which has impacted major banks. The interest rate cuts in 2008 have left little incentive for consumers to hold savings accounts with major banks.",GDOT,en,Business Insider
