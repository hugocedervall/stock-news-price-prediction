2020-05-05 14:13:26-05:00,Barge Giant Kirby: Signs Of Life But Too Soon To Call Bottom,"It's a strange time for public reporting. Companies are posting results for a period – January to March – that's largely irrelevant because it pre-dated peak COVID-19 fallout. The value of this round of quarterly reporting is in commentary on current conditions, particularly from bigger public players who can provide front-line insights on the U.S. economy. One of those bigger players is Kirby Corporation (NYSE: KEX ), the largest owner of inland tank barges in America and by far the largest listed vessel owner measured by market capitalization (at $3 billion). Before the market opened on Tuesday, Kirby reported a net loss of $248.5 million for the first quarter of 2020 compared to net income of $44.3 million in the same period last year. However, Kirby reported a $334.6 million after-tax write-down of its non-maritime distribution and services segment, which serves oil and gas customers. Excluding non-cash items, Kirby reported adjusted net income of $35.3 million or $0.59 per share, above the analyst consensus forecast for adjusted earnings of $0.44 per share.",KEX,en,Benzinga Feeds

According to Kirby CEO David Grzebinski, ""Our utilization levels have been in the 95% range in recent weeks. This morning we were 97% utilized, which frankly is as busy as I've ever seen it.
