Microsoft had been seen as the American technology company with the deepest pockets to buy TikTok’s U.S. operations from its parent company, ByteDance, and with the greatest ability to address national security concerns that led to Trump’s order.“ByteDance let us know today they would not be selling TikTok’s U.S. operations to Microsoft,” Microsoft said in a statement. “We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok’s users, while protecting national security interests.”ByteDance declined to comment.",KKR,en,Economic Times India

A flurry of dealmaking involving his $176 billion oil-to-telecom giant Reliance Industries could make that a sharper reality by seriously blunting the competition. Ambani’s Reliance Retail is a conglomerate within a conglomerate, accounting for one quarter of group revenue last year. It has joint ventures with luxury labels from Tiffany & Co to Jimmy Choo, and owns Trends, a mass-market chain. In groceries, it operates supermarkets plus a cash-and-carry business catering to tiny shops. The unit is also a big owner of electronics stores, petrol pump retail outlets, and so-called Jio Points which function as sales counters for Ambani’s mobile operator. Overall, it’s the country’s largest retailer by reach, scale, revenue and profitability with almost 12,000 stores covering 28.7 million square feet. Ambani reminded shareholders last year that the business is “four times larger than the second largest retail player” and “larger than all the other major retailers put together”.",KKR,en,Reuters

Discussions of a ban have been coupled with reports that Microsoft or other companies may potentially buy the U.S. operations of the app.So what gives? Here’s a primer on how the app became embroiled with the White House and on the deal talks.What is the issue with TikTok?It all starts with two factors. One is that TikTok is owned by a Chinese internet company, ByteDance.

2020-07-14 14:49:24-05:00,Distressed-debt investor Jason Mudrick says the 'sheer size' of this distress cycle is unprecedented. Here are the opportunities he's eyeing.,"Jason Mudrick believes he's going to be very busy over the next three-to-five years — the distressed investing expert sees trillions in opportunities, and he said it's only the ""first inning"" of the cycle. Mudrick, whose eponymous firm runs $2.4 billion, said on a webinar hosted by Anthony Scaramucci's Skybridge Capital Tuesday that companies that service travel industries — like airline internet services — are clear examples of potential opportunities. While the long-running bull market hurt many distress investors, Mudrick believes his firm's relatively smaller size helped them find opportunities in smaller companies when there weren't many in the market. Still, he's glad there's more fish in the sea — ""if you would ask me if I'd rather have a bull market or a lot to do, I'd say a lot to do."" Sign up here for our Wall Street Insider newsletter. Distress investors — those specializing in buying companies in bankruptcy or close to it, and reorganizing them — are excited about the opportunities that have come from the novel coronavirus pandemic, and Jason Mudrick is no different.",KKR,en,Business Insider

And, like Zoom, JioMeet offers screen sharing and collaboration tools, support for up to 100 video call participants, and meeting encryption (though it is unclear whether JioMeet matches Zoom's end-to-end encryption standard ). And whereas Zoom employs a freemium model in which free users are subjected to pain points such as a 40-minute limit on some group meetings, JioMeet is completely free and will host meetings for up to 24 hours straight.

He overtook Larry Ellison of Oracle Corp. and France’s Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, the wealthiest woman, to reach the No. 9 spot.Ambani, who owns 42% of Reliance, has benefited from a flurry of investment into the company’s digital unit, Jio Platforms Ltd., that Reliance said has made it net-debt free ahead of a March 2021 target. The shares of the Indian conglomerate have doubled from a low in March, just as other billionaires on the list have been hit by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.While the Indian economy “has been nearly decimated” during the lockdown to control the spread of Covid-19, “Mr. Ambani’s companies (particularly the telecom giant Jio) have prospered, and his personal wealth has increased substantially,” said Jayati Ghosh, chair of the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning at the Jawaharlal Nehru University.A media representative for Reliance declined to comment on Ambani’s fortune.The rise of the 63-year-old as India heads for its worst-ever recession is a reminder of the nation’s deep economic divide, in which the top 10% hold more than three-quarters of the total wealth, and where most new fortune creation stays in the hands of the richest 1%.",KKR,en,Economic Times India

The stock surged Thursday in Mumbai after Reuters reported Amazon.com Inc. was in early talks to buy a stake of at least $2 billion.The comeback is a sharp turnaround for billionaire Sunil Mittal after grueling competition with Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. knocked Airtel off its perch in the world’s second-biggest wireless market by users.

Another rival -- Vodafone Idea Ltd. -- is struggling to survive under a pile of debt.“The market assumed Bharti Airtel would take months to recover from the onslaught of Reliance Jio,” said Arun Kejriwal, director at KRIS, an investment advisory firm in Mumbai. “But they raised funds from the market and have moved quickly to take advantage of the duopolistic nature of Indian telecom landscape.”Jio and former No. 1 Airtel have battled over India’s telecom market since 2016, when Ambani pushed his way in with a 4G service that offered free calls and cheap data packages.",KKR,en,Economic Times India

A $25-30 billion TARP-like programme can pull sectors like NBFCs out of distress,” Bain Capital Private Equity managing director Amit Chandra said.Others also backed one-time restructuring. “A weaker credit book business will be the result of the moratorium (for six months on loan repayments) as it gives time for the borrower, but it is not the solution; a one-time restructuring plan (is),” said Sanjay Nayar, the CEO of KKR India.",KKR,en,Economic Times India

Behind the scenes, however, the Treasury’s responsibilities have fallen largely to the 42-year-old deputy secretary, Justin Muzinich. A major beneficiary of that bailout so far: Muzinich & Co., the asset manager founded by his father where Justin served as president before joining the administration. He reported owning a stake worth at least $60 million when he entered government in 2017. Today, Muzinich retains financial ties to the firm through an opaque transaction in which he transferred his shares in the privately held company to his father.

Submitted By Karin Wasteson | 20/01/2020 - 12:20pm The first quarter of 2019 broke the all-time record for investment in Europe, with EUR7.3 billion invested (EUR8.3 billion including Israel), and according to a new study by e-front, the global venture capital industry hit an all-time high last year. Much of the vibrancy of the venture capital market at the moment is driven by the outstanding performance of European funds. We also see US investors coming over to Europe and sourcing venture deals over here to a larger extent than ever before. Octopus Ventures principal, Malcolm Ferguson, assesses new investment opportunities for the firm in London, as well as being a non-executive director of portfolio companies such as By Miles, DeadHappy and Sofar Sounds. And in his view, the fact that 2019 was another record year for deal volumes in European venture capital, especially in the UK, is driven mainly by the fact that there are more players and more funds in the market. “Funds are less generalist and more specialist today and investors are more informed,” said Ferguson.",KKR,en,privateequitywire.co.uk

America’s international oil companies and major think tank s and ‘charitable’ foundation s were also supportive and providing propaganda for the operation, but the main financing for it came from America’s taxpayers, and from the Saud family and from the Government that they own. One of the best articles that the New York Times ever published was by Mark Mazzetti and Matt Apuzzo, on 23 January 2016, ""US Relies Heavily on Saudi Money to Support Syrian Rebels” .
