2020-11-11 07:36:39-05:00,US utilities follow a “shift to safety” strategy,"In recent years, many US utilities have begun to follow a ""shift to safety"" strategy by rapidly shifting shares of capital spending away from competitive ventures and toward safer, state-regulated utility projects. Between 2016 and 2019, capital spending on state-regulated utility projects increased 10.5% per year, while utility capital spending on nonutility projects fell 6.5% per year (see Figure 1). The trend toward safety is likely to continue, as major announcements in 2020 from Avangrid (PNM Resources acquisition), DTE Energy (plans to spin-off midstream natural gas business) and PSEG (plans to divest nonnuclear competitive generation) all reflect an increase in strategic emphasis on regulated electric and gas utility operations.
