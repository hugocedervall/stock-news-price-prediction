With S&P futures sliding 0.5%, and European and Asian markets sliding, it is a day of reversals in global markets as the new-year rally has stalled, while the dollar rebounded and oil dropping for the first time in two weeks. Today's decline follows four consecutive daily gains for the S&P 500 which is something the index hasn’t seen since September, and the rally of +5.60% over that stretch is the best such four-day performance since August 2015. Buying continued to be broad based, with 68% of S&P 500 companies advancing, though equities did fade off their intraday highs as acrimony between President Trump and Congressional Democrats intensified.",SNX,en,Zero Hedge
