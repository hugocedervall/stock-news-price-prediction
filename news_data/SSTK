The United Nations' International Maritime Organization (IMO) implemented its low-sulfur fuel mandate on January 1, 2020. Full enforcement begins in earnest on March 1. Referred to as IMO 2020, it updates Annex VI of the MARPOL (or Marine Pollution Treaty of 1973). Annex VI covers a variety of airborne pollutants from vessels. Local jurisdictions, however, have the option to enforce even tighter standards. Thus, IMO 2020, as a minimum standard, applies to international waters. (Photo credit: Shutterstock) The scale of the pollution problem is highlighted in a 2018 study by Goldman Sachs. The marine sector is responsible for 90% of the sulfur-dioxide generated by all modes of transportation. Just 15 of the world's largest ocean vessels generate more sulfur-dioxide than all the automobiles in the world.

This first phase was signed by both parties on January 15th. The agreement was billed as the first phase of a broader trade pact between the U.S. and China, but many were still left wondering if the Trump Administration is completely finished with its attempts to rewrite the trade relationship with China. Critics of the agreement were also quick to point out some key points that the trade agreement was missing. Many claimed the agreement did not sufficiently address key U.S. accusations against China for what has been labeled as state-backed hacking of American companies and government institutions, nor did it require China to curtail its state subsidies that have been a driving force in the rapid growth of China's unique form of capitalism – as well as funding many Chinese multinational corporations.",SSTK,en,Benzinga Feeds
