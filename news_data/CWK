2020-12-06 03:01:43-05:00,Net office absorption seen at 31 million sq ft in 2021,"MUMBAI: Net absorption of office space in 2021 is expected to be at par with the last 10 years average of 30-31 million sq ft in India despite the challenges created by the ongoing pandemic, said property consultants.The emergence of the Work-from-Home model given the lockdowns and safety of employees has impacted the demand for office spaces as only a fraction of employees are coming to offices. However, the numbers are expected to improve with the access to the vaccine. “I am pleasantly surprised by the absorption. Honestly, I didn’t think that this calendar year will be 50-60% of 2019 absorption. In June, I would have said it would be between 16 to 19 million sq. ft, but now the net absorption is likely to be somewhere around 25 million sq. ft. It is surprising,"" said Anuj Puri, Chairman, Anarock Property Consultants.After the dip in net office absorption in the June-Septmber quarter, it started improving gradually. “In comparison to Q2, the absorption went up by 63%, but if we were to compare Q3 of the last year, the absorption went down by nearly 47%.",CWK,en,Economic Times India

Vornado co-owns an office tower in San Francisco and another in Manhattan and ""couldn't attract a buyer"" at the price it was seeking, according to an exclusive by The Wall Street Journal . It had hoped to raise $5 billion from the deleveraging in total, of which $1.5 billion would have made its way to The Trump Organization. Vornado Chief Executive Steven Roth had said this month there was ""active interest from investors"" for the deals . It looks as though the ""active interest"" may not have been at the right price, however.
