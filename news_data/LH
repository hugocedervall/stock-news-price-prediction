As cases climb in Europe, even Japan is starting to feel uneasy, as cases increase by 1,685 over the last 24 hours, a second straight daily high. In India, which has seen case numbers fall in recent weeks, the state of Delhi, home of the Indian capital New Delhi, has reported a record daily high of 104 new deaths and 7,053 new infections. Countrywide, deaths increased by 547 to 128,668 in the past 24 hours. Total infections, meanwhile, rose by 44,789. Tokyo reported 374 new infections, down slightly from 393 a day earlier, but the third consecutive day of more than 300 confirmed cases, adding to fears of a ""third wave"".

2019-04-17 05:00:32-05:00,Walgreens Could Use a Prescription for Ailing Drugstore Business,"(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- When billionaire Stefano Pessina took over as chief executive officer of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. in 2015, he soon began hunting for his next big deal. By October of that year, he’d found it: a $9.4 billion plan to buy Rite Aid Corp. that would have vaulted Walgreens past CVS Health Corp. to become by far the largest U.S. drugstore chain. But after he spent almost two years wooing government officials and investors, regulators prevented Walgreens from swallowing Rite Aid. In September 2017, Pessina had to settle for buying 1,932 Rite Aid stores, less than half as many as his original target. As it turns out, that might have spared Walgreens an even more painful reckoning than the one it now faces. On April 2 shares of the company plummeted 13 percent after it said earnings would be stagnant for the rest of its fiscal year, which ends on Aug. 31. Pessina, who owns 15.9 percent of Walgreens shares, lost $1.2 billion of his personal wealth in one day; the stock’s total decline since his Britain-centered Alliance Boots drugstore chain merged with the U.S.-based chain has reached 28 percent.",LH,en,Bloomberg
