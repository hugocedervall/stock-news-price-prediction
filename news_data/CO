2019-02-15 07:25:16-05:00,S&P Futures Reverse Overnight Losses As Disappointing Trade Talks Head To Washington,"After a lackluster start to global markets on the last day of the week following the conclusion of yet another indecisive round of trade talks between the US and China where nothing was resolved aside from reports of a possible MOU to lay out ""next steps"" in the ongoing negotiations, global markets rebounded as ye olde ""trade deal optimism"" returned after China's president said trade talks would continue in Washington DC next week (as if there was any other option with the March 1 deadline looming). This helped reverse overnight stock losses, with US equity futures jumping almost 20 points from session lows, just as Europe opened for trade, with the Stoxx 600 rising 0.8% on ""hope."" “Negotiations between both sides have achieved important progress in another step,” president Xi said after the 6th trade talks wrapped up in Beijing, quoted China’s Xinhua News Agency. “Next week, both sides are going to meet in Washington. I hope you keep up the good work, and push for a mutually-benefiting and win-win agreement.” Xi said he values the “good working relationship” with President Donald Trump very much, and is willing to keep in touch with him in various ways.","CO,CNY",en,Zero Hedge

Trading was initially choppy overnight as hopes of more stimulus measures from China to shore up economic growth clashed with worries over progress between Washington and Beijing to resolve a trade spat between the world’s top two economies. The MSCI world equity index was down 0.1 percent, with Asian equity markets choppy as the region attempted to shrug off the headwinds from the US, where stocks slumped on Tuesday as the risk averse tone and lingering global growth concerns caught up with the major US indices on return from their extended weekend. The FT reported that the US turned down China’s offer for preparatory trade talks, which was later denied by NEC Director Larry Kudlow helping U.S. equities pare some losses though the fresh concerns about U.S.-China relations kept share prices in check.",CO,en,Zero Hedge
