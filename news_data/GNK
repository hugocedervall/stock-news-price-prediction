The $2.9 billion merger of two of Canada’s biggest oil-sands players would reduce Li’s and CK Hutchison’s combined holdings in the new entity to 27%.By cutting their Husky stake, Li and his older son Victor -- the chairman of CK Hutchison -- are seeking to reduce the drag on the earnings at their group, which has been buffeted by the coronavirus pandemic. Shares of Calgary-based Husky have plunged more than 85% in the past 10 years, and the company has reported a total $3.3 billion of losses in the three quarters through June.“The proposed Husky merger will effectively reduce earnings volatility induced by the Canadian oil operation,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts led by Cusson Leung wrote in a note Monday. “This used to be the most cyclical element in CKH’s earnings.”Like many of its peers, Husky has been losing money following the crash in oil demand due to the pandemic.",GNK,en,Yahoo Finance

2020-04-20 14:45:35-05:00,Will Dry Bulk Remain The 'Wile E. Coyote' Of Ocean Shipping?,"Dry bulk has been the ""Wile E. Coyote"" of ocean shipping for the past decade – forever chasing after profits only to lunge at empty air and repeatedly fall straight off a cliff. Rates for Capesizes, the workhorse bulkers with capacity of around 180,000 deadweight tons, are now enjoying their seasonal upturn, but even so, they're still below breakeven. Will this be yet another lost year for dry bulk shipping, and for top U.S.-listed Capesize owners Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (NASDAQ: SBLK ), Golden Ocean Group Limited (NASDAQ: GOGL ) and Genco Shipping & Trading Limited (NYSE: GNK )? Evercore ISI analyst Jon Chappell is not optimistic on the sector's prospects. ""Dry bulk challenges will just not abate,"" he said in a client note on Monday. Dry bulk's lost decade Prior to 2009, vast fortunes were made in dry bulk, the largest cargo business in the world measured by volume and the freight segment with the most active derivatives market. According to Chappell, ""Since the end of the global financial crisis, a myriad of issues … have derailed the promise of another sustainable cyclical upturn, resulting in year after year of losses and ‘cheap' stocks.",GNK,en,Benzinga Feeds

2020-02-27 09:18:57-05:00,Is The Worst Still To Come For Dry Bulk Shipping?,"Not surprisingly, coronavirus is a major topic on the quarterly calls of public dry bulk shipping companies — executives maintain it's having a negative effect on rates. And yet, index data provided to FreightWaves by S&P Global Platts shows that the rate decline clearly predates the coronavirus. Base spot rates have actually bounced up off the bottom during the outbreak. So is the worst still to come, or are coronavirus dry bulk fears overblown? During the quarterly call of Genco Shipping & Trading (NYSE: GNK ) on Wednesday, CEO John Wobensmith said, ""In addition to seasonal weakness, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus has further impacted industrial activity, commodity demand and freight rates. ""It's still a little early to tell when Capesizes [bulkers with capacity of around 180,000 deadweight tons that carry iron ore and coal] start to move up in a significant way,"" he continued. ""Our belief is that when the coronavirus is contained and things are stabilized, the Chinese government will do a large stimulus package, and Capes will certainly benefit."" Platts Global Capesize Index If there is a negative effect from coronavirus on rates, it isn't showing up yet in the index data — a potentially ominous sign, given that data from CargoMetrics implies a sharp decline in China's bulk import appetite.",GNK,en,Benzinga Feeds

2020-02-03 16:09:03-05:00,Dry Bulk Rates Poised To Hit A New All-Time Low,"The record for the absolute worst dry bulk shipping spot rate of all time was set in February 2016, when the Baltic Dry Index (BDI) slumped to 219 points and vessel spot rates were just $2,000 per day. Four years later, that ignominious record may about to be broken. The BDI is now in freefall, closing at 466 on Monday, down over 80% since September 2019. Rates for Capesize bulkers (vessels with capacity of around 180,000 deadweight tons) are now at around $3,500-4,000 per day — less than a third of breakeven rates in the low teens. The two most important routes for Capesizes are the Brazil-China and Australia-China iron-ore runs. These two lanes now face pressures on multiple fronts, implying that rates have further to fall. First, there's seasonal demand weakness. Second, Brazilian iron-ore export regions are suffering debilitating floods. Third, there are too many ships in Australia. Fourth, the IMO 2020 rule requires the use of more expensive low-sulfur fuel, slashing ship owner returns.",GNK,en,Benzinga Feeds

Here Come The Dividends ""We think the reemergence of dividends will become a major theme in shipping equity markets over the next 12 months as companies institute and grow payouts in response to firming day rates and cleaned-up balance sheets across the group,"" asserted Amit Mehrotra, transportation analyst of Deutsche Bank, in a new client note.
