2019-11-27 17:35:30-05:00,"Tanker Bosses Give Thanks For Six-Figure Rates, Order Drought","Crude-tanker rates made headlines around the world in early October for briefly shooting into the stratosphere, reportedly topping $300,000 per day. What's happening now is not garnering the same press, but it could be even more bullish for tanker companies: Rates have persistently stayed above $60,000 a day through most of the fourth quarter and are back above the $100,000-a-day mark. The attention-grabbing rate pinnacle on Oct. 11 wasn't entirely real. Rates reported that day were agreed ""on subjects,"" referring to an approval process before a final deal is struck. Sanity prevailed and those $300,000-a-day contracts evaporated; the highest rates actually achieved were closer to $200,000 a day. Just a handful of very large crude carriers (VLCCs, tankers that carry 2 million barrels of crude oil each) were actually in position to take advantage of the early October run-up, which had been sparked by charterer fears in the wake of the Saudi oil-facility attacks, the security threat to tankers in the Middle East and U.S. sanctions targeting Chinese ship owner COSCO.",TNP,en,Benzinga Feeds
2019-11-27 09:19:00-05:00,Shipping's Spot-Rate Model Could Collide With Green Agenda,"The past two months have offered a textbook example of just how much stock investors crave the volatility of ocean shipping spot markets. Spot rates for very large crude carriers (VLCCs, tankers designed to carry 2 million barrels of crude oil) skyrocketed from $50,000 per day at the end of September to around $200,000 per day on Oct. 11, dropped back to $60,000 by mid-November and have now popped back above $100,000 per day. It's hard to find other markets to bet on that gyrate to this extreme. Tanker stocks with exposure to these spot rates have surged in response. This deep-seated focus on spot rates — not just among public and private investors but also among commodity charterers — could complicate plans to reduce the shipping industry's carbon footprint in the years ahead, a move that will almost certainly require much more time-charter coverage. Penalizing Period Charters Investors react negatively when ship owners do not have enough exposure to soaring spot rates. Case in point: the stock of Tsakos Energy Navigation or TEN (NYSE: TNP ), one of the largest tanker owners in the public market, which has lagged its compatriots, not just because it focuses on smaller vessel classes, but also because of its higher time-charter coverage.",TNP,en,Benzinga Feeds
