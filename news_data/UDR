As Bloomberg recaps, the 13F filings show that even more hedge funds leaned in to the stay-at-home trade amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Of note, Home Depot was a top new buy for Balyasny Asset Management, while Pershing Square Capital Management and Adage Capital Partners boosted stakes in Lowe’s. Coatue Management boosted its stakes in Peloton and Zoom Video Communications.
