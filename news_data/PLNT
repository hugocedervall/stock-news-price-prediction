2019-05-03 07:23:40-05:00,"Planet Fitness shares sink, analysts say buy the pullback","Planet Fitness Inc. stock sank 5.4% in Friday premarket trading despite earnings and same-store sales that beat expectations. Jonathan Komp, analyst at Baird, says investors should take advantage of an opportunity. ""While some variances versus estimates and the lack of near-term earnings upside could cause the stock to take a breather… we recommend investors buy any material pullbacks given Plant Fitness' attractive growth model and potential upside as 2019 progresses."" Baird maintains its outperform stock rating. Cowen analysts also think this is a ""buying opportunity,"" citing the difficulty that other companies will have trying to duplicate Planet Fitness' ""democratized"" approach to healthy living. Cowen rates Planet Fitness shares outperform with an $85 price target. Planet Fitness shares are up 30% for the last three months, and 40.5% for the year to date.
