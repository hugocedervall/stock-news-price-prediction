2020-12-06 04:15:05-05:00,Crazy golf on the first floor? UK’s department stores face radical remake,"As high street chains tumble, developers are looking for new uses for empty buildings Gyms, crazy golf, student flats, hotels or even a whisky-based tourist attraction: the future of many department store sites is unlikely to involve shopping. More than 200 of them are now empty or closing next year, and property experts say the shift will prompt a reinvention of malls and town centres on a scale not seen since the postwar years. Last week’s decision to wind down Debenhams is likely to see the closure of 124 stores – or just over a million square metres of retail floor space – in England and Wales. That’s the equivalent of 148 Premier League football pitches seeking a new purpose, according to property advisory firm Altus Group. Continue reading…",AIF,en,The Guardian

With many shops already boarded up and many more under threat of closure, a survey of more than 400 property development bosses by the consultancy Altus Group found that 38% of executives had already been switching their retail properties to other uses, while a further 57% were considering doing the same.

2020-09-18 23:38:30-05:00,Tax incentives for FPIs for choosing Gift City,"MUMBAI: Changes to the tax regulations introduced by the government on Friday will provide special incentive for foreign funds who choose to shift their base from Singapore or Mauritius to International Financial Services Centre (IFSC), Gift City, Gandhinagar. As a part of the Taxation and Other Laws Bill tabled in the Parliament, the Government has proposed to introduce a new regime for taxation of off-shore funds choosing Gift City. As per the proposed changes, profits and business income earned by such funds from Gift City will be tax exempt. Tax experts say, the changes are comparable to taxation of foreign funds domiciled in Fund jurisdictions such as Singapore and Ireland. Currently, funds coming from Singapore and Mauritius don’t pay any taxes on derivative trades. However, in the recent past the tax department has gone after some of such FPIs – especially those based out of Mauritius – from tax avoidance point of view. This has prompted several foreign funds to look at creating a domestic structure so that they comply with tax avoidance laws like General Anti-Avoidance Rules (GAAR).",AIF,en,Economic Times India

The committee in its report on ""Financing The Startup Ecosystem"" said the tax should be removed at least for the next two years to encourage investments amid the pandemic. ""The Committee would like to strongly recommend that tax on Long Term Capital Gains be abolished for all investments in startup companies (as designated by DPIIT) which are made through collective investment vehicles (CIVs) such as angel funds, AIFs, and investment LLPs,"" it said. It suggested that after this 2 year period, the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) may be applied to collective investment vehicles (CIV) so that revenue neutrality is maintained. Investments by CIVs are transparently done and have to be done at fair market value, the Standing Committee said, adding that it is easy to calculate the STT associated with these investments. ""This can be done in lieu of imposing LTCG on these CIVs and to make the taxation system fairer, less cumbersome, and transparent.",AIF,en,Sify.com

I want to talk about the wholesale portfolio. ECL Finance intends to sell another Rs 3,000 crore of wholesale portfolio in FY21. Where do you see exposure dropping down to when it comes to wholesale finance? Which are the segments that you are going to be focussing on for growth in the financial year ahead?In this year, we are not looking at a lot of credit growth at all -- both wholesale and retail. Our strategy is to bring wholesale down. By 2022, we want to make wholesale into zero and the reason for that is we want to convert the wholesale credit strategy into an asset management strategy. What we have learned in the last few years is wholesale credit is good business but a lot of that is like project finance and hence it cannot be done in an NBFC format. A lot of that needs to be done in an AIF format because in an AIF format, you do not have ALM mismatch or NPA issues because it is a close-ended fund and investors get a higher return on that.",AIF,en,Economic Times India
