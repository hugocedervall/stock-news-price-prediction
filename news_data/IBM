It's a hot market, with Microsoft, Google Cloud, and IBM making their own hybrid bets. IBM has even said that it sees hybrid cloud as a $1 trillion market within the next several years, which is why it spent $34 billion to acquire Red Hat . Notably, however, Amazon's recent commitment to hybrid cloud comes after years of ignoring, and occasionally trashing, the very concept. It had long been Amazon's position that public clouds like AWS, where customers rent functionally unlimited supercomputing power from the retailer's hyper-efficient data centers, was the wave of the future — in 2010, Amazon CTO Werner Vogels called hybrid the ""false cloud,"" and Bloomberg's Matt Day reported in 2016 that Jassy once flatly turned down major customer Siemens when it asked for hybrid support from AWS.",IBM,en,Business Insider

IBM’s focus on veterans IBM’s efforts to care of veterans goes back decades, to Thomas Watson Jr. (who is like Bill Gates at Microsoft in terms of his impact on the company). Watson, prior to becoming CEO, was an Army pilot in World War II and recognized the value of veterans at IBM.

Despite higher demand for seafood and fish, world reserves have not kept up, and aquaculture is becoming more common as a result. Aquaculture uses techniques of breeding marine species in all types of water environments as a means to supplement seafood demand. The practice comes with many advantages, including reducing the dependence on wild-caught species, but also raises environmental concerns, which some industry experts are trying to address with up-and-coming technologies such as analytics, blockchain, artificial intelligence and the internet of things. Jennifer Kemmerly, vice president of global ocean initiatives at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, said a focus on sustainability is necessary in the field, as 3 billion people rely on seafood, and 60 million people rely on the seafood industry for their livelihood.",IBM,en,GreenBiz

Activist investor Carl Icahn added to a stake last week. Financial companies and an options exchange operator saw insiders buying too. Conventional wisdom says that insiders and 10% shareholders really only buy shares of a company for one reason -- they believe the stock price will rise and they want to profit from it. So insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors, particularly when markets are near all-time highs. Though buy windows remain closed for many insiders during earnings-reporting season, plenty of others have continued to add shares despite market volatility and economic uncertainty. Here are some of the most noteworthy insider purchases reported in the past week. Carl Icahn, a 10% shareholder of Xerox Holdings Corp. (NYSE: XRX ), indirectly added about 1.06 million shares to his stake at prices ranging from $18.26 to $18.93 apiece. That cost him more than $19.45 million and raised the stake to over 28.52 million shares.",IBM,en,Benzinga

One of them, Ayar Labs, just raised $35 million, an amount that CEO Charles Wuischpard said was bigger than they had expected to raise during a pandemic. The Silicon Valley startup had hoped to raise $35 million before the crisis began, but then decided to scale down their plans. ""Everybody, everything was shut down, people weren't investing and the market was frozen,"" Wuischpard told Business Insider. ""The original idea is we'd only raise you know $8 to $10 million, and that'd be enough to tide us over. But people were opening up. We kept increasing the size of the round and lo and behold we got ourselves back to the $35 million number.""

But the higher risk of defaults has consequences for stakeholders beyond the private equity owners.” – Financial Times, September 2020 INTRODUCTION Winter came a few months early last week, as Snowflake (SNOW) had a highly successful Initial Public Offering, rising over 111% from its offering price in its first day of trading to a cool market cap of $67.4B. With eight rounds under its parka belt prior to last Wednesday’s IPO, the mountain-top ascent was a highpoint for a number of private investors, some of whom invested in the company as early as 2012. Of course, not all private investments turn out so successfully, but the rapid growth story underscores an important phenomenon that is the subject of this week’s newsletter from Louis-Vincent Gave: the willingness to trade liquidity for the potential of income or growth.",IBM,en,Zero Hedge
2020-11-06 10:00:00-05:00,IBM is targeting telcom giants with a new product made possible by its $34 billion Red Hat acquisition and an exec says it shows the company's master plan for cloud,"Summary List Placement About a year and a half after IBM acquired Red Hat for $34 billion , it's relying on the open source software giant to roll out a new cloud product targeting the telecommunications industry on Thursday that embodies how the firm hopes to differentiate its cloud offerings and grow its business. The platform uses Red Hat's OpenShift — which allows developers to run code across multiple cloud providers and their own data centers with minimal changes to the code — to help heavily-regulated telecom companies deploy 5G and scale their businesses. While IBM's efforts follow similar telecom-specific offerings from AWS , Google , and Azure, an exec thinks there's still room to carve out a niche. ""The way [the product] differentiates itself is the way we differentiate ourselves from the current public cloud offerings, which is: we're open,"" IBM senior vice president, Howard Boville, told Business Insider. IBM initially became a tech powerhouse by providing hardware, software, and services to companies that ran their own in-house data centers, but fell behind the likes of AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google in the shift to the cloud.",IBM,en,Business Insider

Smart city projects promise to reduce commute times by 15-20%, shrink a city's environmental footprint by 10-30%, and overall make citizens happier and more engaged, per McKinsey. But many smart city projects elicit public backlash stemming from concerns of government overreach—for instance, nearly half of US adults do not trust law enforcement to use facial recognition technology responsibly, while 69% felt uncomfortable about how governments handle data, according to Pew Research. This election cycle, voters in Portland, Maine and California got a chance to directly vote on the acceptable use of technology by the government—here's what happened: Voters in Portland, Maine approved a ballot measure to ban the government use of facial recognition technologies.

The lawsuit, which is being brought by the US Department of Justice and 11 state attorneys general, takes a relatively narrow focus on Google's dominance in search and search advertising. Google, the suit argues, has leveraged its dominance to maintain partnerships, including a lucrative deal to be the default search provider on Apple devices, that has shut out rivals. The complaint calls back to the Microsoft case of the late 1990s, where the company was accused of illegally bundling its internet browser and operating system together in a way that hurt competitors. The case against Google not only references that case, but explicitly calls back to it in certain places.

But there's another component to transformations, too: reputation. Walmart, for example, is investing heavily in technology, both as part of its epic battle with Amazon for retail dominance and from a desire to be viewed as a software behemoth . The company works with a slew of outside vendors , but is developing many of applications in-house, as well — like its recent express delivery option . The overhaul is so robust that some Wall Street analysts believe Walmart's stock should be treated more like that of a tech company. In the case of Aventiv Technologies — the parent-firm of prison communications company Securus Technologies that's backed by billionaire Tom Gores — new CEO Dave Abel is relying on a digital overhaul to rebuild a tattered public image . Securus has faced heavy criticism over the past few years for the costs it charges prison inmates to use the services, which lawsuits allege is sometimes as high as $15.99 for a 15-minute call.",IBM,en,Business Insider

What is your view?The quantum is lower and will not move the lever in a big way. It will not even be 1.7% of equity. The market was wondering if this buyback was to try and raise money for Shapoorji Pallonji but that does not seem to be the case.It is actually just 1.5% of the equity count.

Yet calculating the financial risk of cybersecurity vulnerability has historically been an inexact process – with big penalties. The price of Verizon's 2017 acquisition of Yahoo's internet business suddenly plunged $350 million when data breaches were discovered. From major acquisitions to minor data breaches, cybersecurity risk – put in dollars – has been difficult for companies to factor in. IBM says it is bringing new clarity and tools to the high-priced, sometimes murky world of cybersecurity risk on Tuesday with the announcement of new cybersecurity ""risk quantification services."" The company says the new services help companies systematically evaluate security risks – such as data breaches from an acquired company – the same way companies evaluate other budget items.

2020-09-15 07:37:00-05:00,A top IBM exec explains how its ambitious new roadmap for its quantum computing efforts could be 'game-changing' for the potentially revolutionary industry,"Summary List Placement The future of quantum computing could be closer than you think — at least, if IBM has its way. The technology powerhouse is confident that in just a few years it will cross a significant milestone towards eventually having a full-proof system capable of solving problems currently deemed impossible by today's compute standards. While complicated, the firm is promising to deliver a 1,000 qubit quantum computer by 2023, per a Tuesday announcement. IBM also said it built a refrigerator dubbed ""Goldeneye"" that could eventually provide the cooling necessary to meet the demands of storing a million-plus qubit device. Qubits are effectively the building blocks of quantum. Unlike traditional computers that operate as a function of zero or one, qubits can be both at the same time, permitting the systems to process immensely more complex algorithms. So essentially, the higher the qubit chip, the more powerful the computer. The company — which says it has over 100 clients using its quantum tech — is also aiming to double its capabilities every year, so crossing the 1,000-qubit benchmark is an inflection point that will spur rapid evolution, according to IBM Research Director Dario Gil. ""The last few doublings are absolutely game changing,"" he told Business Insider. ""That is the absolute key to be able to then run applications that you could not run classically."" The quantum race is on The timeline is also notable because quantum computing remains a largely academic topic today, with large corporations like IBM, Microsoft, Honeywell, and others all vying to hit the next milestone towards mainstream adoption first.",IBM,en,Business Insider

2020-09-14 03:08:01-05:00,IBM calls for limiting export of facial recognition software,"San Francisco, Sep 14 (IANS) After revealing its decision to terminate general purpose facial recognition and analysis software products in June, technology giant IBM has now called for greater restrictions on export of facial recognition software from the US. In a letter to the US Department of Commerce last week, IBM recommended that the country restrict the export of facial recognition technologies that employ what it called ""1-to-many"" matching end uses. ""This is the type of facial recognition technology most likely to be used for mass surveillance, racial profiling, or other violations of human rights,"" IBM said in the letter dated September 11. ""To effectively target export controls on these particular use-cases of facial recognition technologies, we believe such rules should focus on the high-resolution cameras used to collect data and the software algorithms used to analyse and match that data in the context of a '1-to-many' facial recognition system."" According to IBM, the ""1-to-many"" systems are distinct from ""1 to 1"" facial matching systems, such as those that might unlock your phone or allow you to board an airplane -- in those cases, facial recognition is verifying that a consenting person is who they say they are.",IBM,en,Sify.com

With fires up and down the west coast, the ongoing pandemic, weird weather and – in the U.S. – an election, folks are getting overwhelmed.

IBM, Microsoft, and unlikely incumbents like Honeywell are all trying to rush to build their own quantum computers — competing against upstarts like Q-CTRL and IonQ. But the focus has largely been academic thus far, with each company trying to best the compute power of the other . That's beginning to change. Amazon Web Services, for example, recently announced that Braket, its platform to give customers access to quantum computers from startups D-Wave, IonQ, and Rigetti, would be generally available to the public. This essentially means that developers can easily begin testing out their algorithms on actual machines. Microsoft is offering a similar arrangement, but it's currently still in beta mode. Read more: The CEO of $116 billion industrial giant Honeywell says that the company's ambitious transformation into a software powerhouse will hinge on acquisitions and investments in emerging tech like AI and quantum computing While the technology is still a ways off from ubiquitous use, the milestone signals a shift, and enterprises like Fidelity are getting serious about building their own quantum muscles internally. ""It's going to take customers some time — four or five years — to build up an internal team and expertise, and to recruit the right staff to program these devices, which are programmed in a completely different way than a regular computer,"" Richard Moulds, general manager of Amazon Braket, told Business Insider.

In March, the company unveiled a quantum computer that surpassed the capabilities of Silicon Valley competitors like Google and announced JPMorgan Chase as an inaugural customer . Just days after that, COVID-19 began to quickly spread through the US and the company immediately ramped up production of face masks to help mitigate a shortage of the protective equipment in the early days of the crisis. In June, Honeywell announced a new partnership with SAP to help building managers automate aspects of their facilities. It also rolled-out an ultralight cleaning system to help airlines better sanitize planes in-between flights. Then, in August, the company was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average . Now, as Honeywell prepares to celebrate its 100th year as a publicly-traded company, Adamczyk has no plans to slow-down the firm's transformation from a manufacturing giant best-known for digital thermostats to a software powerhouse that can rival the offerings of firms like Salesforce. ""We're an industrial technology company that continues to stay relevant by anticipating the needs of our customers, anticipating where the world is going, and then investing in those technologies to make sure we capture that value,"" he told Business Insider. ""My personal goal is to continue to stay relevant, to continue to drive the transformation."" In just over three years at the helm of Honeywell, Adamczyk has left a lasting mark on the company, perhaps most notably by elevating Forge — the firm's software division — to its own business unit (it previously spanned different verticals, like aerospace and e-commerce, which elicited some confusion among employees as to their exact role within the company).",IBM,en,Business Insider

That said, there was a silver lining: after the company reported the lowest revenue in the 21st century last quarter at $17.6BN, in Q2 IBM managed a modest sequential rebound, with revenue rising to 18.1$BN, even as Wall Street was expecting another 20 year low in the top-line.

To work on the goal of de-biasing AI, her team created an open source library with three algorithms meant to help de-bias existing AI models. The problem with biased AI often stems from the fact that the data used to train models is incomplete or tainted by human biases, but Abacus can adjust systems without needing new data or to retrain them ""from scratch."" This new tool is launching as the startup raises $13 million in Series A funding led by Index Ventures and adds two new board members: Mike Volpi from Index and Google founding board member Ram Shriram. With its new funding, Abacus.AI plans to continue researching AI issues and turning its findings into actual products for customers. Click here for more BI Prime stories .

Among the reasons for issuing the ban, the ordinance cited ""racial bias in facial surveillance"" and the potential for surveillance tools to damage public trust in government. Councilor Michelle Wu specifically referenced the false arrest of Robert Julian-Borchak Williams, a Black man living in Michigan. Detroit police arrested and interrogated Williams after facial recognition software incorrectly identified him in robbery surveillance footage, according to a New York Times investigation released this week. The incident is believed to represent the first instance of facial recognition leading to a false arrest in the US. Local bans on facial recognition, like this Boston ordinance, will undercut big tech efforts to instate facial recognition reform at the federal level. In response to heightened public scrutiny, Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft suspended or terminated the sale of facial recognition services to law enforcement; the companies also advocated for federal regulation of the technology.",IBM,en,Business Insider

As for Uber's stock? With rides increasing again, it's now trading 18% higher than where it was when the year began, back when people were actually going places. Anywhere you look in tech lately, the message is about getting back to business. Google is tidying up the Googleplex to welcome the first batch of returnees in a few weeks , and Apple Geniuses are reporting for duty at stores around the world.",IBM,en,Business Insider

Little did we know that just a few hours later demand for the offering would overflow dealer books, and the result as announced late on Monday, was the sale of $10 billion in a more than 3x-oversubscribed offering (led by DB, GS, HSBC, JPM) that included three-year notes carrying an interest rate of just 0.4%. This means that just days after US investment-grade issuers sold more than a record $1 trillion in debt in just the first 5 month, Amazon locked in the lowest borrowing costs ever secured in the US corporate bond market. The rate on 3Y notes was below the previous record low of 0.45% reached in 2012 and 2013 by companies including Apple, IBM and Walt Disney.",IBM,en,Zero Hedge

But the acquisition propelled Lenovo to become the world's top PC vendor, which is giving the tech giant the financial muscle to expand its reach beyond hardware, he said.

Authored by Michael Kern via SafeHaven.com, What happens when quantum computing hits the masses and becomes just as common as a smartphone? We may not have to wait that long to find out. It’s what comes next, according to Bank of America strategist Haim Israel. Israel hails quantum computing as a revolutionary product for this decade, saying it will be as big as smartphones were in the 2010s. Scientists aren’t so sure, and not nearly as optimistic. Many equate quantum computing for the space race of the 1950s. We’re not quite there yet, either, but perhaps that’s because the government dropped the ball and things are only now picking up in the hands of big tech. So, still a long shot but it is a race for sure. The U.S., China and Russia are all competing to achieve quantum supremacy. The scientists and experts involved don’t object to the race itself--just what the term ‘supremacy’. It’s a big dramatic for their tastes, and they would instead prefer to call it the “quantum advantage”.",IBM,en,Zero Hedge

Submitted By James Williams | 18/12/2019 - 10:28am A recent white paper I read from Willis Towers Watson (Willis) suggests that the level of alpha and the volatility of alpha are at their lowest levels. The paper – Hedge Funds: A New Way – ultimately goes on to make a positive case for why hedge funds remain integral to investors’ portfolios but it is interesting to think, for a moment, as to why alpha levels are so low. The data set used by Willis Towers Watson covered a period from 1993 to 2018. It found that the highest levels of rolling monthly alpha occurred between 1993 and 1998, while the lowest occurred from 2012 to 2018. Is this part of a longer-term trend of subdued returns as public markets continue to shrink? Or, like all financial markets, is this a temporary cycle that hedge funds will break out of? I spoke to one of the authors of the paper, Sara Rejal, Head of Liquid Alternatives at Willis Towers Watson, to get her thoughts. “When we plotted the results,” she said, “we discovered that actually it does look like over time the amount of alpha has been reducing.",IBM,en,Hedgeweek

For existing IT service providers, this not only shrinks the market in terms of the number of prospective clients, but also poses challenges with respect to scale as banks become larger.“With multiple banks becoming one, there will be synergy on technology spends, in the number of data centres, number of servers, locations, software being used, and other services offered. Further, with time, these will get optimised even more,” said Sundar Sundararajan, executive director, i-exceed Technology Solutions, a company that offers a digital banking platform to financial institutions globally.And, since most service providers work on a model where companies pay for the services upfront and then bear a charge for maintenance, a reduction in the number of prospective customers will affect revenues, industry executives said.The other challenge is that smaller service providers will need to scale up their own platforms to be able to support the bigger entity that will be created after a merger. “When two PSU megabanks merge, the scale is akin to two large countries like the UK and Germany merging.",IBM,en,The Economic Times India

2019-08-23 12:30:00-05:00,A new tool by IBM is helping to change the game for professional tennis coaches,"Over the course of a Grand Slam tournament, professional tennis players will spend hours on the court. Traditionally, coaches have had to rely on things like posture and facial expressions to evaluate players' endurance. But now, technology is getting in the game. A new tool developed by IBM and the USTA uses artificial intelligence and analytics to quantify physical exertion. With Coach Advisor, coaches will have access to timely data about their players' energy levels and ways to improve it. It's an evolution of the work that IBM and the USTA have been doing at the US Open for nearly 30 years, according to Elizabeth O'Brien, the Program Director for IBM's Sports and Entertainment Partnerships. ""Every year we think about what kind of innovation we can bring that would have a meaningful impact,"" O'Brien said. When the USTA made a bigger push into player development a few years ago, O'Brien said it was a natural fit for IBM's technology. Coaches can help their players improve in new ways ""A key factor in player performance was energy management, which is a fancy way of saying, 'How are they managing how tired they are?'"" O'Brien said. ""It wasn't something that had ever been quantified or measured."" IBM worked with the USTA to quantify two energy systems: mechanical load (""think sprints, where you get breathless just watching,"" O'Brien said) and physiological load, or players' endurance over time. ""Watching those loads, as we evaluate more data, we understand where particular players' ranges are, the sweet spot where they're not over-exerting themselves,"" she said. ""Then we look for when player's effort levels go above or below their range."" That data is then correlated with traditional tennis statistics and paired with video in a player development portal.",IBM,en,Business Insider

Hybrid cloud computing enables businesses to use combinations of both public cloud platforms and their own in-house data centers. Even AWS, the cloud's dominant player, has acknowledged the importance of on-premise data centers, and made preliminary moves to support them. After outpacing enterprise players like Microsoft and IBM in the cloud, Amazon faces a tougher challenge in hybrid cloud. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. There was a mad rush to the cloud after tech giants, led by Amazon, talked big corporations, startups, and mom-and-pop shops into abandoning in-house data centers and servers and doing all their computing on the web. Nowadays, cloud computing is a market valued at as much as $46 billion, with Amazon Web Services alone booking $7.7 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter, up 41% from the same period of 2018.

2019-05-31 15:00:00-05:00,This is the next step for the cloud,"By Hillery Hunter, IBM Fellow, VP, and CTO, Cloud Infrastructure, IBM Cloud infrastructure has become a ubiquitous part of our daily lives. While most people primarily associate the cloud with backing up their phone or storing photos online, you're actually using the cloud in more ways than you may realize. The cloud plays a critical role when we check in at the airport, interact with customer support from our favorite store, use a mobile banking app, or check the weather forecast. But even these experiences are just starting to scratch the surface of the impact that the cloud can have on our lives. So, what actually is ""the cloud"" and why is it important? Let's start by taking a step back. What is the cloud: beyond infrastructure as a service The concept of cloud computing was introduced in the mid-2000s. It started as a way for businesses to rent IT infrastructure and computing power (""infrastructure as a service"") and access software at a massive global scale. This first chapter of cloud was all about driving productivity and cost benefits, and, for many, this model of cloud has become the new dial tone of IT.",IBM,en,Business Insider

Santander announced that it plans to offer telephone banking customers the option to verify their identity via phone ID and biometric voice ID technology, according to Fintech Finance . This will eliminate the need for customers to type in lengthy personal ID and security numbers when completing phone authentication. Additionally, Santander is introducing natural language processing to its telephone banking service, which means customers can state a question and the tech will redirect them to the relevant team within the bank. Here's what it means: Santander is making its phone banking features more robust and secure, but consumer demand for such features might not be as high as it once was. Biometrics can help Santander combat phone verification fraud.

But these conflict minerals, as they’re known, frequently follow a sketchy path from mine to factory, coming from mines whose profits flow to violent militias, criminals, and even terrorists. As human-rights groups step up pressure on big companies to better police the provenance of raw materials in the $600 billion industry, Nathan Williams says he can help. He’s chief executive officer of Minespider, a startup that’s using blockchain, the technology at the heart of Bitcoin, to better track shipments of metals as they move from mines to smelters and then on to factories worldwide. Blockchain, a database file from which information can’t be deleted, is infinitely expandable to accommodate new entries.

2019-04-09 16:02:00-05:00,How crowdsourcing shipping through technology will make last mile delivery cheaper (AMZN),"The proliferation of e-commerce has transformed free shipping and same-day delivery from perks to table stakes — and retailers are paying the price. With daily parcel volumes surging and customers increasingly unlikely to foot the bill, companies have been tasked with finding new ways to offer speedy shipments without eating costs. Among the most popular strategies is crowdsourced delivery, the Uber model helping online shops solve the most expensive part of shipping: the last mile problem . Like Uber and other ride hailing apps, a number of crowdsourced delivery solutions have been cropping up over the past few years to ease these pains by connecting customers directly with local couriers. And it’s not just startups either; Amazon, the world's undisputed e-commerce leader, is investing big in crowdsourcing deliveries. How much does Amazon spend on shipping? “Free shipping” comes at a high cost. According to Amazon’s 2017 annual report , the company spent $21.7 billion in shipping last year — a number that includes sortation, delivery center, and transportation costs.",IBM,en,Business Insider

The internet was meant to be open, free, and decentralized, but today it is controlled by a few companies with grave consequences for society and the economy. The internet has become the opposite of what it was intended to be. In the early 1960s, Paul Baran was an engineer at the RAND Corporation when he began thinking about the need for a communications network that could withstand a nuclear strike. RAND was contracted by the Pentagon to create a system that could continue operating even if parts of it were destroyed by an atomic blast. It was supposed to be the ultimate decentralized system. Baran went on to publish a paper in 1964 titled “ On Distributed Communications, ” which was influential in establishing the concepts behind the architecture of the internet. Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn put these concepts into practice at the Department of Defense’s Advanced Research Projects Agency in the late 1960s, and created the communication methods that make the internet possible.",IBM,en,Zero Hedge

Although far from discovering some new source of alpha, according to Goldman's analysis of the latest batch of 13F filings, the recent strong hedge fund returns have benefited from the outperformance of the most popular long positions as well as the decision to increase net length ahead of the equity market bottom in December 2018. Furthermore, the relative performance of Goldman's Hedge Fund VIP basket and hedge fund net long exposure each bottomed in the days before the S&P 500 reached its low on December 24. So far in 2019, the VIP basket, which tracks the most popular long positions, has returned +14%, outperforming both the S&P 500 (+11%) and Goldman's basket of the largest short positions (GSTHVISP, +7%), which is to be expected in light of the massive short squeeze that has taken place in the past 9 weeks.","IBM,I",en,Zero Hedge

Buffett continued to bid up bank shares, making his Omaha-based firm a major shareholder in four of the five largest US banks. This includes increasing stakes in JP Morgan and Bank of America during the last three months of the year. Buffett also boosted his stakes in regional lenders like PNC Financial Services Group and US Bancorp which may have been plays on consolidation in the industry (a trend that is starting to play out following the recent BB&T-Suntrust deal ). And while bank stocks have rallied during the opening weeks of the year during one of the biggest market rebounds in recent memory, Buffett unexpectedly cut his stake in Apple.",IBM,en,Zero Hedge

Operation Cloudhopper, as it's called, is one of the most extensive Chinese hacking campaigns ever exposed. The DOJ has already brought charges against some of the hackers allegedly responsible (though it's unlikely they will ever see the inside of a US courtroom or jail cell). During Cloudhopper's heyday, the MSS-affiliated hacking group known only as ""ATP10"" (Advanced Persistent Threat 10), infiltrated storied US firms including IBM and HP. It was widely believed by intelligence officials that ATP targeted MSPs in Europe, Asia and beyond, as well as the US.

How weak is China’s growth?” said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab & Co.

Today's drop brings Berkshire's holdings to about $36 billion, and a $3.8 billion loss, and has also hammered Berkshire Hathaway's Class A stock which is down more than $15K today, or 4.93%, its biggest one day drop since the February 5 VIXtermination event. Ignoring that one-time drop which quickly reversed, one would have to go back to August 2011 when the US was downgraded, to find an even bigger drop. That said, Buffett may be enjoying the drop: the billionaire first announced Berkshire was buying Apple in February 2017 despite his usual aversion to tech stocks and following his disastrous foray into tech investing with IBM.",IBM,en,Zero Hedge
