The fund managers outlined which thematic and single-stock strategies paid off for them this year, and they laid out their top trades and ideas for 2020. If you followed only financial-news headlines in 2019, you might assume the market had a tough year.

Thank the Federal Reserve and its overt willingness to continuing stimulating an economic expansion that's already the longest in history. But even amid a robust market environment that saw every major stock index climb for the year, a handful of fund managers stood out as the cream of the crop. These were the people and firms that were still able to outperform, even though equities and other risk assets were so strong across the board.","CCH,CBRE",en,Business Insider
