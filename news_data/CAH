That same year Amazon also aligned itself with Berkshire Hathaway Inc., and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to form the Haven Healthcare venture to stem employer-health care spending, although turnover at the alliance has kept any major disruption to health-care companies at bay.For drug stores, Amazon’s move is “net negative and will likely bring back conversations about the appropriate multiples despite recent positive news about the role of drug stores in coronavirus vaccine distribution,” Evercore ISI analyst Elizabeth Anderson said in a note. “This will likely create an overhang for the group until we determine the take up of Amazon Pharmacy.”Walgreens Boots sank as much as 10%, Rite Aid plunged 17% and CVS Health dropped 8.5%.AmerisourceBergen Corp., Amazon and PillPack’s distributor, should benefit from the shift online, Anderson said.",CAH,en,Yahoo Finance

Sanjiv Bhaskar, Vice President, Global PPE Practice, offered his informed perspectives. Here are some key takeaways. Industrial PPE markets will experience a decline in revenue, but healthcare PPE will benefit from unprecedented growth. Rising unemployment and the overall economic impact of COVID-19 will result in a 3 to 6% drop in the industrial PPE sector, said Bhaskar.
