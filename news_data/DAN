Although the government has said that payments using UPI would be free, bankers say that the charges have been introduced to prevent frivolous transactions from putting a load on the system.According to a report published by Ashish Das by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay, banks are interpreting the law to suit them to conclude that, while 'payments' are free, transfers can be charged. The report highlights this as an anomaly as such an interpretation would mean that if a user decides to use UPI to split a restaurant bill, the transfers from friends would not count as among the free transactions.The report calls for doing away the difference with the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) compensating banks as UPI is the simplest alternative to cash.

The committee will now be overhauled with three new external members expected to join by October and possibly changes to its targeting framework being introduced sometime next year.If inflation exceeds the upper limit of the target band for three consecutive quarters, the RBI Act requires Governor Shaktikanta Das to write a letter to the government to explain why the MPC failed to meet its goal.

According to RBI guidelines restructuring without changing the management currently means the account is automatically classified as NPA invoking higher provisions and hitting bank profits.However this latest dispensation is for a limited period and specifically for companies and individuals who cannot pay back due to Covid 19 related pressures.

At the same time, there are lessons from the past that needed to be kept in mind before granting the next boon.After months of debate, Governor Das unveiled one that rested on the Prudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets issued in June 2019, a palatable formula born out of a legal tussle between bankrupt borrowers and a regulator entrusted with safeguarding the common man’s nest egg.To begin with, this is not old wine in a new bottle.

Announcing a series of liquidity and regulatory measures to ensure economic activity continues in this period of Covid-19 outbreak and the lockdown, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said advances under the special liquidity facility would be charged at repo rate at the time of avail. This will allow the institutions to provide onward support to housing finance companies and small non-bank finance companies at competitive rates.

""A more favourable food inflation outlook may emerge as the bumper rabi harvest eases prices of cereals, especially if open market sales and public distribution offtake are expanded on the back of significantly higher procurement.

""The abatement of price pressure in key vegetables is delayed and remains contingent upon normalisation of supplies. Protein-based food items could also emerge as a pressure point.""

In a video address post the Monetary Policy Committee's (MPC) meeting, the Reserve Bank of India Governor said that the move has been announced in a bid to provide relief to stressed companies which have not been able to repay loans due to cash flow issues amid the pandemic. The prudential framework dated June 7, 2019 provides a principle-based resolution framework for addressing borrower defaults under a normal scenario.

He’s likely to stay in his post after India concludes its election process on May 23, central bank watchers say.That should be a relief to investors who had to grapple with a fair bit of upheaval at the Reserve Bank of India late last year. Urjit Patel resigned abruptly as governor in December after tussling with Modi’s government over a number of issues. Das was appointed shortly after for a three-year term that ends in December 2021.“Das has worked with distinction with both governments and therefore the probability of his continuing and completing the tenure should be extremely high,"" said Ashok Chawla, a former top government official who worked with Das in the finance ministry.Before becoming governor, Das was economic affairs secretary in Modi’s government, and the public face of the prime minister’s controversial decision in November 2016 to ban high-value currency notes.Since his appointment at the central bank, he’s taken a number of steps to support the economy and that helps Modi’s regime: he’s lowered interest rates, relaxed lending norms for banks to increase credit flow, and named a panel to consider transferring the RBI’s excess capital to the government.Comfortable WorkingHe’s just as comfortable working with a Congress-led government.",DAN,en,The Economic Times India

It softened its policy stance to neutral in February and maintained that last week.""If easing of monetary policy is required but the central bank prefers to be cautious in its accommodation, a 10 basis points reduction in the policy rate would perhaps communicate the intent of authorities more clearly than two separate moves –- one on the policy rate, wasting 15 basis points of valuable rate action to rounding off, and the other on the stance, which in a sense, binds future policy action to a pre-committed direction,"" he said.The governor, who took over from Urjit Patel in December after the latter quit following differences with the government, has reversed two hikes made by his predecessor last year.",DAN,en,The Economic Times India
2019-04-04 02:47:54-05:00,Shaktikanta Das prefers to go with official data,"Governor Shaktikanta Das sticks to official statistics for his policy. Das told reporters on Thursday that the RBI goes with the numbers prepared by the Central Statistics Office (CSO).A group of over 100 economists had gone public with their reservations on the GDP and other key dataprints last month in the light of the frequent revisions in the way the numbers are computed. When asked about his meeting with finance minister Arun Jaitley ahead of the policy, Das said there is nothing ""unusual"" about such a move.Das' predecessor Urjit Patel, along with his five-member Monetary Policy Committee, had once declined to meet the finance minister earlier.Das said such meetings have been on either physically or otherwise, even after the move to MPC-led rate setting.The central bank is monitoring the fiscal situation and will continue to watch the space closely, Das said. Meanwhile, to a specific question on the delay in the Jalan committee report on the economic capital framework for the central bank, which will define how much the idle capital the RBI can keep with itself and and how much of it can be parted with, Das said the panel requires a few more days to come out with its recommendations.The RBI keeps a capital buffer of over Rs 9.4 lakh crore now, which a section in the government feels is too highg and thus should be parted with for better productive deployment like funding the cash-starved state-run banks or cash-crunched power distribution companies.",DAN,en,The Economic Times India

2019-02-07 05:56:41-05:00,RBI Bows To Political Pressure With Unexpected Rate Cut,"Fed Chairman Jerome Powell isn't the only leader of a major central bank to capitulate to political (and market) pressure so far this year. On Thursday, RBI Gov. Shaktikanta Das during his first meeting at the helm of the bank led a 4-2 vote to cut rates after raising them twice last year. Shaktikanta Das Das was widely seen bowing to pressures from Prime Minister Nahrendra Modi, who is desperately trying to boost economic growth ahead of a re-election fight later this year. As one analyst at Mizuho Bank pointed out, the move risks reviving inflationary pressures in India after they had largely eased last year. Das was hastily appointed to lead the central bank in December after his predecessor quit following a very public battle over the RBI's autonomy. “If caught wrong-footed by higher oil, twin deficit worries and global risk aversion, the rupee may have to pay the price for monetary complacency, whether perceived or real,” says Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Perceptions matter for India’s monetary policy, which is trying to target inflation expectations USD/INR may rise above 72.5 over the next 3-4 months; Mizuho’s view was for a prolonged hold in policy The RBI cut its repurchase rate 25 basis points to 6.25%, a move that only 11 of 43 economists polled by Bloomberg had anticipated.",DAN,en,Zero Hedge
