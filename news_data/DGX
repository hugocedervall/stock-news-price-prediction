2020-12-09 10:51:09-05:00,Ro's telehealth diversification play is a sign that mass telehealth acquisitions are on the horizon,"Summary List Placement Ro—a pharmacy delivery vendor and telemedicine provider—is expanding its scope of care delivery services with its acquisition of Workpath, a software developer that deploys nearby clinicians to patients' homes for blood draws and nurse visits, per Forbes. Ro also linked up with lab giant Quest Diagnostics to process the tests. This marks Ro's first acquisition and is the latest move in a busy few years for the startup: It launched in 2017 as a pharmacy business for men's health but has expanded into women's health, smoking cessation, and weight loss—and it's secured $376 million along the way and earned itself a spot in the digital health unicorn club. Telemedicine is in a boom period, but there's plenty of care that can't be delivered virtually—so, a move into home-based care could make Ro relevant for a litany of care needs. US patients have grown more accustomed to virtual care amid the pandemic: 37% US adults had tried it as of September—up more than threefold from January, according to CivicScience.",DGX,en,Business Insider

According to Johns Hopkins data , the test-positivity rates have exceeded a World Health Organization-recommended threshold of 5% in the vast majority of US states. With the rising number of COVID 19 cases across the US, doubts are being raised about the tests used for diagnosis and their ambiguity. What has also caused doubts is the high number of false positives and false negatives shown by the tests. In a recent incident, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) founder Elon Musk took four rapid antigen tests and received two positive and two negative results. Musk called it “extremely bogus,” and he’s not wrong.

Here's how they work and where to order one.,"Summary List Placement Among the hundreds of tests out there for the novel coronavirus, just a handful have received emergency authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration to ship them to people's homes. With at-home tests, people self-collect their samples and send them back to the testing company for analysis. Several companies are developing tests that can work fully at home without shipping and lab equipment involved, but they haven't received the FDA's go-ahead yet. Still, ordering a test from the comfort of home can be appealing. It not only avoids run-ins with the physical healthcare system, saving time, but also reduces the risk of spreading the virus or getting infected yourself. Lab giant Quest Diagnostics has sold about half a million home tests, though that number includes self-collected samples taken in drive-thrus, the company told Business Insider in October.

Walmart's latest move highlights how retail pharmacies have leveraged drone delivery during the pandemic—but we think it will have limited utility in the broader healthcare space. For instance, CVS made similar moves earlier this year when it partnered with UPS to offer Florida retirement facilities drone delivery for prescription drugs. However, drone manufacturers must overcome a number of regulatory hurdles from the Federal Aviation Administration before they're given the greenlight to launch—making it difficult for other healthcare entities, like hospitals and clinics, to deploy drones regularly.",DGX,en,Business Insider

It revealed an unclear path for how to reopen the economy and stop the virus' spread.,"While the US sets new records for single-day cases, many employers aren't sure if they'll test office workers for the novel coronavirus, or how. Amazon, Goldman Sachs, Target, and others aren't reporting concrete plans to test all workers yet. Methods like temperature checks are common to reduce spread, but don't catch symptom-less cases. That spells trouble for the 45% of American employees who aren't working from home full-time. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . While the US sets new records for single-day coronavirus cases, employers are increasingly grappling with strategies — or sometimes a lack thereof — for how to get their workers tested. Most are requiring face masks, rejiggering their sites to accommodate social distancing, and doing temperature checks, but 56% haven't decided if they'll require testing for on-site workers, according to a poll of 40 manufacturers, tech firms, municipalities, retailers, and educators by Pacific Business Group on Health, a nonprofit coalition of large employers like American Airlines, Microsoft, Tesla, and Stanford University.",DGX,en,Business Insider

Unfortunately, both of those blood tests for novel-coronavirus antibodies came out negative, meaning I remain vulnerable to being infected and infecting others. (Sorry, Mom.) But at least I learned something about how this testing works and what it can reveal. Antibody tests , also called serological tests, differ from the diagnostic tests that check for the virus’s genetic material . Instead of showing where the virus is today, they reveal where it’s been, as seen in the virus-fighting antibodies that your body develops two weeks or so after a novel-coronavirus infection. These tests also feature a less invasive patient experience. Instead of having a swab inserted uncomfortably far up your nose, you sit through a quick blood draw from a vein in your arm. But for months, serological tests were as hard to schedule as the first diagnostic tests. It didn’t help when companies rushed to ship inaccurate tests after the Food and Drug Administration eased its usual approval process to try to cope with the coronavirus crisis.",DGX,en,Fast Company

Social distancing . . . temperature checks . . . obsessive hand washing . . . face masks and shields . . . double and triple shifts to comply with strict capacity requirements. And that bulletin board where the company proudly touted the number of days without a workplace injury? Now it might have a poster showing how long the facility has been COVID-19 free. Not only is it not your father’s factory anymore, it’s not even the one you knew a couple of months ago! And that new reality has spawned a whole new ecosystem. The Cleveland Clinic has published “ Return to Work Amid COVID-19: A Cleveland Clinic Guide for Manufacturers ,” which can be downloaded from its website.
