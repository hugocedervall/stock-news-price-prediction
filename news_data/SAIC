Why is the installation rate of automated parking not high? Automated parking was found in 7.7 percent of passenger cars in China in 2019, according to data from the report. As shown in the table above, most Chinese new passenger cars were pre-installed with ultrasonic solutions for automated parking in 2019 while ultrasonic + vision fusion solution only held tiny shares but saw an uptrend from the fourth quarter. The moderate assembly rate of automated parking results from the limited scenarios of traditional ultrasonic parking solutions where the driver has to stay in the car. To tackle this problem, there are two ways: better performance of ultrasonic radars and more sensors (such as cameras and millimeter-wave radars). For instance, the AionS Automated Parking System, which was launched by GAC in the first half of 2019, uses 12 Bosch sixth-generation ultrasonic radars to detect a longer range than the previous generation and probe objects as close as 3cm instead of the original 6cm with faster refresh and agility.",SAIC,en,Benzinga
