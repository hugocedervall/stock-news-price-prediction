2020-12-09 17:16:49-05:00,Here’s why you’ll need to wear a mask even after you get vaccinated,"People who will receive coronavirus vaccines will still be advised to wear face masks for the foreseeable future, as researchers are looking to determine whether vaccination can prevent infection and whether immunized people could still be infectious to non-vaccinated people. The current lineup of vaccine candidates will not prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2, as they’re meant to reduce the severity of the illness and the risk of complications. Vaccinated people might still be infected with the virus in their nose, where the pathogen could replicate to large enough levels before antibodies clear it to be dangerous to non-vaccinated people. Surviving coronavirus doesn't mean you should stop wearing a mask. COVID-19 immunity research data shows that most people will develop a robust immune response, but some still risk reinfection. The same goes for vaccines. Drugs like the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have an efficacy rating of around 95% at preventing severe illness. But the immunity kicks in a few days after the first shot, and the best protection is attained a few days after the second injection.",JNJ,en,BGR

""There's an increasing expectation [from consumers] that brands have shared values and purpose —that's what drives loyalty and engagement."" KitchenAid isn't alone. The rising adoption of over-the-top streaming, growth of purpose-driven marketing, and increase in ad-skipping had led more brands to get on the documentary bandwagon. For instance: Brands including Nike, Johnson & Johnson, HP , and 23andMe have made documentaries in the past few years.

Thanks to positive vaccine news, the S&P 500 rose nearly 11% to deliver some of its best gains in the past 30 years while out-of-favor value stocks staged a massive comeback from their underperformance in the last decade or more. Since Pfizer's early November announcement that its vaccine had a 90%+ efficacy rate , Goldman Sachs' long/short value factor, which underperformed for most of the last four years, has surged 12% as of December 3, according to a Monday client note. For investors who have missed the value train, there are still other opportunities that have lagged the market but are well-positioned for the post-pandemic economy. Aside from cyclically oriented value stocks, S&P 500 dividend futures remain an attractive opportunity that trades at significant discounts, Chief US Equity Strategist David Kostin said in the note. While realized S&P 500 dividends per share fell by 5.6% year-over-year in the third quarter, many companies such as Darden Restaurants (DRI), Marathon Oil (MRO), and Estee Lauder (EL) that had suspended dividend payments earlier in the year due to COVID-19 impacts have now resumed, Kostin explained.","T,JNJ",en,Business Insider

But much of the world, outside of rich nations like the U.S., is counting on another company’s shot to escape the crisis.Findings from the final stage of AstraZeneca Plc’s vaccine studies are due to be released shortly, and the stakes for lower- and middle-income nations are immense. The shot developed with the University of Oxford accounts for more than 40% of the supplies going to those countries, based on deals tracked by London-based research firm Airfinity Ltd.The Astra vaccine costs a fraction of the price set by Pfizer and will be manufactured in multiple countries, from India to Brazil. It should be easier to deploy far and wide than other shots that need to be stored at ultra-cold temperatures. But if the U.K. partners can’t match the lofty efficacy levels Pfizer and Moderna delivered or roll out their inoculation quickly, the pandemic might continue spreading death and disease in countries relying on it.“There’s a lot riding on the Astra vaccine,” said Suerie Moon, co-director of the Global Health Centre at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva.",JNJ,en,Economic Times India

It encourages states and governors to band together and implement restrictions “focus[ed] on known sources of spread, such as bars and nightclubs.” Drs. Gottlieb and McClellan’s plea sounds reasonable. After all, ‘the science’ tells us that Covid spreads in confined spaces. Basing policy advice on ‘the science’ would be the sensible thing to do. These spaces — the restaurants, bars and cafes we enjoy — must be closed for our protection. But there’s just one small problem: ‘the science’ isn’t really there.

The decision on procuring the right COVID-19 vaccine depends on multiple factors, including safety, price and ease of deployment, the scientists added, pitching for a preventive like the one being developed by US firm Novavax that can be stored at lower temperatures rather than those developed from mRNA or viral vectors. That would potentially rule out the three vaccine candidates that have shown over 90 per cent efficiency over the last few days -- Pfizer-BioNtech with 90 per cent efficacy in Phase 3 trial interim results, Sputnik V with 92 per cent and Moderna with 94.5 per cent - raising hopes across the globe that a preventive is on the horizon. While none of them are protein-based, the one from US biotechnology company Moderna is perhaps the most suitable for Indian conditions because it doesn't need the extreme low temperatures that the others do.",JNJ,en,Economic Times India

Last week, Pfizer announced its super cold vaccine was 90% effective at preventing COVID-19 infections. Then on Monday, Moderna chimed in with its latest trial results , showing that shot (which can be kept in the fridge for a month ) is 94.5% effective. But, don't roll up your sleeves and ready your arm for a needle just yet, or start trashing your face masks. It will still take many more months for healthcare providers to insert these new shots into enough members of the general public to make a dent in the pandemic. Here are the key milestones to watch out for. First, the FDA needs to grant Emergency Use Authorization Pfizer and Moderna don't get to decide when their shots go on the market. First, they both need to pass muster with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Dr. Peter Marks, who runs the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, where coronavirus vaccines are reviewed, recently told Business Insider that the process of reviewing Pfizer and Moderna's applications for Emergency Use Authorization, fast-tracking the shots into clinics, will still take ""weeks.""

Por eso Ursula von der Leyen , presidenta de la Comisión Europea, anunció durante su discurso del estado de la Unión de 2020 ante el Parlamento Europeo, que Bruselas perseguiría poner las primeras piedras de una Unión de la Salud que ayudará a la UE a gestionar mejor las crisis sanitarias en el futuro a una escala europea. “En tiempos de crisis, los ciudadanos esperan con razón que la UE asuma un papel más activo” Y es lo que ha querido hacer hoy el Ejecutivo comunitario, tras la adopción de una serie de propuestas que han sido presentadas por Stella Kyriakides, comisaria de Salud. “En tiempos de crisis, los ciudadanos esperan con razón que la UE asuma un papel más activo ”, ha señalado la chipriota, que sabe de lo que habla: muchos miraron a Bruselas en los primeros compases de la pandemia, cuando en realidad Bruselas poco podía hacer.",JNJ,es,El Confidencial

S&P emini futures were last up 0.1%, extending a rally in Wednesday's stock market trading session. Nasdaq 100 emini futures rose 0.5%. Democratic candidate Joe Biden predicted a U.S. election win over President Donald Trump after pivotal victories in Michigan and Wisconsin, while the Republican incumbent sought to offset a narrowing path to re-election with lawsuits and demands for a recount. Both Trump and Biden still had paths to reach the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win as states kept counting mail-in ballots. However, Trump now has fewer options to secure a second four-year term. A surprise win by Republican Senator Susan Collins in Maine dimmed hopes by Democrats that they could get control of the U.S. Senate.

By stopping symptoms, the vaccine would prevent severe illnesses and save lives. Preventing COVID-19 infections entirely is a secondary goal for early vaccine candidates, Fauci said. About half a dozen novel coronavirus vaccine candidates are in the final stage of trials, and a few of them will have conclusions ready in the coming weeks . Hopefully, more than one of these experimental drugs will turn out to be safe and effective against COVID-19 so that emergency vaccination campaigns can begin. But there’s no guarantee that any of the Phase 3 trials will be successful, and we have plenty of examples of drugs that have failed in COVID-19 experiments so far. The first COVID-19 vaccines won’t be 100% effective either, which means people who are vaccinated will still have to take precautions to avoid contracting the illness for as long as possible.",JNJ,en,BGR

US regulators approved the virus-fighting drug remdesivir on Thursday, greenlighting its use in hospitalized patients. The US Food and Drug Administration had given an emergency OK for the drug's use in May. But it's unclear how well remdesivir, marketed as Veklury, works for patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Studies respectively led by the US National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization came to conflicting conclusions, with the WHO research casting doubt on the drug's benefits. ""It has an effect, but it doesn't really have an amazing effect that people were hoping it would have,"" Dr. Walid Gellad, director for the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing at the University of Pittsburgh, told Business Insider in a Friday phone interview. In squaring the findings of the main studies on remdesivir, longtime drug discovery researcher Derek Lowe wrote that ""for remdesivir, it looks like the argument now is 'Does it help a bit or just not at all?'"" Despite that uncertainty, one thing is clear: Remdesivir's manufacturer, the California biotech giant Gilead Sciences, is in a prime position to sell billions of dollars worth of the drug.",JNJ,en,Business Insider

The debate took place under health and safety protocols in force due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and was moderated by Kristen Welker of NBC news. Welker appealed to the two candidates to speak one at a time as the debate started — and found a lot more success in getting Trump and Biden to not speak over each other than Fox News anchor Chris Wallace did in the first debate. New rules were announced for the 90-minute debate this week, which required both Trump and Biden’s microphones to be on mute while the other contestant made opening remarks.

A noted epidemiologist recently said that the next three months will be the ""darkest of the entire pandemic."" With colder weather approaching, experts are anticipating a huge increase in new coronavirus cases. Over the weekend, more than a dozen states reported a record number of new coronavirus infections. As the coronavirus continues to spread like wildfire across the country, it's become overwhelmingly clear that the world isn't going to return to normal for quite some time. If anything, the next few weeks, according to medical experts, could prove to be worse than anything we've seen yet. Especially with colder weather already hitting most areas of the country, not to mention the arrival of flu season, it stands to reason that we're going to see a massive spike in new coronavirus infections and associated deaths over the next 2-3 months. To this point, Michael Osterholm, a prominent infectious disease doctor who works at the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said that the next 6 to 12 weeks ""are going to be the darkest of the entire pandemic.""

Extraordinary policy measures from governments around the world helped stem the decline in stocks since the initial February decline, but underlying economic conditions remain weak and the future outlook is highly uncertain, the IMF said. Investor worry over a potential prolonged COVID-19 pandemic could have been heightened on Tuesday after Johnson & Johnson paused its phase III vaccine trial due to an unexpected illness. As long as investor optimism over easy fiscal and monetary policy continues, stocks can stay elevated for some time, but a significantly delayed economic recovery due to the persistence of COVID-19 could put a serious dent in that optimism, according to the IMF.

Johnson & Johnson did not disclose details about the patient or the illness, nor did it say whether the volunteer was on the experimental drug or a placebo. The company said that temporary pauses are standard for vaccine trials, and the FDA has not placed a regulatory hold on the study.

Just as Trump increased his vaccine rhetoric on the campaign trail , a new survey showed that more Americans are reluctant to get a vaccine when it becomes available.

There is a reason why the Goldman strategist may want to minimize the importance of the next 4 weeks, because as he admits, the consequences of the semi-frozen economy on an uneven road to recovery will be visible in 3Q results: consensus expects 3Q S&P 500 EPS will decline by 21% on a year/year basis, following a 32% drop in 2Q and a 15% fall in 1Q.","JPM,JNJ",en,Zero Hedge

While the timeline is aggressive because late-stage vaccine trials started just a few months ago, Pfizer's CEO has repeatedly said he expects results in October.

It's far from certain that any vaccine will have results so early.

Researchers are targeting efficacy of at least 60% for the drugs, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, which is the standard for vaccines. The Operation Warp Speed leader thinks COVID-19 vaccine efficacy will end up being much higher than that — potentially higher than 90% — which is the most optimistic prediction so far. At least three vaccine efforts have reached Phase 3 clinical trials in America and Europe, which is the last stage of human testing for new drugs. If successful, the vaccine candidates from Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, and AstraZeneca/Oxford could receive emergency use authorization this year, as early as October and November . This would allow officials in charge of local COVID-19 management policies to initiate immunization protocols, with high-risk people likely to be the first to receive vaccines. Healthcare workers and other frontline personnel who can be exposed to the virus, as well as older people who are likely to develop complications after infection, could be among the first to be inoculated with the final versions of vaccines.",JNJ,en,BGR

Content moderation has become a top priority for social platforms — including Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Pinterest, and LinkedIn — amid rising public and political scrutiny and escalating content-related crises. Brands, lawmakers, and even social media execs are coming to grips with the reality that platforms are not up to the task of moderating content on their own, primarily due to their massive scale. The scale of the problem — and the difficulty of fixing it — roughly correlate with the scale of platforms themselves. Even if 99% of harmful content is removed from a large platform, an enormous amount can still remain. Even leadership at social platforms believe their platforms should have oversight from external stakeholders, with some either publicly stating that belief or privately meeting with regulators.",JNJ,en,Business Insider

Some experts say reaching that target may be challenging, because vaccines require a lot of testing. One worry is ""immune enhancement,"" normally spotted in animal testing, whereby a vaccine actually weakens a person's response to the virus. It can take 10 years or more to bring a vaccine from the starting block to being approved by regulators. The FDA says, in this case, it will be flexible to accommodate approval for a workable COVID-19 virus vaccine. 40 vaccines for the coronavirus are in development right now, according to the World Health Organization. A number of labs have begun human trials. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories .

California has the most cancer labels of any US state because of Proposition 65 , a law that requires anything with even a loose link to cancer to be labeled by the state. A panel of scientists will decide in spring 2020 whether or not the substance will be considered a carcinogen by the state. No existing studies have firmly linked the chemical to cancer.

Acetaminophen — a common ingredient used in over-the-counter painkillers like Tylenol, Excedrin, and Midol — might be given a cancer warning label in California, adding to the state's growing list of 900 chemicals considered carcinogens. Also known as paracetamol, acetaminophen has been available without a prescription since the 1950s. It is usually used to treat migraines, muscle aches, and to reduce fevers.

The fund managers outlined which thematic and single-stock strategies paid off for them this year, and they laid out their top trades and ideas for 2020. If you followed only financial-news headlines in 2019, you might assume the market had a tough year. Recession fears flared, trade-war tensions ebbed and flowed with ferocity, and corporate earnings growth slowed. Yet the benchmark S&P 500 was still up 19% year-to-date through the end of September. Thank the Federal Reserve and its overt willingness to continuing stimulating an economic expansion that's already the longest in history. But even amid a robust market environment that saw every major stock index climb for the year, a handful of fund managers stood out as the cream of the crop.

On December 3, as part of Johnson and Johnson's latest effort to prove the safety of its products, more tests showed that the baby powder was free of asbestos.

Click here for more BI Prime stories . Recession anxiety has been one of the defining market themes of 2019. The yield-curve inversion , trade war, and even the sheer record length of this expansion gave investors jitters about a downturn that has so far failed to materialize. Investors were naturally concerned that companies with the weakest credit ratings and largest piles of debt would run into the most trouble. Amid this anxiety, managers of the Goldman Sachs Income Builder Fund saw an opportunity to lean into corporate credit; the fund invests in a mix of credit and equities. But it wasn't just any debt: they were focused on companies that had demonstrated they can generate strong cash flow and pay down their debt.

""This bottle … [is] really good at holding ketchup, but what they didn't really think about was how to get the ketchup out of the bottle,"" Mullins said, according to Pedersen. ""There's a process involved. First you have to turn the bottle upside down; then you might have to hold it at about a 45-degree angle; then tap on the 57 [on the neck of the bottle]; then you get out a knife and start trying to pull out the ketchup; then you give it a shake; and the final step of the process is to clean off your shirt.""

New tools including vaccines have helped contain the outbreak, second only to the 2013-16 West African outbreak that killed more than 11,300, despite public mistrust and conflict affecting the response in parts of the region. The new vaccine, which has passed clinical trials but has never been tested in a real-world setting, will be administered to 50,000 people in Goma, a city of two million on the Rwandan border, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said in a statement. The vaccine, which requires two injections eight weeks apart, will be rolled out alongside another manufactured by Merck, which only requires a single shot. The Merck vaccine has been administered to over 250,000 people since the start of the outbreak in August 2018. “The introduction of a second vaccine is not meant to replace [Merck’s] vaccine, but to complement it and hopefully provide us with an additional tool in the fight against future Ebola outbreaks,” said John Johnson, who is leading the project for MSF.",JNJ,en,AfricaNews

The global health outfit said there is sufficient evidence that shows that the vaccine is effective. Ervebo effectively becomes the world’s first ever drug aimed at prevention of Ebola. According to standards, a WHO prequalification is granted to a trial medication only after a drug passes important safety and efficacy tests. Experts have hailed the development as a crucial step that will accelerate access to and deployment in countries most exposed to Ebola epidemics. The announcement follows the European Commission’s decision on Monday to authorise the marketing of this vaccine manufactured by the US laboratory Merck Sharpe and Dohme (MSD).

On Wednesday, an experts’ panel set up by the government finalised the terms of a legally binding compensation formula which will be recommended to the health ministry for incorporation in the Drugs and Cosmetics (D&C) Act, people aware of the matter told ET.India so far did not have legal provisions to compensate patients who suffer serious side effects due to use of medical devices. The law mandates compensation only when something goes wrong during a clinical trial.According to the formula finalised by the nine-member medical devices sub-committee, compensation will be determined on the basis of parameters like the base amount, loss of wages, and the degree of disability, the persons cited earlier said, requesting not to be named. The panel is headed by former director general of health services (DGHS), BD Athani.“If the disability is higher, permanent and the patient is young, the compensation is higher,” said one of the persons cited earlier.The experts have suggested a composition of “causality assessment committee” to determine if the adverse event happened due to the manufacturing defect of the medical device or otherwise.In case of imported devices, the liability to pay compensation will fall on the Indian agent licensed to sell the product.",JNJ,en,The Economic Times India

2019-04-26 07:45:00-05:00,Exclusive Licensing Gives Biologics CROs Major Advantage,"NEW YORK , April 26, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Biopharma companies rise and fall on the back of research and development. Success in the biopharma industry has always been about patents. The exclusive right to market life-saving treatments is how all the industry titans made their names. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE ) both amped up on R&D and the ensuing patents. As such, companies rise and fall on these developments, and can spend months, if not years, researching, developing, and testing a new compound. When they're successful, these major breakthroughs can be worth billions in revenue for those who commercialize these drugs. Many biopharma companies, such as, AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV ), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE: TMO ), and ImmunoPrecise Antibodies Ltd (OTCQB: IPATF ) (TSXV: IPA ), are hitting home runs in the pharmaceutical discovery process, which lands them lucrative and exclusive contracts with big pharma. As major firms continue to search for new potential proprietary breakthroughs, they have begun to recognize the value in outsourcing this process to smaller, more specialized companies.",JNJ,en,Benzinga

Potentially incentivized by a new study on the monoclonal antibody therapy market, analysts recently projected a double-digit 10.5% CAGR by 2022, and revenues to touch $140 billion . Driving this surge is the development of new therapeutic drugs from Big Pharma giants such as AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV ), Pfizer Inc.
