2020-04-14 14:16:00-05:00,Why Empty Office Buildings Still Consume Lots of Power During a Global Pandemic,"What happens to an office building’s electricity demand when almost everyone who works there is stuck at home? The coronavirus pandemic has forced broad swaths of the economy to shut down, as state after state forced non-essential businesses to close. The result has been significant drops in electricity demand in big commercial centers like New York City and the San Francisco Bay Area , and forecasts that commercial energy usage across the country will decline by 4.7 pecent this year . But just because a building is almost empty of people doesn’t mean that its energy use drops to nothing. Shutting down key building systems like heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) can lead to unhealthy air or corrosion in boilers and chillers. Emergency lighting and elevators must remain on, as must the servers running the business tasks being done by employees at home. Any equipment that was left plugged in when the office closed will still be using standby power. Office building energy consumption fell steadily through March and into early April, but it did not fall off a cliff, according to Hatch Data, which monitors 400 million square feet of commercial real estate for more than 250 clients.",JCI,en,Green Technology

We're not talking about complex gadgets with crazy sensors you need a Ph.D. to figure out. We're talking about simple, no-brainer purchases that make your life better with minimal effort. An Alexa smart speaker like the Echo Dot is on the list, of course, as is a smart plug (these Wi-Fi smart plugs are on sale for just $6.75 each). At the very tippy-top of the list, however, is a smart thermostat — and today is the day you're finally going to get one. If you're not too familiar with smart thermostats and you're wondering what makes a smart thermostat like a Nest a must-have, we can sum it up for you in four words: it saves you money. By using smart programming that adjusts and adapts instead of static schedules each day, a smart thermostat can dramatically cut down the amount of time your heating and cooling systems are on.
