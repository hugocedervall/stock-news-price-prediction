A day at Vail Resorts, that is, if you rent skis and purchase a lift ticket, could cost upwards of $300 per day. And that doesn't include lodging! All said and done, a heavily indebted consumer, or let's say a broke millennial, could spend upwards of $500 per day on ski rental, lift ticket, and lodging (ex. food expenses).

The consumer has had to make some tough choices at the start of the 2020 ski season – it comes down to debt servicing payments, like student debt, auto loans, and credit cards, or experience a weekend at Vail. The holiday hangover, where consumers loaded up their credit cards with holiday purchases, might be another reason why they can't afford to ski. The exact causes are unknown.
