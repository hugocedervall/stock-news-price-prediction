The three year-deal is estimated at close to Rs 15 crore, said two executives with knowledge of the matter.Sports marketing and talent management firm Rhiti Group chairman Arun Pandey, who represents one of India’s most successful captains, confirmed the deal but declined to comment on financials.“MS Dhoni has signed a multi-year endorsement deal with Coca-Cola’s Powerade. He has over 30 brand associations presently,” Pandey said.A Coca-Cola spokesperson could not be reached for comment.In 2016, Coca-Cola’s rival PepsiCo and Dhoni had ended their 11-year highprofile association, which had seen the cricketer endorse both Pepsi Cola and Lay’s chips, including being the face of big campaigns such as 'Oh Yes Abhi' and 'Change The Game’.The relatively smaller functional sports drinks market is gaining popularity and according to one of the officials mentioned above, Coca-Cola has planned a multimedia campaign featuring Dhoni and Powerade, which competes directly with PepsiCo’s Gatorade.The 37-year-old India wicket keeperbatsman’s brand value and endorsements have seen a resurgence over the past two years, after a decline soon after he quit Test cricket in 2014.Industry experts are of the opinion that Dhoni, widely believed to be playing his last World Cup, is a brand that has revived with a differentiated niche that contrasts with that of his successor.“MSD is now the sedate, suave persona of Indian cricket — to that extent he is the antithesis of Virat Kohli,” said brand specialist and consultant Harish Bijoor.“There are brands that need both these types of personas—brash and aggressive, and suave and the silent.",GDDY,en,The Economic Times India
