2020-12-09 19:25:00-05:00,A $1.1 Trillion Boost: Why JPM Sees Stocks Rising As Much As 25% Next Year,"A $1.1 Trillion Boost: Why JPM Sees Stocks Rising As Much As 25% Next Year Tyler Durden Wed, 12/09/2020 - 19:25 Back in July we showed that in the most typical of Wall Street CYA positions , JPMorgan was bullish, bearish and neutral on stocks all at the same time. This appears to have continued into year end because just last week, JPMorgan's chief equity strategist Mislav Matejka cut his view of US stocks, downgrading the US to neutral (while upgrading Europe to Overweight). This was around the time JPM also unveiled its 2021 year-end price target for the S&P at 4,400, but came just as stocks swooned lower for a few hours perhaps explaining the sudden onset of bearishness. In short, anyone trying to figure out what JPM really thinks may want to take a deep breath, and simply look at what the market is doing any any given moment to decipher what JPMorgan thinks. In any case, with the S&P hitting an all time high above 3,700 on Tuesday (ahead of today's sharp correction, which may lead to an entirely different hot take from JPMorgan's crack strategist) one would be correct in assuming that any research reports out of JPMorgan published yesterday would be super bullish (after all, JPM has to convince as many clients as possible to buy whatever JPMorgan's prop desk has to sell to them), and sure enough in the latest note from JPMorgan's Nick Panigirtzoglou the bulls got yet another ""justification"" to keep buying stocks at all time highs.",JPM,en,Zero Hedge

David Perdue is poised to raise big campaign money with federal lobbyists who represent 10 companies whose stock shares he's recently bought or sold, according to a fundraising event invitation obtained by Insider. Five Washington, DC, lobbyists listed as host committee members for the December 9 ""virtual fundraiser"" together count among their paid clients Amazon, Verizon, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, the Bank of New York Mellon, tobacco giant Altria and computer technology company Oracle, according to congressional lobbying records.

According to a recent survey from Bank of America, half of fund managers favour emerging markets more than any other asset class for 2021. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has risen by nearly 13 per cent in November. Emerging market debt is also growing in popularity, with EPFR data showing flows of USD3.5 billion into EM bonds during one week in November, the fourth largest weekly inflows ever. “EMD remains a relatively popular asset class for institutional investors globally,” writes the emerging markets debt team of US asset manager Eaton Vance. “The irony, however, is that fund flows in the sector are still driven by index-based strategies that ignore fundamentals, even as many investors have come to recognise just how crucial individual EM country fundamentals will be in surmounting Covid-19 challenges.” Benchmark-based approaches “may be sub-optimal”, warns Eaton Vance, adding that indexes are often highly concentrated, with ten countries accounting for 80 per cent of JP Morgan’s Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets’ index weighting.",JPM,en,InstitutionAlassetManager

Viswanathan previously served as the bank's chief administrative officer overseeing technology and operations in corporate and investment banking. Talks of Chase's UK venture started in August, and while the bank hasn't commented on its UK plans, both this key appointment and Financial Conduct Authority filings indicate that it remains in progress. This will be Chase's second attempt at a digital-only offshoot after shuttering its Finn app in the US last year. The millennial-geared service was discontinued in June 2019, just a year after its national rollout. Finn failed to differentiate its offerings from Chase's flagship mobile app enough to attract its own audience: It was built on top of the same backend infrastructure as the bank's main mobile banking app, and the two looked very similar. Chase doesn't have a presence in the UK yet, so it won't run into that issue with its new endeavor—though it also won't have strong brand recognition to fall back on.",JPM,en,Business Insider

Furthermore, with the US entering 2021 without any firm commitment for another much needed round of fiscal stimulus - which we hope everyone realizes is the only reason why the economy did not disintegrate in the summer and fall - even as the rising number of covid cases continue to dominate the economic outlook, the time for the realization that a double dip is imminent, was drawing close.",JPM,en,Zero Hedge

Recently when I was trying to setup an ESG themed Model Portfolio on a platform for a new client, I was told that I could not include UBS’s EM ESG Diversified Bond ETF because the backend gatekeeper had decreed that access to this fund was not an option – and neither were any other EM ESG Bond ETFs. UBS was the first ETF provider to trailblaze the ESG cause in the Corporate Bond space, and with that innovative step it became much easier to design a family of Multi-Asset ESG ETF Model Portfolios. UBS’s decision to build out their ESG credentials must have been a hard-won battle at times and one can only imagine how they will react when they realize that on some adviser platforms the ‘computer says no’!",JPM,en,Wealth Adviser

The suit alleges that Visa withheld $66,000 in payments, fined MNG $25,000, and cut off transactions involving the business after wrongly determining that it was involved in illegal activities. The defendants had filed several motions to have the claims dismissed, but U.S. District Judge John A. Ross ruled Monday that the CBD chain can sue Visa for unjust enrichment and defamation.

According to Reuters , the deal is the second-biggest banking-sector deal since the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The combined bank will have nearly $560 billion of assets and operate in more than two dozen states. The move underscores how a loosening of financial regulations and lowering of corporate taxes under President Donald Trump has emboldened regional lenders to try and compete with JPM by joining forces with other smaller rivals.

The Q3 decline owes to consumers and businesses resuming payments as the economy began to reopen and social distancing measures eased in many regions. But spiking coronavirus infection rates across the US have raised concerns that the dip in deferrals could only be temporary. US banks pulled back on loan loss provisions across the board in Q3, suggesting confidence in customers' improving financial situations—but gauging the level of risk they face remains a challenge. Bank of America (BofA), Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and JPMorgan Chase have taken more than $62 billion in charges in total for future loan losses this year, largely in the first two quarters, per the FT. They tapered back their allocations in Q3, as more customers exited deferral programs and resumed regular payments: BofA, for example, set aside $1.39 billion for loan losses in Q3, far lower than the $5.12 billion it allocated in Q2.",JPM,en,Business Insider

"" To reach its ""startling"" conclusion, JPMorgan compared countries without lockdown, keeping the economy open under certain levels of social-distancing (Brazil, US, Sweden, Japan, Korea) to countries with strong curve intervention (UK, Germany, Italy, France, China, India) to see any meaningful differential in the curve development.",JPM,en,Zero Hedge

Some may be stuck in pilot phases , unable to figure out how to expand initiatives across the enterprise. Others may run into cultural challenges, like overly-broad ambitions or a reluctance from middle-management to embrace change .

As the CEO of a company that offers AI-backed software tailored to industries like oil and gas, banking, and manufacturing, Siebel has a first-hand view into companies' struggles, which he blames on the fact that corporations ""most frequently attempt to build the applications themselves with their own IT organization"" instead of enlisting outside help. ""Probably 99 out of 100 are failing and they're all internal build projects that involve sometimes hundreds of thousands of programmers,"" he said.

The meeting ended without a discussion of Ant’s IPO, but it was a sign that things might not go as planned.The subsequent unraveling of the $35 billion share sale has thrust Ma’s fintech giant into turmoil, offering a stark reminder that even China’s most celebrated businessman isn’t immune to the whims of a Communist Party that under Xi Jinping has steadily tightened its grip on the world’s second-largest economy.Among the questions that linger as international investors try to make sense of a chaotic 72 hours: Why would China scuttle Ant’s IPO at the last minute after months of meticulous preparation?",JPM,en,Yahoo Finance

Crisis yes, maybe even a touch of market turmoil for a few weeks in March, but never something that would embroil the world’s mightiest financial institutions, the way that subprime mortgages embroiled them 12 years before. So starting in March, a series of emergency measures were rolled out that temporarily eliminated or blunted restrictions on bank balance sheets, along with ramped up support for financial markets that in the US at least, was unprecedented. Risky Finance joined forces with Washington DC-based advocacy group Americans for Financial Reform to analyze some of the impact on the six biggest US banks.

You can read more about the incident here. What is more interesting is that the JPM report also laid out the bank's latest quarter of market scenarios, and what we find notable is that here too, there appears to be some political bias… only in the opposite direction, because unlike most of Wall Street, JPM sees a Blue Wave as the worst possible case, a split presidency/Congress as status quo, and a Red Wave as the best possible outcome, one which would push the S&P to 3,900.",JPM,en,Zero Hedge

Once seen as scrappy disruptors, fintechs have established themselves as a serious threat. For a majority of Americans, these consumer apps have become a key part of their financial lives. From peer-to-peer transfers to new forms of credit and no-fee bank accounts, fintechs run the gamut of personal-finance products. But the startup revolution hasn't occurred entirely independently. Fintechs still need banks, or at the very least, the data stored inside them. With many of their customers maintaining accounts at traditional financial firms, fintechs need to be able to connect and share information with their much larger peers. That's where companies like Plaid and Envestnet's Yodlee come in. These data aggregators sit in the middle, connecting third-party apps to various banks' systems. But in recent years banks have raised questions about the efficacy of these data aggregators, challenging their security practices or pushing to deny their access altogether .",JPM,en,Business Insider

JPMorgan, the nation's largest bank, said in a note Friday to expect a ""couple of painful months ahead"" and lowered its oil-price estimate for the fourth quarter from $41 a barrel to $39. When markets opened on Tuesday, Brent crude, the international price benchmark, was trading at about $39 a barrel, down 10% from its October high. The recent drop in oil prices coincides with new lockdowns in Europe that constrict travel, the analysts said.

Goldman Sachs said only ‘in-office essential’ employees would be allowed to work from its London office after UK PM Boris Johnson announced the new lockdown measures. This represents a remarkable shift from where the bank stood in September, when it started to quietly move staff back to the office. To be sure, Goldman in-office essential employees represents a tiny fraction of the bank's 5,000 workers in London. Deutsche Bank, on the other hand, has said that employees who are eligible to continue working from DB's UK offices will receive an email Monday evening with instructions.",JPM,en,Zero Hedge

So does that mean the correction is over? That's the question Wilson asks in his latest note to clients, and answers that ""the short answer is that the worst of the correction is over in our view but we still think the next month is likely to remain volatile and uncertain as we navigate what is shaping up to be a much closer election than expected just a few weeks ago and risk of further lockdowns as the virus runs its course.""

Collectively, homeowners age 62 and older have a record $6.5 trillion of “tappable” equity, according to data analytics firm Black Knight.

SEE MORE How Can I Deduct Home-Equity Interest Under the New Tax Law? Many financial planners believe tapping that wealth in retirement or just before makes sense if done wisely for the right reasons. For instance, the money can be used for some laudable goals: to pay off higher-priced credit card deb t, remodel a home with features to help you age in place , delay taking Social Security until you qualify for the maximum payout, buy long-term care insurance or pay the tax bill for a Roth conversion .

This is what Goldman said then: Health concerns and social distancing protocols suggest that more voters than ever will decide not to cast ballots at traditional polling stations on Election Day and instead vote by mail .

While the curve is again starting to edge up, it's not to critical levels. In an attempt to reconcile the curve’s persisting beyond year-end, JPMorgan's MW Kim presents several potential 2021 scenarios. Noting further progress in vaccine/treatment, the strategist highlights: the mortality rate could decline below 2% by 1H21E; infections could be less clustered, sporadic and perhaps smaller-scale in third/fourth waves; lockdowns may decline as a primary response in 2021 due to their economic burden, rising public stress on social distancing, and fiscal budget limitations.",JPM,en,Zero Hedge

I am an Enemy to all banks discounting bills, or notes for anything but Coin. If the American People allow private banks to control the issuance of their currency, first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the People of all their Property until their Children will wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered.” – Thomas Jefferson. (1743-1826). If we look at just one example of “depriving the People of their Property” as Jefferson stated, the consequences for the ordinary man are devastating.

The biggest investors in the space, such as JPMorgan, Bank of America, or USBank, would have less tax liability to dedicate to solar investments. But the full story is more nuanced. Less tax equity available for projects is certainly a concern. But heightened competition for tax equity and a growing solar industry are the more critical drivers.

The management of the resources company and its bankers seem to believe technical glitches on the exchange platform did them in. But Asia’s oldest bourse differs.The spat has drawn Sebi’s attention, which is likely to ask BSE to verify the source of 120 million unconfirmed bids and whether the bids were genuine or there was any foul play as alleged by some shareholders. That caused wild swings in the stock price besides fueling confusion, according to people aware of the development.The bids on the Reverse Book Building (RBB) window from the institutional investors have to be confirmed by custodians after placing those bids and are kept in the unconfirmed window. It is possible that some bids remain unconfirmed due to technical reasons and are not considered for the purpose of determining the book.However, in this case, the quantum of 120 million unconfirmed bids until the end of the delisting closing period has stumped market analysts, and the quantity was significant enough to create a distorted market for bids and had a material impact on the stock price movement.Although the total bids received were around 1.37 billion, the demand schedule released by the BSE showed only 1.25 billion confirmed bids against the 1.34 billion shares required for successful delisting.Market participants have raised question marks over the purpose behind such unconfirmed quantity which has resulted in many shareholders getting trapped in the Vedanta counter.“Sebi should immediately probe those investors whose bids were not confirmed and whether these bids were backed by an adequate number of shares or whether these bidders had sold their shares in the open market,” said J N Gupta, founder, Stakeholder Empowerment Services. “The bids on RBB and the resultant statements from key stakeholders created a misleading picture of the entire situation.",JPM,en,Economic Times India

Three months later, in September, JPM chimed in with a counter-narrative that a contested election was the ""worst case scenario for the market into year end."" All of this culminated last week when in a rapidly-cobbled together consensus, Wall Street concluded that not only is a contested election unlikely but that a Democratic Sweep - and thus higher corporate taxes - is actually good for stocks. And then, just to assure investors that no matter what happens - even a massive increase in the top long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 39.6% under the Biden admin - they shouldn't sell, JPMorgan came out with a late Friday report according to which while a spike in cap gains taxes could be negative for market in late 2021, it would have little to no impact over the long-run.",JPM,en,Zero Hedge

Today Mr. Rudd is President of the Asia Society Policy Institute in New York. In an in-depth conversation via Zoom, he explains why a fundamental competition has begun between the two great powers. He would not rule out a hot war: «We know from history that it is easy to start a conflict, but it is bloody hard to end it», he warns.

""After a holiday in 2017 we were hit by annoying bank fees and we said, 'We want to be able to pay from our bank account without getting slammed from charges,'"" Goulding said.

But while most have forgotten Trump's dismal polling in 2016, when the NYT declared Hillary's chances of victory at 92% just days before the election, everyone remembers what happened on Nov 8, 2016, even if the NYT and the entire polling industry would like to forget. And yet, despite this clear lesson from the very recent past that polling and political prediction markets are total garbage, we are going through all the motions again, and as JPMorgan's ""other"" quant, Nick Panagirtzoglou writes in the latest Flows and Liquidity report, ""markets have been factoring in greater probability of Biden winning the election"" which naturally ""implies that a potential Trump win would constitute a big surprise for markets""… just like in 2016.",JPM,en,Zero Hedge

The reason for that is that while confusion and chaos raged during last night's debate, Trump made one thing clear: the president declined to commit outright to accepting the results, repeating a recurring complaint that mail-in ballots would lead to election fraud. ""The debate drew further attention to the potential for a contested election,” said Hani Redha, global multi-asset portfolio manager, at Pinebridge. ""It is likely market participants will continue to price in this issue, heightening volatility all the way to election day and its immediate aftermath.""

But things weren't always this way. Before the financial crisis, and before regulators around the world started scrutinizing banks' derivatives businesses to try and curb risk. But while Deutsche Bank has become the poster-child for post-GFC decline - as its ambitions to become a global rival to JP Morgan crumbled to dust - Societe Generale, the French banking giant that reaped massive profits during the late 1990s and 2000s via its pioneering 'structured products' business, is also presiding over the twilight of a business line that was once the bank's profit center, but has been blamed for massive losses during the coronavirus downturn this spring. Oudea As the FT reminds us , the French bank fell to a shocking loss of €326 millions ($380 million) in the first quarter after revenue in its equity trading unit (long hailed as a key strength) collapsed almost 99% to just €9 million ($10.5 million) after the bank saw ""the worst environment you can imagine"" for its structured products business, CEO Frédéric Oudéa explained.",JPM,en,Zero Hedge

In analysts' eyes, the stock could still have a 60% upside. But that doesn't mean things will be easy.

Collectively, the 10 banks that served as underwriters for the IPO pocketed a cool $105 million in fees.

And that's putting a spotlight on how exactly they're thinking about their sprawling networks of physical branches. Speaking at the Barclays Global Financial Services Conference on Tuesday, Brian Moynihan, Bank of America's CEO; and Jennifer Piepszak, JPMorgan's CFO, both made mentions of the increasing reliance on digital banking tools. There were signs in their remarks that the digital-adoption surge could change the calculus for how the two firms think about their retail footprint. JPMorgan Chase operates about 5,000 physical branches across the US, and Bank of America has roughly 4,300.

The admission came as part of a lengthy rebuttal on Monday to claims made by a short-seller last week that the electric-truck startup had garnered its soaring market valuation and deals with legacy automakers through numerous lies and other deceptions. ""The report from Hindenburg, an activist short-seller financially motivated to manipulate the market and profit from a manufactured decline in Nikola's stock price, contains a number of false and misleading statements regarding the Company's operations and multi-year, groundbreaking R&D efforts,"" the company said in a press release. After a brief stutter in early trading Monday, shares of Nikola made up some of their heavy losses from last week, climbing more than 7% following the company's response. As for the Nikola One truck, which Hindenburg Research claimed in its report was inoperable, the company offers a counterargument: ""Nikola described this third-party video on the Company's social media as 'In Motion,'"" the company said. ""It was never described as 'under its own propulsion' or 'powertrain driven.'"" Nikola claims that the truck was ""designed to be powered and driven by its own propulsion,"" but after pivoting to its newer Nikola Two prototype, the company opted to ""not to invest additional resources into completing the process to make the Nikola One drive on its own propulsion.""

Even for $119, Amazon Prime is still ultimately a great deal if you plan to use its features, whether sparingly or frequently. In 2018, JPMorgan estimated that an Amazon Prime membership is actually worth $785 annually . Prime members also get access to Amazon Prime Day 2020 deals once the event rolls this fall. If you're considering starting a free 30-day trial of Prime , right before Prime Day is a particularly good time to do it. Asking the question ""How much would you pay for Amazon Prime ?"" is kind of like asking how much would you pay to keep using Google .

In March, the company unveiled a quantum computer that surpassed the capabilities of Silicon Valley competitors like Google and announced JPMorgan Chase as an inaugural customer . Just days after that, COVID-19 began to quickly spread through the US and the company immediately ramped up production of face masks to help mitigate a shortage of the protective equipment in the early days of the crisis. In June, Honeywell announced a new partnership with SAP to help building managers automate aspects of their facilities. It also rolled-out an ultralight cleaning system to help airlines better sanitize planes in-between flights. Then, in August, the company was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average . Now, as Honeywell prepares to celebrate its 100th year as a publicly-traded company, Adamczyk has no plans to slow-down the firm's transformation from a manufacturing giant best-known for digital thermostats to a software powerhouse that can rival the offerings of firms like Salesforce.

The Indian conglomerate is looking to scale down its involvement in loss-making global subsidiaries and businesses, said several people aware of the matter. Among potential acquirers are Renault Samsung Motors (RSM) and Mahindra partner Ford Motor Co, said people familiar with the matter. However, the US company denied this. “Ford is not in discussion to buy a stake in SsangYong. We categorically deny and request you to keep Ford out of speculations as it impacts operations overseas,” the company said in an email. RSM didn’t respond to emails sent on Sunday.

An earlier attempt between January and March to regain control over paper gold markets has backfired on the bullion banks. Unallocated gold account holders with LBMA member banks will shortly discover that that market is trading on vapour. According to the Bank for International Settlements, at the end of last year LBMA gold positions, the vast majority being unallocated, totalled $512bn — the London Mythical Bullion Market is a more appropriate description for the surprise to come. An awful lot of gold bulls are going to be disappointed when their unallocated bullion bank holdings turn to dust in the coming months — perhaps it’s a matter of a few weeks, perhaps only days — and synthetic ETFs will also blow up.

Teladoc, a telehealth giant, and Livongo, a chronic care company, could actually deliver on that promise, David Larsen, an analyst at Verity Research, told investors in a note. Teladoc is buying Livongo in an $18.5 billion deal, a record for digital health. Wall Street thinks that Teladoc is paying too much for Livongo, and the company's stock declined when the deal was announced. Larsen said investors could be missing the upside. By combining, Teladoc and Livongo could become the ""virtual front door"" that the healthcare industry badly needs, he said. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories .

Shortly after, the bank also said it would raise its mortgage standards , stating that customers applying for a new mortgage will need a credit score of at least 700, and will be required to make a down payment equal to 20% of the home’s value, a dramatic tightening since the typical minimum requirement for a conventional mortgage is a 620 FICO score and as little as 5% down.",JPM,en,Zero Hedge

One of them showed a giant, fast-moving silver coin cutting the JP Morgan ‘paper tiger’ in half. For years, JPM had shorted silver and has been doing it illegally and collusively. I knew this, but I went ‘all in’ on silver anyway because I thought JPM would have to cover and spark a massive short squeeze. I was convinced my long positions would make me a fortune. Instead JPM drove the price of silver down from almost $50 early in 2011 all the way down to $13 just a few years later. Paper covered rock. Needless to say, I learned a hard lesson about putting all my eggs in a silver basket. Now silver is back up over $20 and some are predicting much higher prices on the horizon, just like they said over 10 years ago.

Y es, the American public sitting out the COVID-19 virus is now having to deal with what is referred as a “small change shortage.” caused apparently by hoarding. Coffee shops and other retail outlets that deal in cash have been hit hard by the shortage, finding themselves unable to make change. Apparently, people have decided spontaneously and in large numbers that nickels, dimes and quarters, as they have value as being made of metal, will somehow maintain their worth better than the pieces of paper being printed in Washington. The government has acted decisively to meet the threat by having the Federal Reserve convene a 22 strong U.S. Coin Task Force to “mitigate the effects of low coin inventories caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.” Ironically, of course, the Fed is the source of America’s long suffering backed-by-nothing currency.",JPM,en,Zero Hedge

Almost one third of Brits say their company’s finance teams will not be returning to the office with other employees in July and will now work at home most of the time. It also emerged that 70 per cent of City-based workers do not feel comfortable commuting to work via public transport anymore and think it will be one of the most stressful parts of their day.

It hasn’t been that long since Neil Woodford, one of the UK’s most famous stock pickers, fell from grace, when he had to close his fund due to poor performance. Based on my own anecdotal evidence, it’s quite clear that many investors and their financial advisers still believe in the benefits of stock picking. Who can blame them, surely it must be true that if you pay more to access the expertise of a seasoned investment manager then the outcome will be better? If it was only that simple. In the same way that it is often investor sentiment that drives stock market returns rather than the hard-cold facts in front of them, so it is with selecting funds. What you believe in appears to matter more than what might be backed up by the hard evidence.",JPM,en,ETF Express

BNP’s new Environmental Absolute Return Thematic (EARTH) Fund will trade energy, materials, agriculture and industrials stocks in both developed and emerging markets with market caps of more than USD1 billion. It will take long punts in innovative companies that are addressing an assortment of environmental challenges – such as carbon emissions, waste production, and food, water and energy concerns - and pair them with short bets on unsustainable firms, or those names whose business models are vulnerable to transition risk. Short positions are used both to hedge long positions as well as an alpha source in the portfolio, and which have a positive impact by increasing the cost of capital for companies failing to address environmental challenges. “Companies positioned to help address the significant environmental challenges we face will outperform those that either take no action or indeed contribute to these issues,” said Edward Lees, joint portfolio manager of the fund. “The latter will increasingly be at risk of having stranded assets and will be forced to take write-downs.” Stock selection is built around thematic, relative value, or catalyst-driven trade ideas generated from a proprietary database, with potential positions mapped and measured using eight sustainable development goals (SDGs).",JPM,en,Hedgeweek

Looking at the income statement first, JPM reported Q2 revenue of $33.8BN, up $4.3BN Y/Y, and smashing expectations of $30.3BN, largely as a result of a surge in trading and IBanking revenue, offset by a higher than expected credit loss provision. Indeed, despite the surge in revenue, net Interest income was actually down $0.6BN Y/Y to $14 billion as the bank's net interest margin continues to be depressed. Still, the bank reported EPS of $1.38, which while down $1.44 from the $2.88 a year ago, was also stronger than the $1.01 expected. Why the nearly $5 billion drop in Net Income? Because JPM continued to aggressively build loan loss reserves ahead of what is shaping up to be the worst financial crisis since Lehman (more below).",JPM,en,Zero Hedge

Kyle Sanders, an analyst at Edward Jones, told Bloomberg : “We’ve got a full three months of the pandemic coming through the numbers now. The first quarter was rough, but it really only reflected a couple of weeks in March.” Loan losses are expected to rise as spiking unemployment has left many unable to service, or pay back, their loans.

Better-informed and more critical customers, along with a push to combat the complex and opaque medical billing process, are creating demand for innovation in the healthcare payments space. Despite a titanic market size and room for innovation, digital transformation is occurring incrementally at best. In fact, 90% of healthcare providers still leverage paper and manual processes for collections, according to data from a report commissioned by InstaMed and compiled by Qualtrics. And even when healthcare providers offer digital solutions like online portals to customers (which 60% do ), they seem to be falling short: While the majority of consumers claim they want to make appointments (68%), fill out registration forms (68%), and pay healthcare bills (61%) online, the share of consumers who actually do so hovers around 30% for those use cases.",JPM,en,Business Insider

2020-06-06 08:16:00-05:00,$1M Bitcoin Will Force JPMorgan to Wyoming for Safety — Caitlin Long,"Major legal threats in the case of a big leap in Bitcoin price will see banks scrambling for support, the advocate forecasts. JPMorgan would have to move to Wyoming to protect itself from million-dollar Bitcoin ( BTC ), one of the United States’ most successful legislators has warned. Speaking on financial news show the Keiser Report on June 6, Caitlin Long argued that Wyoming was now far ahead of New York on Bitcoin support. Long: $1M BTC will spark lawsuits In the future, she told host Max Keiser , Bitcoin may cost $1 million, which will bring new forms of legal problems for owners and financial institutions. “There are people now finally starting to put leads on Bitcoin because Bitcoin is being lent out and that’s what lenders do — they put leads on collateral,” she said. “We’re skating to where the puck is going to be and thinking about where the attack vectors are going to come from. And one of them could be that if Bitcoin costs $1 million, guess what? Now all of a sudden plaintiffs’ attorneys start coming after everybody and saying, ‘Hey, you bought a Bitcoin that somebody had a lead against and now it’s mine,’ and they try to take it away from you.” Long is perhaps the best-known pro-Bitcoin voice in the U.S. regulatory arena.",JPM,en,Cointelegraph

Having just gone through a traumatically dangerous experience, and lived, a person might naturally become euphoric for it. Not uncommon in combat situations, your body marshals all its resources including many physiological responses and counteractions. When it’s all over, there’s evolution working overtime in your brain rewarding these survival instincts. And it can be a huge problem if left unchecked. Long-term mental health issues, yes, but more immediate, too. Whilst dosed up with pleasurable neurotransmitters like dopamine you might not notice just how badly you were yourself wounded in the process, unable to more precisely appreciate the gravity of your situation beyond the very short run. There’s a common sort of community response along similar lines, too. The expression lightning never strikes the same place twice is this idea that having experienced tragedy once nothing so bad should happen again.",JPM,en,Zero Hedge

This was ironic for several reasons, the first of which is that it was Powell's own justification for easing that enabled Trump to immediate escalate the trade war.

Fast forward to today when Goldman prompted howls of outrage among the bitcoin faithful when the bank released a multi-strategy report that took some pot shots at crypto, saying among other things, that ""we do not recommend Bitcoin on a strategic or tactical basis for clients’ investment portfolios even though its volatility might lend itself to momentum oriented traders."" The report also took the completely unoriginal track to compare Bitcoin’s rise, if not so much fall, to the Tulip mania of the 1600s in the Netherlands, although one look at the chart below suggest that such comparisons are woefully inaccurate with most bitcoin bulls laughing at repeated rumors of bitcoin's demise.",JPM,en,Zero Hedge

2020-05-21 07:41:00-05:00,Why Innovation Is Key to Accelerating Battery Storage Growth,"By any measure, 2019 was a breakout year for energy storage in the U.S. Fueled by improved economics, increased demand for resilience, and the ever-increasing integration of intermittent renewable generation, energy storage installations hit an all-time high of 522 megawatts/1,113 megawatt-hours last year. Though coronavirus-related supply chain disruptions, macroeconomic damage and uncertainty have lowered 2020 installation forecasts, analysts remain bullish on the longer-term prospects of storage. According to Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables, global installations will reach 15 gigawatts per year by 2024. The explosive growth of storage is reminiscent of solar and wind, both of which have become mainstream generation sources thanks dramatically improved economics, expanded manufacturing scale, policy support, and customer demand.

As we reported, ""HSBC had 15 ""back-testing exceptions"" in January and March, when the firm was caught out by moves in the prices of precious metals. Europe’s biggest bank said … problems were caused in part by “delivery disruptions in the gold market” which means that we now know which bank was on the other side of the gold spot-future trade."" Today we also learned just how much these unexpected moves cost Europe's largest bank: according to Bloomberg, HSBC lost around $200 million in one day in March because of the previously discussed disruptions to the gold market that caused prices to diverge dramatically in key trading hubs. The one-day loss, which far exceeded the maximum loss anticipated by HSBC’s value-at-risk models, was unusually large for a market in which the leading banks - HSBC and JPMorgan - typically make around $200 million in an entire year.",JPM,en,Zero Hedge

For the past two years, crypto-media outlets and Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocates have placed heavy emphasis on the need for institutional investors to embrace the cryptocurrency sector. The oft-stated belief was that institutional inflow would lead to mass adoption and an incredible spike in the value of crypto-assets as a whole. Fast forward to the present, and the total cryptocurrency market capitalization has yet to reach the $750 billion all-time high seen in late 2017. The slow recovery of crypto prices raises a few hard to answer questions. If institutional funds have been flowing into cryptocurrencies, why hasn’t there been a significant price increase over the last three years? Either there is an almost infinite sell pressure — which shouldn’t be a barrier considering the total crypto market cap is just $248 billion — or this theory that institutional investment will pump crypto prices does not hold.",JPM,en,Cointelegraph

Even though many insurers may deny claims or discourage business owners from even applying, ongoing litigation and legislative proposals could reward those that apply now with a payout later down the road. A series of class-action lawsuits is raising the question of what losses are covered during a pandemic.

Because some of the WFH and back-up offices across the river were having technical difficulties, the bank had asked all of its traders to return to its Manhattan headquarters, despite widespread worries abut the virus. Now, those traders will likely be celebrated by their colleagues once all of this over for refusing to be cowed by the corona.",JPM,en,Zero Hedge

Numbers out of major automakers on Wednesday this week confirmed a worst case scenario: that the global pandemic is doing severe (and potentially irreversible) damage to an industry that was in ugly shape even before the coronavirus outbreak began. GM saw sales plunge 7.1% and Fiat saw sales drop 10% for the first quarter of 2020 , both larger than expected declines, according to Bloomberg . It's also worth noting that the industry didn't quite grind to a halt until March, and so Q2 numbers could wind up being far worse. Toyota's sales fell 37% in March , with even its best-selling RAV4 dropping 25%. Nissan had the weakest quarterly results, posting a 30% drop in sales for the first three months of the year .

Sir Chris Hohn, founder of the USD28 billion activist-focused firm The Children’s Investment Fund (TCF), is one prominent advocate, having stepped up his campaign against companies failing to act on climate change. Earlier this month, Hohn – whose fund gained more than 40 per cent in 2019 - called on Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered to withdraw financing for new fossil fuel projects. “Investing in a company that doesn’t disclose its pollution is like investing in a company that doesn’t disclose its balance sheet,” Hohn wrote last year. “If governments won’t force disclosure, then investors can force it themselves.” The pace of change suggests ESG is no longer simply a “luxury” within the investment management industry, say some market participants.",JPM,en,Hedgeweek

Hedge fund manager Ken Griffin – who started trading at age 19, and now at 51 has amassed a fortune worth $15 billion – spoke about some of the near- and long-term risks in a recent interview. Griffin sees inflation as a danger in the longer term, mostly because the financial experts lack tools to determine when inflationary trends are starting. Griffin recounts how his firm’s best analysts were caught flat-footed in 2018 when the Fed started raising rates. Regarding the lack of accurate predictive foresight, Griffin says, “If there were inflation, the markets are utterly and completely unprepared for that.” But inflation, being invisible for now, is a long-term worry. Griffin sees the coronavirus outbreak has a larger threat, at least for the present. Griffin notes that a number of major companies – Apple is a particularly good example – have already announced lower Q4 and Q1 earnings, disrupted supply chains, and even store closings in response to the viral epidemic as it expands out of China.",JPM,en,Nasdaq

I suspect even to this day many commentators still do not realise what a huge story High Yield Bonds represent.

Managed accounts increasingly take centre stage… Submitted By Hugh Leask | 24/02/2020 - 5:14pm For all the attendant challenges facing hedge funds – from greater fee pressures and more onerous compliance burdens to lacklustre performance and investor aversion – the industry has time and again demonstrated its ability to continually innovate and reshape the way it does business. As the balance of power moves decisively away from managers and towards investors, managed accounts have continued to gain traction among allocators who want a greater degree of control, customisation and tailoring in their alternative investments, underpinned by the promise of increased transparency in portfolios and the appeal of lower fees. As interest in managed account investing has piqued – industry estimates suggest an annual double-digit growth in this area – the notion of the structure gradually becoming the investment model of choice in the future appears to be borne out by the numbers: more than a third (36 per cent) of investors polled in last year’s JP Morgan’s annual Institutional Investor Survey allocated to hedge funds through managed accounts in 2018, up from 29 per cent in 2016 – with that number tipped to grow further. “Year-over-year, there continues to be an increase in demand for managed accounts,” observes Joshua Kestler, head of the business at HedgeMark, the USD23 billion hedge fund dedicated managed account platform unit of BNY Mellon. “As hedge fund managed accounts become more mainstream, we see increasing demand from new allocators looking to adopt the structure, and from existing investors to grow their exposure to manage accounts.",JPM,en,Hedgeweek

There's a reason why President Trump touted 401k growth during his State of the Union address last week, because balances are increasing, and it will help him win the election. Fidelity noted that 401k millionaires soared last quarter, reaching a record level.

The number of IRA millionaires increased to 208,000, also a record high and an increase from 182,400 in Q3. All of these new 401k and IRA millionaires were created through President Trump's pressure on the Federal Reserve to unleash easy money policies to boost the stock market.

But what framework(s) should we use to understand the role that gold should play in investment processes and policies? In Part I of this series, I present one useful framework which implies that gold is significantly ‘under-owned’ and, consequently, undervalued at present. A Brief History of Gold’s Monetary Role Most investors are familiar with the ancient use of gold and silver as money, and that gold still provided the monetary base for economies well into the 20th century. Indeed, less than a century ago, in the aftermath of WWI and associated large currency devaluations and hyperinflations in Europe, there were several international conferences held to try and strengthen gold’s role as a source of monetary and economic stability. 75 years ago the famous Bretton-Woods conference was held, formally re-establishing gold’s role at the centre of the international monetary system.",JPM,en,Zero Hedge

And so, with algos once again looking at geopolitical risk as something more than merely a reason for the Fed to ease further, US equity futures slumped to red for 2020, with Boeing once again dragging down the Dow after a new, potentially ""catastrophic"" wiring issue was discovered on the 737 MAX … ... as European shares extended losses and were set for their worst day in a week, with the European Stoxx 600 index down 1.12%.",JPM,en,Zero Hedge

The crypto yuan, which may be on offer as soon as 2020, will be fully backed by the central bank of the world’s second-largest economy, drawing its value from the Chinese state’s ability to impose taxes in perpetuity. Other national authorities are bound to embrace this powerful idea. Little is known about the digital yuan except that it’s been in the works for five years and Beijing is nearly ready to roll. The consensus is that the token will be a private blockchain, a peer-to-peer network for sharing information and validating transactions, with the People’s Bank of China in control of who gets to participate.

We asked execs at companies innovating in the home-lending industry about what changes they see coming in the next decade. Experts expect the industry, which is still bogged down in byzantine, paper-heavy steps, to rapidly evolve in the coming years as the Amazon effect hits mortgage providers. In the not-too-distant future, tech advancements and continued partnerships between banks and fintechs could mean home-closings happen in days instead of dragging on for weeks. Visit BI Prime for more stories . Home ownership is intrinsic to the American dream. But at the start of this decade, the notion had taken on the spectre of nightmare — a white-picket fence charred and mangled by excess, neglect, and complacency. The mortgage industry took center stage in the global financial collapse in 2008 and 2009, revealing an antiquated, deeply flawed process that, instead of serving as a beacon of prosperity and wealth, rained financial destruction upon millions of Americans.",JPM,en,Business Insider
2019-12-20 12:27:43-05:00,Schechter: Life Insurance 'Gets A Bad Rap',"Imagine this situation. You invest $100,000 in a rental home with a friend to be used as a passive income generator. Ten years later, the principal mortgage is paid off and the investment is worth $150,000. Now, let’s say you were looking to free up some cash for another purchase. You’re considering selling, but want to be as tax efficient as possible. Your options are to: Sell your share of the house Never sell Refinance the investment, borrowing against the real estate as collateral Option A will get you cash quickly, but will leave you with a high capital gains tax bill upfront. Option B is tax efficient (as the house can be passed down to your estate tax-free) but it doesn’t solve your need for cash today. In this scenario, option C is the way to go. Because borrowing is not a taxable event, it allows you to get cash now without paying any taxes on your investment. This is a common strategy used by real estate investors, but what many people don’t realize is it’s also applicable to other alternative assets—particularly life insurance.",JPM,en,Benzinga Feeds

2019-12-17 23:05:00-05:00,Boeing 737 MAX Production Halt Will Slash A Third Off Q1 GDP,"Boeing 737 MAX Production Halt Will Slash A Third Off Q1 GDP Several months ago, when news of the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX fleet first hit, we wrote that this would likely lower GDP growth by around 0.3%-0.5% in both Q2 and Q3, as the collapse in shipments was only partially offset by a pickup in the inventory component. Last night’s announcement that production of the plane will also be halted indefinitely, suggests a longer, and more acute hit to US GDP. First, some history: After the plane was grounded in March, deliveries were halted, producing a roughly 33% decline in nondefense aircraft and parts shipments. However, Boeing continued to produce the plane—albeit in more limited quantities (42/month vs. 52/month)—and placed them in inventory instead of shipping them out while waiting for reauthorization. As a result, industry-wide production of aircraft declined by a much less dramatic ~20%. All that stopped last night. According to economists from JPMorgan, Goldman and Capital Economics, Boeing's work stoppage will cut up to 0.5% from first quarter 2020 GDP, with risk to the upside as Boeing’s suppliers are already reeling from the uncertainty around just how long this production halt will last.",JPM,en,Zero Hedge

Copeland said U.S.-based Spirit, which manufactures the 737 Max's fuselage, is one of the most exposed suppliers, deriving at least half of its sales from Boeing.

Wall Street analysts have been hesitant to venture beyond neutral ratings for the company. Of 10 that cover the stock, only one rates it ""overweight"" and two rate it ""underweight.""

Japan and China were at or near the top of foreign portfolio investment in the United States, including stocks and short- and long-term bonds, in 2017 with $2 trillion and $1.5 trillion respectively, a U.S. Treasury survey showed. Yet Asia has a poor record of protecting its assets stranded overseas when the cycle turns. In the 1990s, Japanese investors incurred significant losses, primarily on property. During the 2008 crisis, a range of Asian sovereign wealth funds and high net-worth individuals lost heavily on advanced economy shares, real estate, and mortgage-backed and structured securities.The desire to invest overseas partly reflects concern about political risk and governance at home.",JPM,en,The Economic Times India

For boomers wondering where to start when it comes to retirement saving and investing, there are plenty of options out there that can both limit risk and potentially generate big returns. Here are eight ways to invest for retirement. 1. Savings And Cash Accounts One of the most risk-free places to put retirement funds is in high-yield savings accounts, cash accounts or certificates of deposit. These options are FDIC insured for up to $250,000 per person per bank, but the typical yields are relatively low. Today, investors can expect to max out their annual cash returns in the 2% to 2.75% range, slightly higher than the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation target. 2.

Normand says investors are betting on strong economic growth that isn't likely to materialize, and their error has helped push stock indexes to all-time highs.

A decade later, their popularity is slipping.The number of ATMs around the world fell for the first time last year as banks closed branches and redirected resources toward digital payments, consulting firm RBR said in a study released on Monday. Declines in four of the world’s five largest markets - China, the U.S., Japan and Brazil - drove the 1% drop in ATMs in 2018. In the fifth, India, “growth slowed considerably,” London-based RBR said.Bank customers are increasingly turning to their mobile phones for routine financial services, and moving away from cash in favor of credit and debit cards. JPMorgan Chase & Co., the biggest U.S. bank, cut back its branches by 2% last year while earmarking $10.8 billion for technology. The lender saw a 5% increase in active digital customers, and an 11% gain in active mobile customers.While the ATM count worldwide has fallen for the first time, the shift away from the machines isn’t a new phenomenon.",JPM,en,The Economic Times India

I had become a capitalist, and it felt good.""Since taking control of Berkshire Hathaway in 1965, Buffett has marshalled the company to an annual average gain of 20.5 percent, more than double the average advance of the S&P 500.Berkshire's market value is now around $530 billion.The success comes not only from Buffett's investments in other publicly-traded companies but also from an assortment of holdings of profitable companies in a range of sectors, including insurance, freight rail transportation and electric utilities.But Buffett is an enterprising stock picker and his quarterly list of holdings is closely watched by other investors.""Most portfolio managers would be considered successful when they are right 70% of the time.",JPM,en,The Economic Times India

In this op-ed, Nakai argues that the common refrain that ""data is the new oil"" is inaccurate. While data has potential to drive revenue growth and cut costs, most companies don't have the expertise to get real value from it, he says. ""Data is the oil of the 21st century"" is commonly quoted in corporate America today. These eight words embody the excitement and promise that data has the power to redefine commerce as we know it. It's catchy, but inaccurate. It does a great disservice to oil. Data has the potential to drive revenues, cut costs and increase profits. But the vast majority of companies don't have infrastructure or expertise to derive value from it. Today, the reality is data is nowhere near oil.

But under the Companies Act, banks that are also registered companies can have chief executives who are over 70 years of age by passing a special resolution. IndusInd Bank and HDFC Bank have their current chiefs reaching the RBI age cap over the next year and half, said analysts.“We believe that an extension in age limit, if it happens, will only plug the regulatory gap between the corporate sector and banks,” said Motilal Oswal analyst Nitin Agarwal. “Recent management changes in Yes Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank show that the RBI exercises stricter vigilance on banks as compared to the corporate sector (regulator),” Agarwal said. The central bank will continue to retain its control over bank managements irrespective of its decision on the age limit, he added.In 2014, RBI raised the upper age limit for bank managing directors and CEOs to 70 years from 65, in line with the Companies Act, 2013.",JPM,en,The Economic Times India

Bessant said BofA's patents could allow the bank to plug into blockchain if the need arises going forward.

Deutsche Bank reported Q4 net revenue of €5.58BN that was 2.6% below the average analyst estimate of €5.73, led by another decline in trading revenue, resulting in a pretax loss of €319 million in line with estimates of a €331.0 million loss. And as the bank shrank for an eighth straight quarter in the final months of last year, CEO Christian Sewing pledged even more cost cuts although it is clear by now that cost cutting has starting to eat into profits. In the volatilte fourth quarter, in which market gyrations were supposed to help the company's trading desk (despite images of police raiding the bank’s headquarters in November) revenue shrank another 2.4%, led by a slump in the key fixed-income trading business that did even worse than peers.",JPM,en,Zero Hedge

Talks between the two lenders have been intensifying, as was implied by reports about meetings with senior German Ministry of Finance officials in recent weeks. DB's inability to reverse its slump in revenue has apparently led the German state to the conclusion that the only way to save both banks is a merger that will allow them to cut costs amid a search for synergies. And DB investors, while still supportive of CEO Christian Sewing, are growing uncomfortable with their mounting on-paper losses. Though a merger, as one analyst pointed out, would be no panacea.

However, the surprise was that contrary to the CBO's last forecast, the budget deficit is now expected to hit $1 trillion two years later than previously projected. Specifically, the U.S. budget deficit is forecast to widen to ""only"" $897 billion over the 12 months through September, from $779 billion last year. This means that contrary to the CBO's last forecast in April, the U.S. budget deficit will top $1 trillion in fiscal 2022. The CBO estimated in April that the budget deficit for the entire fiscal year would increase to $804 billion, before widening to $981 billion in fiscal 2019 and topping $1 trillion in 2020. “That reduction in projected deficits results primarily from legislative changes -- most notably a decrease in emergency spending,” the CBO said, somewhat optimistically especially since the economy is forecast to slow over the next three years with the growth rate easing to 2.3% in 2019, 1.7% next year, and 1.6% in 2021, the CBO forecasted; growth was an estimated 3.1% last year. “The slowdown begins in 2019 as the positive effects of recent tax legislation on business investment are expected to wane and federal purchases under current law are projected to drop sharply starting in the fourth quarter of this year,” according to the report.",JPM,en,Zero Hedge

Commenting on this phenomenon among others, two weeks ago JPMorgan quant Marko Kolanovic said, correctly, that "" liquidity has become to a large extent driven by market volatility"" reinforcing a negative feedback loop between volatility, liquidity and investors flows, and as the most recent examples he cited the unprecedented drop in futures market depth or "" record low liquidity "" we discussed previously (shown in the chart below), the currency flash crash on Jan 2, or the equity market “upside crash” on December 26.

As JPM's strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou noted then, extrapolating spec positions to capture the latest open interest changes - the red dots in the chart below - showed a reading that was not far from the previous capitulation levels of January/February 2016. Additionally, the short interest on the SPY - the biggest equity ETF used by institutional investors to express equity views - had jumped to the levels previously seen also during the capitulation episode of January/February 2016.
