The underlying issue is one that worries all central banks. Will banks still be strong enough to fund the recovery, particularly for small and midsized businesses, when government guaranteed loans expire? How policymakers answer this question has major implications for bank dividends, financial regulation and the shape of quantitative easing programmes. This makes the next salvo of measures from the European Central Bank all the more interesting. Last month, the Japanese central bank took the unprecedented step of paying Japan’s smaller regional banks an extra 0.1 per cent of interest “to enhance the resilience of the regional financial system”.",INFY,en,Zero Hedge

The TCS buyback quantum is a little lower than what the market was anticipating. The Rs 16,000-crore buyback with the pricing at Rs 3,000 is quite interesting. What is your view?The quantum is lower and will not move the lever in a big way. It will not even be 1.7% of equity. The market was wondering if this buyback was to try and raise money for Shapoorji Pallonji but that does not seem to be the case.It is actually just 1.5% of the equity count.

It is vital to ask, using such criteria, whether we are creating ‘sustainable finance’ today.The measures are clear. If you are financing a coal-based power station, that is not sustainable finance. That undermines natural capital, and damages human capital with its negative health impacts. Finance also should be sound from the point of view of risk and return – that soundness is shaped by what finance is financing.

Last week was quite a typical week for the markets because on one hand the week started with the Nifty IT doing extremely well and it ended with the pharma stocks doing exceptionally well. And these included the large cap stocks and not the midcap or the smallcap ones which often give price performance when a move of 10% plus happens on a TCS or Infosys earnings. And similar is the case in the pharma stocks as well, Lupin, Dr Reddy’s, Sun Pharma and many of these other stocks like Cipla were also moving up higher. But there has been a slight change to the market behaviour as intraday dips or intraday sharp corrections which come across on the Bank Nifty tend to trigger out a lot of stop losses for a lot of traders like what we saw on Friday.",INFY,en,Economic Times India

The brokerage prefers Infosys, Tech Mahindra and HCL Technologies, which are trading about 11-14% away from the new target prices.“HCL’s mid-quarter update suggests that revenue growth is likely to surprise on the upside for most of the IT companies,” said Morgan Stanley in a client note. “We believe the demand environment has held up well and that could support growth recovery — thus lifting multiples as investors gain more confidence.”The higher price targets, according to the brokerage, reflect better revenue growth rates, change of outlook and assumptions of reduced cost of equity.Technology stocks have been among the best performers since the stock market rebound from its March lows with the NSE’s IT (information technology) index gaining 77% as against the 51% advance in the Nifty.",INFY,en,Economic Times India

In order to invest in products, you need to have risk capital. Risk capital in India is still very expensive and government help is necessary, says Partner, Baring Private Equity. Where do you sense big opportunities within the IT universe?IT actually has a big broad sort of horizon at this moment and everything which feeds into it -- the enabling ecosystem of telecom, fibre etc are big beneficiaries. It is really about everyone who facilitates gathering large amounts of data whether it is the Internet of Things (IoT) which gathers data from objects or whether it is the industry, the cell phone industry, the variable industry which gathers data about people, the cloud which helps store data securely. Then comes the layer of artificial intelligence which actually exploits that data, gets insights and takes us forward. Covid is on everybody’s top of mind and there is a lot of data floating around. However brilliant people are, no one could actually figure out what it was all about, till a gentlemen called Dr Jacobson in Tennessee who runs the a Oak Ridge National Laboratory which has one of the fastest supercomputers in the world, took 17,000 samples and fed it into the computer putting it in a self learning algorithm and came out with the hypothesis that this is something like a Bradykinin storm which is completely different from what everybody felt it was.",INFY,en,Economic Times India

Coming to Aurobindo Pharma, after the company announced the last quarterly numbers, we have seen a bit of a correction there and now the stock has started showing some upward momentum given the kind of product portfolio that Aurobindo has which is a combination of the API business as well as business on the US side though with a lower margin.

If HCL Tech is giving good guidance or is seeing 1%-2% extra growth than what they had earlier seen, why are other midcap IT names going up?We have to keep in mind that HCL Tech had earlier given a guidance, one of the few companies which had given the guidance at the end of Q1. It was not expected that immediately in the second quarter, there would be an improvement in the business momentum versus what they had guided for. So to that extent, I believe there is a positive surprise both on the revenue growth point of view because we had factored 2.3% QoQ growth for the second quarter as well as EBIT margin upwards of 20.5%. That is also higher than what we had factored in. So there is a dual upbeat versus expectation and my read through will be this means their outlook regarding the peaking for the second half remains and with a second quarter seeing a better than expected performance, the full year outlook should also improve.",INFY,en,Economic Times India

Currently only certain types of securities such as depository receipts are able to be listed in foreign markets, and only after the companies go public in India.The new policy, aimed at helping local firms achieve better valuations, could be a shot in the arm for Indian unicorn start-ups valued at over $1 billion and Reliance’s digital unit which is eyeing a U.S. listing after raising over $20 billion from global names like KKR & Co.But in recent weeks Indian officials told global investors and companies in meetings they were considering mandating a secondary listing for local companies on Indian bourses after they list abroad, five sources said.The time period under consideration for such a requirement ranges from 6 months to 3 years, sources said.A separate senior regulatory source in India said “dual listing was being considered by the (finance) ministry for sure,” but a final position on the matter has not been reached.Japan’s SoftBank and an Indian payment firm it backs, Paytm, as well as Reliance and U.S.-based Sequoia Capital have conveyed to the government the secondary listing provision risks splitting trading volumes, hurting long-term valuations and raising compliance needs and costs, the sources added.“To require companies to subsequently list in India will make these rules meaningless,” said a senior executive working at a global venture-capital firm.SoftBank and Sequoia have invested in various Indian firms like ride-hailing company Ola and hospitality firm Oyo.",INFY,en,Economic Times India

Worldwide AI market revenue revenues are likely to surpass $300 billion in 2024 with a five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.1 per cent. Software is the largest AI technology group delivering roughly 80 per cent of all AI revenue. Most of the software revenue comes from AI applications -- $120.4 billion in 2020 -- with AI Software Platforms delivering the remainder. ""AI applications continue to be at the forefront of digital transformation (DX) initiatives, driving both innovation and improvement to business operations,"" Ritu Jyoti, programme Vice President, Artificial Intelligence Research at IDC, said in a statement.","INFY,INTU",en,Sify.com

How do you think this market will manage to climb the wall of worry?As long as the worries persist I guess. The way I think about this market is that the broader Indian market was in a bear phase since 2018. It has been quite a long bear market considering that in the past two decades, the longest one we had was about 15 months during the global financial crisis (GFC). So for nearly two years, midcaps have been in a bear market. We are beginning to recover. Post the corporate tax cut, the markets had started to recover, when the Covid happened and again it went for a capitulation move. March actually marks the bottom of the market in terms of valuations, sentiment and probably even in terms of economic growth and corporate profitability. If that is the case, then we are just three months into the recovery in terms of markets, not talking economic terms and if that is the case, then we could not be so worried about the next maybe 5-10% correction lurking at some point of time.",INFY,en,Economic Times India

This could even be raw data but stripped of any personal identifiers.Thus, invoices from a toy distributor in Pune could be available to a competitor in Satara, with buyer details removed. Data about consumer demand for Patanjali’s Neem soap in Varanasi and Prayagraj could be available to Dabur. While factual data will be given for free, value added data like estimates of regional demand for the next year, for any company, could mandatorily be available at a “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” price.The message from the committee to entrepreneurs and businesspersons in India is: the Indian state or a data trustee (which could be a government department) has the rights over the data your company collects or creates.",INFY,en,Economic Times India

In separate interviews, Policybazaar co-founder Yashish Dahiya — whose company is backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd. — and MobiKwik frontman Bipin Preet Singh urged Modi to go further. Emboldened by growing hostility against its giant neighbor, they want regulators to curb their access to Indian markets, establish rules to wrest back control of user data and bankroll local startups.“China has long been the bratty kid who thinks it’s OK to grab others’ cake without sharing your own,” Dahiya told Bloomberg News last week. India must strategically reduce market access before its neighbor becomes even more powerful. “If India doesn’t do it now, it can never be done,” said Dahiya, whose online insurance service targets a 2021 IPO at a $3.5 billion value.Dahiya and Singh are breaking with tradition in an Indian startup sector that over the past half-decade has attracted billions from Chinese companies and investment houses from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Hillhouse Capital.",INFY,en,Economic Times India

It is still doing quite well,” Gopinathan said. “Its relevance will increase significantly as we go into a distributed operating model.”Ignio is part of TCS-owned Digitate and helps companies reduce outages by identifying potential hotspots for failure in their networks.“The ability to look forward and predict where the hotspot is, the ability to look backwards and say where the core problem is, is one of the critical features of Ignio,” Gopinathan added. “Now, take that into a distributed operating model of an enterprise, because when you're using that for a server, you could as well use it for any distributed asset or any distributed resource that the enterprise has.”Ignio was expanded from Ignio AIOps to include four other products in the last year.It was a central product in the software exporter’s large deals in the previous fiscal year, said chief operating officer NG Subramaniam.“At the core is Ignio, our cognitive automation software, which can autonomously pre-empt or resolve system failures…The benefits were especially visible in the retail vertical during the holiday season peak and again during the panic shopping in March,” he said.Analysts said the market for such ‘self-healing’ software products will become bigger due to new work arrangements caused by the Covid-19 virus outbreak.IBM introduced its Watson AIOps last month, while Infosys' NIA and Wipro’s Holmes compete for market share.",INFY,en,Economic Times India

Since neither is likely to relent, it would be in the Supreme Court’s hands to nudge both in that direction, because a mutual agreement is a more lasting resolution than a judicial verdict.After the most recent appellate court ruling to reinstate Mistry, both parties have already met their original objectives. Tata Sons, briefly led by Ratan Tata during turbulent times after Mistry’s dismissal, needed him out as a result of failed trust. That has since been achieved.Mistry left the group’s leadership over three years ago, and stated in several representations that he did not want to return. Mistry’s fight has been to restore his pride after the ignominious firing in October 2016.The order, which will now be appealed at the Supreme Court, cleared Mistry as being fired wrongfully in no uncertain terms. So, he stands vindicated.What no court can do is sit in judgment of the business implications of any decisions taken by incumbent leaders.",INFY,en,The Economic Times India

Infosys, on the other hand, on Friday posted strong growth in banking and financial services and raised the bottom-end of its revenue target for fiscal 2020 — its new forecast is for 9-10% growth, compared with 8.5-10% earlier.“If you peel off the inorganic contribution from Stater for Infosys, the June 2019 year-on-year organic constant currency growth of Infosys was approximately 9.3% (vs TCS at 9.2%, on a much bigger base) and the September 2019 year-onyear organic constant currency growth of Infosys was below 6.0% (vs nearly 8% for TCS),” said Peter Bendor-Samuel, CEO of IT advisory Everest Research.“So, barring one acquisition, which is more of a one-off, Infosys’ financial services has actually underperformed that of TCS (and that too on a smaller base),” Bendor-Samuel added.",INFY,en,The Economic Times India

2019-10-11 22:14:32-05:00,Infosys vs TCS: How they stack up now,"ET Intelligence Group: The September 2019 quarter performance of Infosys affirms that the country’s second-largest software company appears to be on course to report a double-digit growth in dollar-denominated revenue for the current fiscal. This would be after a gap of six years — the last time it had reported a double-digit growth was back in FY14 when its revenue had grown by 11.5%. Infosys will also likely report higher top line growth than Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the biggest peer.In the first half of FY20, Infosys increased its revenue by 10.2% to $6,341 million. That puts the company into a comfortable position to clock above 10% growth for the full fiscal. This also makes the company’s revised revenue FY20 guidance of 9-10% growth sound too conservative. A sequential growth of around 2.3% in each of the remaining two quarters would help the company march past the upper end of its guidance. This looks achievable given the 2.3% and 2.5% sequential growth in the June and the September quarters, respectively, and the sustained momentum in order flow from clients. 71549815 At a time when TCS is undergoing a deceleration in growth momentum, Infosys appears to be back on the growth track.",INFY,en,The Economic Times India

There is the quality of management which will end up making a difference when you are deciding on your portfolio. An overhang of policies and decisions will always lie on SBI and that is why the market rightly keeps on rewarding the better players on the private side than on the PSU side.

Website, mobile apps, IVR — all have to get merged into one. While you are doing this, cyber security becomes an important matter to look into,” said Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief executive, Greyhound Research.During the integration, the lenders will generate huge amounts of data and analytics will play a bigger role to create 360-degree user profiles, taking data from multiple banks, Gogia said.A senior executive at a multinational tech services firm said even if the core banking platforms are the same, each would require customisation.Beyond technology integration, banks will need a better communication strategy.“Though amalgamation of banks and integration of technology is not new, the risk lies with the ‘unknown unknowns’. For example, there were differences in technology integration in the risk profile, asset portfolio for banks in the Middle East and the US,” said Sid Pai, a tech services consultant who has closely witnessed such amalgamations globally.Tech companies have deployed a large number of people during such mergers and it has resulted in long-term contracts for these companies, Pai said. “The backend integration is so huge.",INFY,en,The Economic Times India

Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.Shareholders are getting a little bit disconnected with the overall market right now, given that volatility has been at a low, there is no decisive direction and every time we are talking to experts, the indication is that the undertone of the market continues to remain rather negative. What does one do at a time like this?Given the slowdown that we are witnessing in the domestic economy and the quarterly earnings season, it is not likely to throw up many surprises. In that kind of a backdrop, it would be hard to imagine that we are going to have some strength in the market.

That’s about two thirds of the Rs 54,600 crore of such transactions for all of 2018, which was the most in at least six years, the data show.“In the last three years, buybacks had supported the rally in stocks and helped improve the earnings per share for companies,” said Umesh Mehta, head of research at Samco Securities in Mumbai. “That opportunity is now closed. Companies would now have to move back to distributing dividends, where the tax liability is lower.”70137558 The proposed tax may affect share purchases worth Re 10,000 crore that are in progress. Infosys, India’s second-largest provider of IT services, has until September 19 to complete buying back Rs 8,260 crore of its own stock, while Adani SEZ & Ports is looking to repurchase shares worth Rs 1,960 crore, according to exchange filings.Shares of Infosys extended two weeks of losses on Monday, while those of Adani SEZ closed at the lowest price since May 22.Companies have been using buybacks as a more tax-efficient way to return excess cash to shareholders in addition to dividends, which attract a levy of 15 per cent.",INFY,en,The Economic Times India

Under the new plan, Pravin Rao also gets shares worth Rs 4 crore.In total, Infosys revived its Esop for all staff, offering as many as five crore shares or 1.15% of its total stock. In 2016, the firm had committed 1% of shares in an Esop as it battled attrition of employees.The dissenting investors may have had concerns that the short-term incentive plan could affect the company in the long term, analysts said.“In the past, shareholders had approved the vesting period of three years, which has now been changed to an accelerated vesting of one year.",INFY,en,The Economic Times India

From Sunday, India imposed higher tariffs on some US goods, days after Washington withdrew a key trade privilege for New Delhi.Two senior Indian government officials said on Wednesday they were briefed last week on a US government plan to cap H-1B visas issued each year to Indians at between 10% and 15% of the annual quota.There is no current country-specific limit on the 85,000 H-1B work visas granted each year and an estimated 70% go to Indians.Both officials said they were told the plan was linked to the global push for ""data localisation"", in which a country places restrictions on data as a way to gain better control over it and potentially curb the power of international companies.",INFY,en,The Economic Times India

2019-04-28 00:49:47-05:00,The odd place out in a rotten school system,"One of India’s biggest failures is education. Before Independence, India’s best brains came from government schools. Today they are so rotten that poor parents switch their children from free government schools into expensive but better private schools.In a PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) competition in 2012, India came second last among 73 countries despite being represented by its two best states, Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh. The official reaction was to stop participating in PISA and criticise PISA’s methodology. By contrast, Vietnam saw PISA as a way of discovering its educational weaknesses and correcting them, and has risen today close to the top of PISA. Fortunately, India has finally seen the light and plans to restart competing in PISA in 2021.Rote learning is the rule in most Indian schools. The aim is to learn answers by heart and not question teachers, experiment with new ideas or argue. The government emphasis is on inputs like classrooms, toilets and midday meals, not learning outcomes.T S Eliot once asked, “Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge?",INFY,en,The Economic Times India

TCS’ net sales climbed 18.5 per cent to Rs 38,010 crore from Rs 32,075 crore in the year-ago quarter. Sharekhan said TCS’ earnings performance for Q4 looked relatively better as Infosys disappointed on the margins front. “We have tweaked our earnings estimates for FY2020 and FY2021 for Infosys, factoring in lower-than-expected margin guidance for FY2020 and a change in USD/INR rate. With robust total contract value (TCV) signings and improving business visibility, we believe Infosys would gradually catch up on revenue growth with TCS in FY2020 and in turn would narrow the valuation gap with TCS going forward,” the brokerage said.The brokerage firm, however, maintained ‘buy’ call on Infosys and TCS with a price target (PT) of Rs 840 and Rs 2,400, respectively.Both companies announced their financial result on the same day for the first time ever.",INFY,en,The Economic Times India

Someone who works in a garden, tending to plants and nursing saplings. There is an inherent ring of care and compassion to the term. Co-founder and former chief operating officer (COO)-turned ‘gardener’ at Mindtree, Subroto Bagchi’s recent tweets attacking Larsen & Toubro (L&T) as a bunch of marauders arriving at the gates of Mindtree’s Eden with “bulldozers and saw chains” to mow it all down “so that in its place, they can build a shopping mall” is rather imperious, contemptuous and derisive.As L&T’s leadership retorted, “We have bulldozers, we have cranes, we make things that make the nation proud. We make submarines, rockets, missiles and guns. We are a national company.” Any self-respecting professional would tend to agree with that last statement.So, what’s the din all about in the first place?

But it’s a tag he wears with pride. “I think I’m one even today. At least [in having] an entrepreneurial mindset,” he said at the TiECon event in Mumbai recently. When asked for his message to budding entrepreneurs, he contrasted the problems his generation of entrepreneurs faced with the ones faced by today’s lot. “Entrepreneurs today are much luckier than we were. There is intense competition here in India as well as outside. And competition is what will make you stronger and fitter,” Murthy said. The problems that his generation faced were primarily related to removing the various hurdles that the government had put in their path to success, he said. 68499436 Mission permission He shared a story of his friend, KV Ramani (CMD, Digital Holdings). “He [Ramani] applied for three-day foreign exchange, where he specified that he would spend two days in Paris and one day in Frankfurt.",INFY,en,The Economic Times India
