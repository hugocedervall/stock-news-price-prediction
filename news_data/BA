While telehealth has been on the brink of taking off for years, consumer usage of the tech ticked up slowly before 2020. The coronavirus pandemic has given consumers the push they need to adopt telemedicine on a wide scale — and we expect adoption to keep climbing so long as the pandemic rages on.

Furthermore, Mnuchin said he is merely carrying out the law prescribed by the Cares Act, and his actions were not an indication of disagreement between the top two U.S. economic policymakers.

Boeing's plane had been grounded around the world since March 2019, after the second of two 737 aircrafts crashed, with a combined death toll of 346. Boeing was left facing lawsuits from families, shareholders, and airlines — plunging it into the biggest crisis in its history and leaving planes sitting idle around the world. The US Federal Aviation Administration announced on Wednesday — 20 months after the plane was grounded — that the 737 Max is allowed to fly again following upgrades and fixes, after a far longer process than Boeing expected. The plane's return is good news for the company, but reopens wounds for those who lost loved ones in the crashes.

Their Demo-2 mission represented the first manned launch from US shores in nearly a decade and the first time a private firm, rather than a government space agency, sent people into orbit. For SpaceX, a private commercial space flight company started by Elon Musk, the trip was the last major demonstration needed before NASA certified its spacecraft system for regular crew flights, also paving the way for possible tourist flights.

Ellen Stofan, who currently leads the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum, will lead the team. Stofan served as NASA's chief scientist from 2013 to 2016. Other members include Jedidah Isler , an astrophysicist at Dartmouth College who studies supermassive black holes; Bhavya Lal, a space-policy strategist who works with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy; and Waleed Abdalati, another former NASA chief scientist (he served from 2011 to 2012) who's now at the University of Colorado.

Speaking to Institutional Asset Manager, Neuberger Berman’s head of ESG investing, Jonathan Bailey, says that there is currently an “insufficient level of transparency” around asset managers’ votes on company proposals. “Proxy votes do have value,” says Bailey, adding that steps like pre-announcing votes allows the industry to show it is “moving in a better direction”.",BA,en,InstitutionAlassetManager

Este descubrimiento indica que el agua se puede distribuir por la superficie lunar, y no se limita a lugares fríos y sombreados. SOFIA ha detectado moléculas de agua (H2O) en el cráter Clavius, uno de los cráteres más grandes visibles desde la Tierra, ubicado en el hemisferio sur de la Luna. Las observaciones anteriores de la superficie de la Luna detectaron alguna forma de hidrógeno, pero no pudieron distinguir entre el agua y su pariente químico cercano, el hidroxilo (OH). Los datos de esta ubicación revelan agua en concentraciones de 100 a 412 partes por millón, aproximadamente equivalente a una botella de agua de un tercio de litro, atrapada en un metro cúbico de suelo esparcido por la superficie lunar. Los resultados se publican en el último número de Nature Astronomy. “Teníamos indicios de que H2O, el agua familiar que conocemos, podría estar presente en el lado iluminado por el sol de la Luna”, dijo Paul Hertz, director de la División de Astrofísica en la Dirección de Misiones Científicas en la Sede de la NASA en Washington. “Ahora sabemos que está ahí.",BA,es,Gaceta de Salamanca

The coronavirus pandemic has been a watershed moment for telehealth — or the use of mobile technology to deliver health-related services, such as remote doctor consultations and patient monitoring — as patients have had to reimagine the ways they seek healthcare. While telehealth has been on the brink of taking off for years, consumer usage of the tech ticked up slowly before 2020. The coronavirus pandemic has given consumers the push they need to adopt telemedicine on a wide scale — and we expect adoption to keep climbing so long as the pandemic rages on. Once outbreaks became severe in the US, consumers began flocking to telehealth: Telehealth usage among US adults climbed 6 percentage points month-over-month from February 2020 — when 11% of respondents reported having tried telehealth — to March — when 17% said the same, per a survey by CivicScience.",BA,en,Business Insider

These initiatives will continue till normal operations resume,” said an Air India official, who did not wish to be identified.Officials said Air India managed to reduce its salary bill drastically through up to 15% pay cuts of employees, reduction in flying allowance to pilots and removal of people on contract after retirement.“Pilots’ salaries were fixed at 70 hours of flying earlier, which has now been reduced to 20 hours. Since there are limited international flights, the airline does not have to pay layover allowance to cockpit and cabin crew. On top of it, the airline has let go of about 250 people, who were retired but were serving on contract,” said the official.When contacted, Air India confirmed the move and said it has been able to “save a good amount on its wage bill from Rs 229.75 crore in April to Rs 120 crore in September”.Besides these initiatives, Air India provided an option to employees to go on leave without pay but that did not find many takers.As the government plans to sell Air India, the carrier has been trying to reduce its costs.",BA,en,Economic Times India

2020-10-14 18:42:23-05:00,A Russian rocket just carried a NASA astronaut to the ISS… but why?,"NASA astronaut Kate Rubins took a seat aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft headed for the International Space Station. The trip is the last of the seats that NASA will have to lease from Russia now that its own commercial crew program has matured. NASA's next U.S. launch is scheduled for early-to-mid November. NASA's Commercial Crew program finally produced real, tangible results when SpaceX's Crew Dragon carried a pair of astronauts to the International Space Station earlier this year. It was a very big deal for NASA, and the first time the space agency had launched a crewed mission from U.S. soil in almost a decade. NASA wants to be able to launch crewed missions whenever it wants, and it simply couldn't do that by leasing seats aboard Russian Soyuz rockets. So, the fact that NASA astronaut Kate Rubins just rode a Russian spacecraft to the orbiting laboratory certainly seems odd, but it's actually been planned for quite some time. NASA had hoped to have its commercial crew partners and their spacecraft ready for use much earlier than 2020, and when it became clear that both SpaceX and Boeing were running behind schedule they scrambled to secure seats aboard Russian space vehicles to ensure a continued U.S. presence on the space station.",BA,en,BGR

After initially promising a tit-for-tat rebuttal within the day , the company, presumably on the advice of well-heeled counsel, released a full response on Monday to Hindenburg Research's allegations of lies, deception, and outright fraud. For the most part, the company's response flatly denied most of the accusations against it — but many require a little nuance. Perhaps most notably, the company would like you to know that its truck did, in fact, simply roll down a hill for a video shoot. However, the video was not a lie, Nikola said, because it was shot by a third party and never insinuated the truck was actually moving on its own power.

In another recent case, mechanics found insect larvae in instruments that help determine an aircraft's airspeed even though the probe's covers had been used and the system flushed according to the manufacturer's guidance. The CAA also alerted operators that inappropriate dosage of the fuel biocide Kathon could lead to engines idling too slowly and to be on the lookout for unexpected corrosion of certain safety systems, such as the engine bleed air valve on the Boeing Co.

That doesn’t bode well for economic growth. For instance, companies have significantly cut travel. One executive told CNBC they are looking to reduce travel expenses permanently. “We just don’t need to necessarily make the trips that we’ve historically made.” This reduction in travel will further cripple airlines and hotels already reeling from the travel restrictions imposed during the pandemic.",BA,en,Zero Hedge

The Max was grounded in March 2019 after a pair of fatal crashes — in Indonesia and Ethiopia — that killed 346 people.Even as the company began testing the planes for recertification, a federal inspector general’s report said that Boeing had kept information from federal regulators about the flawed computer system that brought down the two jets during the plane’s initial approval process.The Max is the most recent model of Boeing’s 737, a type of aircraft with many variants over the decades. More than 10,000 737s have been built. The Max was released in 2017 in four lengths to accommodate up to 230 seats. The Max has larger, more fuel-efficient engines than the older models.If the Federal Aviation Administration is convinced that Boeing has corrected the problems that led to the crashes, the planes will return to service, but no timeline has been announced.The agency said in a statement that it “will lift the grounding order only after we are satisfied that the aircraft meets certification standards.”Boeing’s chief executive, David Calhoun, flew on the plane in February.",BA,en,Economic Times India

2020-06-29 15:48:00-05:00,The Boeing 737 Max just made a huge step towards getting back in the skies. Here's the complete history of the plane that's been grounded since 2 crashes killed 346 people 5 months apart. (BA),"When the 737 Max was announced in 2011 and entered service in 2017, the plane was touted as the next generation of a tried-and-tested workhorse of consumer aviation. The Max, a 737 with new more fuel-efficient engines and updated avionics and cabins, would have longer range, have a lower operating cost, and have enough in common with previous models so that pilots could switch back and forth between the two with ease. However, two fatal crashes involving the plane within five months of each other, which killed a combined 346 people, have led to questions about the plane's design and features. The crashes have also called attention to training standards, regulatory oversight, and pilot experience. Since the second crash in March, 2019, the plane has been grounded around the world as Boeing works to fix what appears to be a fundamental design flaw. On Monday, June 29, 2020, the plane made its first recertification flight, one of the final steps remaining before it can return to service. ",BA,en,Business Insider

Airlines are slashing orders for Airbus and Boeing passenger planes as the travel and tourism industry has collapsed. In response, carriers have had to quickly reduce operating capacity by ground fleets of planes until passenger volumes recover. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun recently warned it could take 2-3 years for air travel growth to return to pre-corona levels, adding that long term growth trends could take much longer. With reduced flights and declining orders for new planes, demand for cobalt used in jet turbine blades is expected to slump in the back half of the year. ""The harsh high temperature and pressure environments of the jet engine necessitates regular replacement of turbine blades,"" CRU analyst George Heppel told Reuters . ""But planes are grounded, turbine blades aren't being used and don't need replacing.""

Study predicts commercial hydrogen planes could be in the skies within 10 years,"With supportive investment and policy signals H2-powered flight could emerge as a major player for short-medium journeys within 10-15 years, study estimates Hydrogen-powered planes have ""significant, and so far underestimated"" potential to become a major force in the future of flight, and to thereby help reduce the aviation sector's growing impact on the climate, according to the findings of a major industry and EU-backed study released yesterday. The release of the study came on the same day as UK hydrogen aircraft start-up ZeroAvia successfully conducted the first ever electric-powered flight yesterday of a commercial-scale aircraft carried out in the UK. It argued that with supportive investment, regulation, and R&D signals, planes running on forms of zero carbon hydrogen power could be carrying passengers on regional commercial routes within the next 10 to 15 years, at ticket prices only a fraction higher than for today's fossil fuelled planes. Planes fuelled by direct hydrogen combustion have the potential to reduce in-flight greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 75 per cent compared to conventional planes, the study estimates, while hydrogen fuel cell technology - which uses H2 to produce electricity - could reduce emissions by as much as 75 to 90 per cent.",BA,en,BusinessGreen

Thanks to a new Space Act Agreement with NASA , Virgin Galactic is tasked with putting together a “new private orbital astronaut readiness program,” for the agency. That means finding companies or organizations with an interest in sending people to the space station — for whatever reason — and then finding the right transportation to get them up there. Virgin Galactic will also be responsible for coordinating the necessary resources, both in space and on the ground, to make these trips successful. It’s a similar mission to that of Space Adventures, a space tourism company that has put together trips to space for wealthy tourists. However, Virgin Galactic says it’s looking for a wide variety of customers, beyond the ones who just want a fun trip to space. “This is not just for potentially private space travelers, but could also be for researchers or even government researchers,” George Whitesides, Virgin Galactic’s CEO, tells The Verge, noting that people from all over the world could fly through this program. “THIS IS NOT JUST FOR POTENTIALLY PRIVATE SPACE TRAVELERS, BUT COULD ALSO BE FOR RESEARCHERS OR EVEN GOVERNMENT RESEARCHERS.” This new focus on orbital spaceflight may seem odd for Virgin Galactic, which has been mostly focused on sub orbital spaceflight for the last decade and a half.",BA,en,Novinite

During the 51 session plunge, Robin Hood users piled into the stock in the sub 20 range, with the number of users holding shares increasing from 4,450 users (in mid-January) to 469,200 (June 3), a 105x increase.

The coronavirus pandemic has been a watershed moment for telehealth — or the use of mobile technology to deliver health-related services, such as remote doctor consultations and patient monitoring — as patients have had to reimagine the ways they seek healthcare. While telehealth has been on the brink of taking off for years, consumer usage of the tech ticked up slowly before 2020. The coronavirus pandemic has given consumers the push they need to adopt telemedicine on a wide scale — and we expect adoption to keep climbing so long as the pandemic rages on. Once outbreaks became severe in the US, consumers began flocking to telehealth: Telehealth usage among US adults climbed 6 percentage points month-over-month from February 2020 — when 11% of respondents reported having tried telehealth — to March — when 17% said the same, per a survey by CivicScience.",BA,en,Business Insider

Behind the scenes, however, the Treasury’s responsibilities have fallen largely to the 42-year-old deputy secretary, Justin Muzinich. A major beneficiary of that bailout so far: Muzinich & Co., the asset manager founded by his father where Justin served as president before joining the administration. He reported owning a stake worth at least $60 million when he entered government in 2017. Today, Muzinich retains financial ties to the firm through an opaque transaction in which he transferred his shares in the privately held company to his father. Ethics experts say the arrangement is troubling because his father received the shares for no money up front, and it appears possible that Muzinich can simply get his stake back after leaving government.",BA,en,Zero Hedge

2020-05-27 12:16:00-05:00,Why SpaceX's launch for NASA is such a big deal for Elon Musk's rocket company and the US as a whole,"SpaceX is set to launch NASA astronauts to the International Space Station for the first time on Wednesday afternoon. It will be the first time an American-made spacecraft has launched humans from US soil in nearly a decade. If successful, the mission would resurrect the US's human spaceflight capabilities and open a new era of commercial space exploration. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . The last time the United States launched humans into space from American soil was in 2011, when the last Space Shuttle made its final voyage into orbit. Since then, NASA has relied on Russian Soyuz rockets to ferry its astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS). That has become increasingly expensive and limited US access to the station. That could all change at 4:33 p.m. ET on Wednesday. If weather, hardware, and other factors cooperate, SpaceX's Crew Dragon spaceship , built with NASA funds, will launch astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley towards the ISS in a mission called Demo-2.",BA,en,Business Insider

And with the US now commencing a lockout of Chinese telecom giant Huawei , with Beijing vowing to retaliate against Boeing, Qualcomm and Apple, tomorrow isn't looking good either, nor the next day, or the day after. In fact, it is safe to say that the increasingly belligerent rhetoric - and deeds - between the US and China will continue to escalate until the Nov 3 election, and potentially beyond it. There is a very simple reason for that: in a nation that seems impossibly divided on most issues and is ideologically polarized more than ever in history, China is the one thing that more than two-thirds of Americans can agree on, and they agree that they simply do not like China. Commenting on the chart above, Goldman says that the bank sees risk of ""further bilateral disputes ahead, especially as the coronavirus pandemic and low energy prices may make it more difficult for China to meet the trade deal’s $200bn purchase agreement."" At the same time, Goldman also believes the upcoming US presidential election, ""coupled with deteriorating sentiment towards China among Americans, will make it harder for US policymakers to strike a conciliatory tone on China.""

As part of CEO Dave Calhoun's PR tour, he participated in an interview with NBC that will be aired tonight.

""The recovery is going to be slow, with air traffic languishing at depressed levels for months,"" Calhoun predicted, according to Bloomberg . When asked if a major airline would fold, he replied ""Yes, most likely."" He continued: “Something will happen when September comes around. Traffic levels will not be back to 100%. They won’t even be back to 25%. Maybe by the end of the year we approach 50%.

Many a US think-tank is now little more than an extension of some US government agency, conducting research to validate previously arrived-at conclusions in furtherance of a specific institutional agenda. Likewise many corporations have gone beyond being mere defense or intelligence contractors. Rather, their business activities are from the outset designed to be readily weaponizable, meshing seamlessly with the armed services and intelligence agencies . It is not entirely clear how the process works, for there does not appear to be a system of contract awards for specific deliverables. Rather, it seems these capabilities are developed on the initiative of specific businesses which speculate their efforts will be utilized by the US national security establishment ever on the lookout for technological “game-changers”.",BA,en,Zero Hedge

We all know what happened there; once consumers got pinched in the GFC, rent payments couldn't be made, and it rippled down the chain and resulted in landlords foreclosing on properties.

We have described the financial troubles that were ahead for Superhosts in late March after noticing nationwide lockdowns led to a crash not just in the tourism and hospitality industries, but also a plunge in Airbnb bookings. It was to our surprise that Airbnb's management understood many of their Superhosts were overleveraged and insolvent, which forced the company to quickly erect a bailout fund for Superhosts that would cover part of their mortgage payments in April.",BA,en,Zero Hedge

When the aviation giant finally embraced it, an automated system in the 737 Max kicked off the biggest crisis in its history.","The two Boeing 737 Max plane crashes that killed 346 people have been attributed to a faulty automated system that pilots say they were not aware of.

There is a cruel irony in Boeing's crisis, as the company has a reputation for being traditionally less in favor of automated systems than Airbus, its biggest rival. And even though Boeing has used automation for a long time, pilots and experts say the company's philosophy was always to keep pilots informed and give them ultimate control.

The practice quickly evolved as aircraft technology increasing, reducing the number of stops in order to traverse the ocean.

Then relaxed regulations for twin-engine aircraft later saw smaller aircraft begin flying transpacific routes. The skies above the Pacific are now diverse with a wide variety of aircraft flying countless flights on a daily basis. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . Flying over oceans has been a common practice in aviation since before World War II. With the aerial mode of transportation offering quicker journey times than ocean liners, airlines quickly began to standardize the practice and offer reliable, scheduled services that would be a large step in making the world a smaller place. Transatlantic flying was the primary focus as Western Europe and the eastern United States were closer in terms of both distance and historical ties but flying over the Pacific Ocean soon became an area of interest for airlines.",BA,en,Business Insider

This despite Trump's hurried post-address clarification on Twitter that the minimum 30-day ban, which he seemed to indicate in his Oval Office remarks would cover goods as well as passenger movements, would apply only to people. The ban, which takes effect at 11:59 p.m. Friday, bars foreign nationals from entering the U.S. if they traveled during the past 14 days within any of the 26 countries comprising the Schengen free-movement zone. U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents will be allowed into the U.S. through 11 government-approved airports. The ban also does not affect U.K. and Irish citizens. For all practical purposes, however, the ban will apply to goods movement. That's because most goods in the U.S.-Europe air cargo market move in the lower hold, or bellies, of passenger-carrying aircraft. Because of the ban, airlines will reduce their capacity should passenger demand, as is expected, significantly recede in the weeks and perhaps months to come.",BA,en,Benzinga Feeds

Moments ago Boeing suggested that a similar moment is coming again: according to Bloomberg struggling aerospace giant Boeing, which just a few weeks ago obtained an outsized revolver from various Wall Street sources to shore up its liquidity in the aftermath of the 737 MAX crisis, was planning to draw down the full amount of a $13.825 billion loan as early as Friday. Why is Boeing taking this unprecedented step: after all, the cash is already committed and is far safer if held on bank balance sheets instead of Boeing's? According to Bloomberg, the full drawdown takes place as Boiing grapples with worldwide travel disruptions from the coronavirus, and "" plans to draw the rest of the loan as a precaution due to market turmoil."" That however doesn't explain why Boeing needs the cash on its balance sheet instead of its lender banks', and the answer - especially for those who recall what happened in 2008 all too well - is simple: Boeing is worried that banks will pull their committed funding, which in turn means that Boeing is now worried that a 2008-style financial crisis is imminent.",BA,en,Zero Hedge

While North American competitors fly the 737 NG – the upgraded version of Boeing's venerable small jetliner that has flown in various versions since the late 1960s – the MAX is the first 737 series to join Air Canada's fleet. That means there are no similar aircraft for the MAX pilots to fly in the interim. The unexpected, incremental cost to cover pilot compensation is just one of many operational, scheduling, logistics, administrative and revenue headaches Air Canada, like it's North American competitors, is coping with in the absence of the MAX, a plane that is central to its growth strategy. Air Canada's fourth quarter net income decreased CA$8 million ($6.1 million) as operating expenses increased 6%, largely due to the no-fly order for the MAX and flying more expensive replacement aircraft.",BA,en,Benzinga Feeds

The Asia-Pacific region is the world’s biggest aviation market for commercial aircraft and Japanese and Chinese firms have embarked on programmes to build their own planes. Asia’s two biggest economies are home to myriad companies making hi-tech goods, from cars to smartphones, which in many cases have succeeded in rivalling Western firms. But when it comes to building planes -- which requires mammoth investment, years of painstaking development, and rigorous safety standards -- progress has been slow. The companies at the forefront of the Asian drive, Japan’s Mitsubishi and Chinese state-owned manufacturer COMAC, have both seen their flagship projects delayed for years. China “could be successful in 10-15 years but at this time, the odds are not really in their favour”, Shukor Yusof, founder of Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics, told AFP. “The international market is just too saturated with aircraft from the established manufacturers so there’s very little space for new players.” Asia’s biggest air show in Singapore this week was -- as ever -- dominated by European plane maker Airbus, US manufacturer Boeing and a handful of smaller, mostly Western manufacturers.",BA,en,The Sun Daily

2020-02-11 17:22:00-05:00,NASA says SpaceX is just a 'load' of paperwork away from launching its first astronauts. The target launch date is May 7.,"SpaceX is just a 'load' of paperwork away from launching its first astronauts into space , NASA administrators say. NASA's target date to launch astronauts in the company's Crew Dragon spaceship is May 7, though that is likely to change. The two NASA astronauts training with SpaceX will likely become the first people ever to fly a commercial spacecraft. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . SpaceX has almost nothing but paperwork ahead of its first astronaut launch, NASA says. The target launch date: May 7. The company's spaceship, called Crew Dragon, was developed as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, which asked private companies to design and build new astronaut-ready spacecraft. Boeing and SpaceX came out on top in the competition, and the two companies are now racing to launch their first astronauts into space . But SpaceX's crewed launch will almost certainly mark the first human flight of any commercial spacecraft, since Boeing is facing delays and an internal safety review following a series of software errors found during a test flight.",BA,en,Business Insider

They said it was a simple fix and that if the spacecraft had crew aboard, they could have salvaged the mission easily. It was a non-issue, they seemed to suggest. However, new reports highlight totally new issues with Starliner, including one that could have caused a serious problem while in space. As NASA points out in a new post, the ""Mission Elapsed Timer"" was just one of three separate issues with the Starliner spacecraft.

El empresario recalcó que no tiene ningún tipo de influencia dentro de la compañía y que no ha sido requerido para las investigaciones que se adelantan a nivel interno. Efromovich afirmó que condujo el proceso de adquisición de aviones de Airbus cuando Fabio Villegas era presidente de Avianca. “Le planteé al entonces presidente de Airbus un proceso de adquisición de aviones a largo plazo. Avianca ya había optado por aviones de Airbus”, dijo. El exdirectivo de la aerolínea colombiana afirmó haber solicitado la realización de un pedido grande para obtener precios competitivos. Añadió que propuso un proceso de licitación para llevar a cabo una negociación transparente con relación a Boeing, competencia directa de Airbus. “Lo único que puedo decir es que la compra de esos aviones fue hecha de esa manera, la conduje yo junto a los presidentes de la época y el director financiero de la compañía.",BA,es,La Patria

Así fue la compra El exejecutivo de Avianca aseguró que “cualquier negociación que se tuvo con Airbus, fue siempre directa con Avianca”, y descartó su conocimiento con relación a que algún intermediario hubiese incidido en contratos para la compra de las aeronaves. “Nunca hubo un dedo de cualquier intermediario que nosotros sepamos”, dijo Efromovich.",BA,es,El Universal

Since 2011, NASA has been buying seats for its astronauts on Russian Soyuz spacecraft. The program is meant to end that practice.

Boeing says it will redirect its resources into other areas. Boeing initially beat out competitors including Northrop Grumman for the chance to work on multiple phases of the project, collecting nearly $150 million to design and then construct an experimental spaceplane that could serve multiple purposes.

The stock of the company, which operates IndiGo, India’s largest airline by market share, has gained close to 10 per cent in the year-to-date period.One of the key triggers for the renewed interest is the possibility of the resolution of the restriction on sale of promoter stake during the company’s upcoming extraordinary general meeting slated for January 29. The two promoters, Rahul Bhatia and Rakesh Gangwal, each own close to 37 per cent stake. According to analysts, the removal of such restrictions will open the doors for strategic investment in the company.This would generate incremental funds, which would come in handy in achieving the airline’s aggressive capacity addition strategy. Given its market share of close to 47.5 per cent and relatively better balance sheet than Indian peers, any favourable change regarding the promoter stake sale would act as a sentiment booster.Besides, the aviation regulator’s extension of the deadline to change the faulty Neo engines on Boeing aircraft to May 31 from January 31 has convinced analysts to revise their capacity addition guidance for FY20.",BA,en,The Economic Times India

That's because, just as we suspected, the deadly crash of UIA Flight 752 over Tehran Tuesday night, which occurred just hours after the regime launched a barrage of missiles at American installations in Iraq, was apparently the result of a misfiring of Iran's missile defense system. Or at least that's what Newsweek is reporting, citing senior US intelligence officials. The Ukrainian flight that crashed just outside the Iranian capital of Tehran was struck by an anti-aircraft missile system, a Pentagon official, a senior U.S. intelligence official and an Iraqi intelligence official told Newsweek. Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, a Boeing 737–800 en route from Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airpot to Kyiv's Boryspil International Airport, stopped transmitting data Tuesday just minutes after takeoff and not long after Iran launched missiles at military bases housing U.S. and allied forces in neighboring Iraq.",BA,en,Zero Hedge

The planes were pulled from service after a pair of crashes claimed hundreds of lives, and it wasn't long before Boeing began testing what it believed was the fix in the form of a software update to one of the plane's safety features. Unfortunately for Boeing — as well as any of the airlines who invested in the company's shiny new jets — a completely different issue is now rearing its ugly head and threatens to further delay the 737 Max's return to service. As the New York Times reports, Boeing's own internal investigations into potential issues with the 737 Max has produced another red flag in the form of a wiring snafu. According to the report, the planes have ""two bundles of critical wiring"" that may be a bit too close together. Boeing says it's possible that the proximity of the wire bundles to each other could lead to a short, and maybe even cause a crash if pilots couldn't rapidly correct for the issue.",BA,en,BGR.com

The fallout from last week's targeted US assassination of top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani escalated over the weekend, as the US said it detected a heightened state of alert by Iran’s missile forces (hardly a shock) as President Donald Trump warned the U.S. would strike back, “perhaps in a disproportionate manner”, if Iran attacked any American person or target. Also on Sunday, Iraq’s parliament on Sunday recommended US troops be ordered out of the country, while Trump threatened heavy sanctions on Iraq and said any US troop withdrawal would require Iraq to reimburse the US for billions spent on an air base. And so, with algos once again looking at geopolitical risk as something more than merely a reason for the Fed to ease further, US equity futures slumped to red for 2020, with Boeing once again dragging down the Dow after a new, potentially ""catastrophic"" wiring issue was discovered on the 737 MAX … ... as European shares extended losses and were set for their worst day in a week, with the European Stoxx 600 index down 1.12%.",BA,en,Zero Hedge

Boeing is examining if two wiring harnesses at the rear of the plane are too close together that would result in an electric short that would cause the plane's tail to malfunction in flight, said one of the sources. If Boeing decides to fix the wiring problem, it would mean that more than 800 Max jets would have to see wiring reconfiguration. Of course, Boeing told The Times that the fix is relatively simple.

Whereas almost all of the contents of that article merely repeat what has already been reported, this article in the Times states repeatedly that boosting corporations such as Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Boeing, and Northrop-Grumman, has been a major — if not the very top — motivation driving US international relations, and that at least regarding Ukraine, Trump has not been supporting, but has instead been trying to block, those weapons-sales — and creating massive enemies in the US Government as a direct consequence.",BA,en,Zero Hedge

Stock futures tumbled, giving back basically all the gains from Thursday in pre-market trading early Friday.

Volatility, which dropped sharply Thursday, scurried quickly back above 15 for the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX). One thing investors don’t want to do here is panic. Making moves out of fear isn’t a strategy. Instead, it’s often better to be prudent and let things play out.

The aide said Boeing sent the documents ""late in the evening"" Monday to congressional staff investigating the issues with the aircraft, which has been grounded since March following two crashes that killed 346 people. The aerospace giant has faced scrutiny over its decision to keep flying the plane after the first crash and to brush off safety concerns of some employees, and over whether it sacrificed safety in the race to develop a plane to compete with an Airbus jet.

Boeing's much-hyped Starliner was supposed to travel to the International Space Station after launching from Florida. The capsule, which was uncrewed but included a ""dummy"" crew member, suffered what is being described as a glitch related to its mission timer. The error ultimately prevented the spacecraft from completing its trip to the space station and, while NASA and Boeing are doing their best to put on happy faces and declare the mission a ""success,"" it was ultimately pretty disappointing. One small silver lining in all of this is that after completing a few orbits of Earth, Starliner managed to successfully land in White Sands, New Mexico, sticking a shiny bow on a largely unsatisfying trip. As NASA and Boeing explained in a joint press conference shortly after Starliner launched last week, the spacecraft's automated timer somehow fell out of sync with the mission itself.

During takeoff and landing, pilots have less time to react to problems because they're on or close to the ground and moving quickly. Despite this, passengers still have a 95% chance of surviving an airplane accident, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. Following is a transcript of the video. Narrator: You are much more likely to die eating a nice meal than you are in a plane crash. That being said, it happens. At a rate of about one fatal accident per 2.5 million flights. And half of those accidents occur during one very short phase of the trip.

The uncrewed vehicle was supposed to dock with the International Space Station on Saturday morning. However, the Starliner began flying wildly off-course shortly after separating from its rocket ride. Officials couldn't immediately say what happened, but a clock error, the spaceship's autopilot system, and a communications dropout may have botched the original mission. NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said that astronauts — had any been on board — would not only have been safe, but also able to step in and override the autopilot. The Starliner (and its crash-test dummy passenger) is now in a stable orbit. Officials say the new mission is to safely land the ship at NASA's White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico on Sunday.

The company's Starliner spacecraft was scheduled for a launch from Earth and then docking with the International Space Station. In a press conference just moments ago, the NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine broke the news that a glitch will prevent Boeing's Starliner from making its way to the space station. Shortly after the successful launch, Boeing and NASA began to report problems with the spacecraft and its behavior. Ultimately, the spacecraft didn't do what its automated systems were designed to do and Starliner will not be making it to the space station this time around. As Boeing and NASA explain, a timer that is supposed to keep the vehicle on the same timeline as the rest of the mission was, put simply, wrong. The timer told the vehicle that it was at a different point in its mission than it truly was. Because of this, the vehicle, which is in a safe orbit around Earth, was burning fuel to make small adjustments that it shouldn't have been making. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&feature=emb_logo There are still many unanswered questions in all of this, including how the Starliner's timer ended up so out of sync with the mission.",BA,en,BGR.com

After years of development and delay upon delay, Boeing's much-hyped Starliner capsule was supposed to enter Earth orbit then push itself to the International Space Station. Easy peasy, right? Not so fast. The launch went well, but once in orbit around Earth, Starliner failed to initiate the burn that would send it to its fateful meeting with the ISS. The details of the failure are still coming in, but it already appears to be a pretty severe snag. According to updates from Boeing as well as NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine, the Starliner spacecraft suffered an ""anomaly"" where it erroneously believed it was either in a burn phase or had already completed its burn. Because of this, the spacecraft was liberal with its use of fuel for tiny control adjustments.

Along for the ride will be an astronaut ""test dummy"" named Rosie. Rosie is packed with sensors that will collect data during the flight. Those instruments will tell NASA and Boeing how many G-forces a real-life astronaut might be exposed to during launch, flight, and then reentry, which should give NASA confidence that the Starliner is inching closer to being suitable for manned spaceflight.

2019-12-17 23:05:00-05:00,Boeing 737 MAX Production Halt Will Slash A Third Off Q1 GDP,"Boeing 737 MAX Production Halt Will Slash A Third Off Q1 GDP Several months ago, when news of the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX fleet first hit, we wrote that this would likely lower GDP growth by around 0.3%-0.5% in both Q2 and Q3, as the collapse in shipments was only partially offset by a pickup in the inventory component. Last night’s announcement that production of the plane will also be halted indefinitely, suggests a longer, and more acute hit to US GDP. First, some history: After the plane was grounded in March, deliveries were halted, producing a roughly 33% decline in nondefense aircraft and parts shipments. However, Boeing continued to produce the plane—albeit in more limited quantities (42/month vs. 52/month)—and placed them in inventory instead of shipping them out while waiting for reauthorization. As a result, industry-wide production of aircraft declined by a much less dramatic ~20%. All that stopped last night. According to economists from JPMorgan, Goldman and Capital Economics, Boeing's work stoppage will cut up to 0.5% from first quarter 2020 GDP, with risk to the upside as Boeing’s suppliers are already reeling from the uncertainty around just how long this production halt will last.",BA,en,Zero Hedge

The production halt has rippled down the supply chain, sent shares of some suppliers tumbling on Tuesday. Analysts told Reuters this is one of the biggest assembly-line halts in several decades, could continue to cost Boeing $1 billion per month despite the production freeze. ""Each supplier will likely be missing about 200 deliveries versus original plans, with about 80% of the shortfall coming in 2020 and the remainder in 2021,"" Melius Research analyst Carter Copeland wrote in a note. British engineering firm Senior Plc, whose biggest client is Boeing, saw shares plunge 11% on the production news. Shares in France's Safran SA dipped 1.50%, while General Electric was flat, both companies are in a joint venture to produce engines for the 737 Max. Copeland said U.S.-based Spirit, which manufactures the 737 Max's fuselage, is one of the most exposed suppliers, deriving at least half of its sales from Boeing. ""We assume (Spirit) will elect to stop production and furlough employees at the cost of $0.40 (per share) per month of the stoppage,"" Copeland said.",BA,en,Zero Hedge

No people will ride inside the space capsule on this flight: It's a demonstration meant to show NASA the vehicle is safe to taxi astronauts to and from space. Starliner should lift off from Cape Canaveral, Florida at 6:36 a.m. ET on December 20, dock with the International Space Station a day later, and return to Earth on December 27. NASA funded the vehicle's development through its Commercial Crew Program because the agency currently has no American ship to fly astronauts. SpaceX , a major competitor to Boeing and ULA, completed a similar flight test in March with its Crew Dragon capsule. Yet both companies are years behind schedule in delivering flight-approved spaceships to NASA.

2019-12-16 13:55:00-05:00,"""The Boom In Orders Is Over"" - Commercial Jet Bubble Set To Implode","""The Boom In Orders Is Over"" - Commercial Jet Bubble Set To Implode CNBC has pieced together a new report that details how the commercial jetliner boom is over, and Airbus and Boeing are entering the 2020s with uncertain futures as the global economy and air traffic growth exhibit a slowdown. ""The boom in orders is over,"" said Sheila Kahyaoglu, aerospace analyst at Jefferies. Shown in the chart below, large commercial jet orders for Airbus and Boeing took off after 2009 after central banks slammed rates to zero and produced a synchronized recovery in the global economy that allowed airline carriers to rapidly updated and expanded their fleets. Airbus and Boeing recorded more than 20,000 orders for jetliners in the past ten years, a 66% increase over the previous decade. Orders peaked in 2014/15 as carriers were concerned about fuel prices, labor increases, and slowing global growth, which forced many airlines to slash demand for new passenger jets. Aerospace and defense analysis firm Teal Group said Airbus and Boeing have about $800 billion of order backlogs. ""The industry is probably on the other side the peak,"" said Ron Epstein, research analyst at Bank of America. ""The question is going to be a soft landing or a hard landing, and it looks like a soft landing.""

We mocked the headfake at the time for the simple reason that not only was the MAX not coming back this year, but it may well never come back now that Boeing has seen its consumer faith crushed after it emerged it had put the bottom line above passenger safety. Well, moments ago the Dow Jones Index dipped, when Boeing stock - by far its most influential member - slumped 1% after FAA Administrator Stephen Dickson told CNBC that Boeing‘s timeline isn’t FAA’s timeline, and that the MAX' certification would extend in 2020, meaning the plane would not return to operation this year. Predictably, BA stock slumped even if the move was far less than its surge on Nov 11 on the now refuted rumor the MAX would come back. There's a reason for the FAA's caution: earlier today the WSJ reported that U.S. regulators decided to allow the 737 MAX jet to keep flying after its first fatal crash last fall, despite their own analysis ""indicating it could become one of the most accident-prone airliners in decades without design changes. "" The November 2018 internal Federal Aviation Administration analysis, expected to be released during a House committee hearing Wednesday, reveals that without agency intervention, the MAX could have averaged one fatal crash about every two or three years, according to industry officials and regulators .",BA,en,Zero Hedge

Increasing air travel worldwide is the key factor driving growth of this market. This rise in demand for air travel is predicated on the rapid growth of the urban middle class. According to the Brookings Institution, by 2030, the urban middle class will comprise close to 5.4 billion people. The International Air Transport Association estimates that by 2035, nearly 7.2 billion people will travel by air, a 100% jump from current levels. Moreover, most of these people are expected to be from Asia-Pacific , particularly India and China . According to Boeing, in the next 20 years, the demand for aircrafts will go over 39,000 and of these, about 15,000 will be from Asia-Pacific . Therefore, as the number of air travelers grows, airlines will look to make their journeys as comfortable as possible, especially for those travelling by economy class.",BA,en,Benzinga Feeds

Flight 610 was operated by Lion Air, a low-cost Indonesian carrier that has benefited from its political connections to become one of the world’s fastest growing airlines, despite a questionable safety record.While Boeing has faced intense scrutiny after two fatal crashes in less than five months, Lion Air has escaped similar attention, despite obvious failings that contributed to the disaster of Flight 610.An investigation by The New York Times, based on interviews with dozens of officials and airline employees, including pilots and members of maintenance teams, found that Lion Air has a track record of working its pilots to the point of exhaustion, faking pilot training certification and forcing pilots to fly planes they worried were unsafe, including the plane that crashed.Despite making vague promises of improvements after last year’s accident, the air carrier has neither fully acknowledged nor expeditiously addressed the concerns that have been raised about its safety practices, both by government investigators and whistleblowers interviewed by The Times.“The Boeing issue was an absolute godsend for Lion Air,” said John Goglia, a former member of the U.S.",BA,en,The Economic Times India

Auf der Hitliste der Vergesslichkeit weit vorn steht, dass an Raststätten oder bei anderen Autostopps Mitfahrer vergessen werden.

Los aviones Boeing 737 de Qantas con más de 22.600 desplazamientos fueron esta semana a revisión técnica, antes de lo requerido. «Hemos hallado pruebas de una grieta en un avión de menos de 27.000 ciclos (desplazamientos) y este aparato ha sido retirado del servicio para ser reparado», indicó un portavoz de Qantas a la agencia EFE. La grieta se encuentra en un área donde se unen el fuselaje del avión con la estructura del ala. La Asociación Australiana de Ingenieros de Aviones Autorizados (ALAEA, siglas en inglés) denunció este jueves en un comunicado que ha aparecido una segunda grieta en la estructura primaria de otro aparato, sin precisar de qué modelo se trata. «Estos aviones deberían estar seguros en tierra hasta que se complete una inspección urgente y se emita una recomendación sobre la naturaleza de las grietas de los aviones por parte de Boeing y la Administración Federal de Aviación estadounidense», señaló el secretario federal de ALAEA, Steve Purvinas.",BA,es,ABC

Vorige Woche hat der KURIER berichtet, dass nicht nur die Boeing 737MAX , sondern auch ihr Vorgängermodell , die Boeing 737NG, immer mehr zum Sorgenkind werde. Berichte waren aufgetaucht, wonach Risse an einem Verbindungsstück zwischen Flügeln und Rumpf entdeckt wurden. Im schlimmsten Fall könnte das Flugzeug durch diesen Fehler bei Start oder Landung sogar auseinanderbrechen. Das Problem tauchte erstmals bei einer Maschine in China auf. Die US-Flugaufsicht FAA ordnete daraufhin eine Untersuchung aller Maschinen dieses Typs an, die bereits mehr als 30.000 Flüge absolviert haben.

2019-10-29 12:38:04-05:00,Boeing CEO knew about pilot’s warnings before 2nd crash,"A pilot warned the plane was “running rampant.”In November 2016, well before the 737 Max was certified by the Federal Aviation Administration, the plane’s chief technical pilot told a colleague that a new system on the plane was “running rampant” in simulator tests. The pilot, Mark Forkner, went on to say that he had unknowingly lied to regulators.In a January 2017 email, two months after acknowledging that he “unknowingly” lied to regulators, Forkner again pushed the FAA to remove mention of the system, known as MCAS, from pilot training materials.“Delete MCAS,” Forkner wrote. In aerospace speak, he described the system as “way outside the normal operating envelope,” meaning that it would only activate in rare situations that pilots would almost never encounter in normal passenger flights.But the instant messages to his colleague show that Forkner appeared to realize in November that MCAS was causing issues in the simulator and making it difficult to gain control of the plane.The messages, which were made public this month, raise serious new questions about what Boeing knew about the new system, known as MCAS, which played a role in both crashes.During the hearing before Congress, Muilenburg, Boeing’s chief executive, said that the company had not been able to speak to Forkner, who now works for Southwest Airlines, about the messages.However, when asked when he learned of the messages from Forkner, Muilenburg said: “I believe it was prior to the second crash.”Lawmakers also asked why Boeing, which has known about the messages for months, waited so long to hand the messages over to Congress and the FAA.“Boeing should have notified the FAA about that conversation upon its discovery immediately,” Sen.",BA,en,The Economic Times India

Alongside them, gigantic cargo planes, purpose-built commercial aircraft, and military transport jets are all still needed to move shipments and equipment around the world. Read on to take a look at the biggest planes that are in service today, from the spacious and comfortable A380, to the minimalistic, revolutionary Stratolaunch. Over the past half-decade, the world's airlines have increasingly found that smaller is better for long-haul flying. Rather than moving a ton of passengers at once in behemoth planes, the better option is to offer more flights, to more places, on smaller, more fuel-efficient aircraft. However, the world's biggest planes won't disappear anytime soon.

It’s part of a broader push, particularly in Asia, to stuff more people into jets flying the most popular routes, according to aviation researcher Landrum & Brown.Legroom in Economy Varies on Long-Haul Flights“It’s all a matter of squeezing as many passengers as they can,” said Mathieu De Marchi, a Bangkok-based consultant at the firm. “It’s only going to get worse over the next decade.”Even if paying customers are less happy, packing more of them into cabins has helped turn around the U.S. aviation industry in recent years. In Asia, where 100 million people fly for the first time every year, the strategy is now the bread and butter for low-cost carriers serving an exploding middle class that cares more about price than comfort.Asia’s demand has led to industry shortages of almost everything, from pilots and mechanics to airports and runways (to say nothing of leg room).",BA,en,The Economic Times India
2019-07-27 03:40:05-05:00,Latest 737 Max glitch found rooted in its software,"By Alan LevinAs U.S. government test pilots ran through dozens of flight scenarios on the Boeing Co. 737 Max in recent weeks, a potential failure got their attention.The plane’s flight computer tried to push the aircraft’s nose down repeatedly during a simulator run, prompted by a stream of erroneous flight data. The Federal Aviation Administration pilot concluded commercial pilots might not have time to react and avoid a tragedy in a real plane.That flaw -- the latest discovered on the family of jets involved in two fatal crashes since October triggered by a different failure that pushed their noses down -- was revealed by FAA last month. It threw new uncertainty on the return to flight of the Chicago-based company’s best-selling model and sent its engineers scrambling for a fix.Interviews with people familiar with the failure suggest it triggered multiple, aggressive movements to lower the plane’s nose, which alarmed the FAA pilots and other officials. However, the nose-down motion didn’t occur as a result of a computer hardware fault, according to one of the people, who asked not to be named because he wasn’t authorized to speak about the matter.That would add credibility to Boeing’s assertions that it can fix the issue with a relatively simple software change.“We are confident that is a software update, not a hardware update,” Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said during an earnings call on Wednesday. “It’s an understood update and we’re in the middle of working our way through that.”Muilenburg said the company expects it can complete a software patch by the end of September, while cautioning that the timeline remains uncertain.",BA,en,The Economic Times India

The 34-year Boeing executive has been in the post for about a year. His resignation will trigger a leadership shakeup for both the 737 program and the proposed new mid-range aircraft, also referred to as the ""New Midsize Airplane,"" or ""NMA,"" that Boeing is developing to replace the aging 757. Lindblad took over the 737 program last year as Boeing delivered orders of its highly anticipated next generation of the venerable 737, the 737 Max.

The finance ministry has decided to waive the mandatory customs requirement that Jet’s grounded planes in India must first be sent to the country of registration of their lessors and then fly them back to India before they can be used by other carriers. This will speed up lease of Jet planes to other airlines.Simultaneously, Air India and SpiceJet have started working on plans to induct Jet’s planes. While SpiceJet has initiated the process to take over 22 of Jet’s Boeing 737s, AI is looking at Jet’s five B777s, B737s for AI Express and may even consider the wide-bodied Airbus A330. In all, AI may take 10 to 12 of Jet’s planes and SpiceJet may take a few more in the coming weeks.To operate these planes, AI and SpiceJet will take aircraft with operating crew from Jet. This, authorities hope, will help provide employment to at least some of Jet’s employees — pilots, engineers and cabin crew and the additional flights will help bring down fares.On Friday, AI chief Ashwani Lohani discussed the issue with SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar at the airline’s headquarters in the capital. “The nuts and bolts of leasing Jet’s aircraft was discussed between the two.",BA,en,The Economic Times India

2019-03-15 14:51:52-05:00,US: Widespread grounding of the 737-MAX to impact on durable goods orders - Wells Fargo,"The widespread grounding of the Boeing 737-MAX aircraft means that durable goods orders will likely be under added pressure the next few months, explained analysts at Wells Fargo. They also noted that the pause on deliveries also represents a near-term risk to equipment spending. Key Quotes: “Whether from the Defense Department or from private airlines, aircraft orders are usually a big swing factor in overall durable goods orders."" “The groundings apply only to the 737-MAX, the most recent generation of the world’s best-selling aircraft. Since the first shipment in May 2017, Boeing has delivered just 376 of the aircraft in question, though the total number of orders booked is just over 5,000, the earliest of which were recorded as far back as 2011. If some of those orders were to be canceled, the Commerce Department would subtract them from the headline figure in the month in which they occur for the durable goods report, according to notes in the report release and our discussions with Commerce Department staff.” “Considering the 737-MAX aircraft comprises almost half of Boeing’s orders in the past few years the total negative impact to durables could be substantial if airlines hold off on new 737-MAX orders the next few months.” “Orders still came in during the grounding period and the Dreamliner has subsequently seen steady sales volume.",BA,en,FXStreet

2019-03-15 13:09:34-05:00,Boeing promised software fix last year too,"By Natalie Kitroeff, Jack Nicas and Thomas KaplanWeeks after a deadly crash involving a Boeing plane in October, company officials met separately with the pilot unions at Southwest Airlines and American Airlines. The officials said they planned to update the software for their 737 Max jets, the plane involved in the disaster, by around the end of 2018.It was the last time the Southwest pilots union heard from Boeing, and months later, the carriers are still waiting for a fix. After a second 737 Max crashed in Ethiopia, US regulators said the software update would be ready by April.“Boeing was going to have a software fix in the next five to six weeks,” said Michael Michaelis, the top safety official at the American Airlines pilots union and a Boeing 737 captain. “We told them, ‘Yeah, it can’t drag out.’ And well, here we are.”This delay is now part of the intense scrutiny over Boeing’s response after the first air disaster, a Lion Air accident that killed 189 people in Indonesia. The second crash, involving an Ethiopian Airlines flight that killed 157 people, bore similarities to the first, pointing to potential problems with the automated system that requires the update.The planned fix was “designed to detect the problem,” said Jon Weaks, the president of Southwest’s pilot union, “and keep it from recurring.” Boeing officials told Southwest union leaders that they didn’t believe any extra training was necessary beyond informing the pilots of how the software fix would function.The potential similarities between the two crashes were central to regulators’ decision to ground the whole 737 Max line, a family of planes that has been in service for nearly two years.",BA,en,The Economic Times India

With air traffic increasing 6 percent annually, orders were booming, and revenue in 2018 topped $100 billion for the first time in the company’s 102-year history. Competitor Airbus SE has been distracted with the humiliating commercial flop of its A380 flagship and a bribery scandal that’s led to a huge management turnover. With Boeing’s stock price tripling during his tenure, its market value soared above $200 billion, making it the largest U.S. industrial company. It’s used the newfound clout to pursue acquisitions and ambitious projects such as a flying car. The only cloud was the crash in October of a 737 Max 8 jet operated by Indonesia’s Lion Air Inc. That tragic but seemingly isolated incident has emerged as the turning point in a new narrative after a second deadly accident of the same model, in Ethiopia. It’s a scenario every chief executive officer fears: public panic over product safety puncturing a carefully groomed corporate reputation.",BA,en,Bloomberg

It is natural, right and proper to note errors and try to correct them.(The authorities are always against “wild” speculation, and I would be in agreement with that if they had an a prior definition of wildness). Second, because putting forward hypotheses may help others test them (if they are not already doing so).

Last Wednesday, the Navy awarded Boeing a $43 million deal to manufacture four of the 51-foot Orca XLUUVs capable of traveling 6,500 nautical miles unaided. The service is eyeing the submarine for ""robot wolfpacks"" of remotely-operated vessels to conduct anti-submarine warfare, electronic warfare, mine countermeasures, and strike missions. “We are pleased with the Navy’s decision to award Boeing a contract to build and deliver four Orca Extra Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicles, and are committed to providing this important autonomous undersea capability to meet the Navy’s unique mission needs,” the company said in a Thursday statement to USNI News.

2019-02-21 22:10:11-05:00,Air Force Requests Billions For F-15X Fighters,"The US Air Force is set to request funds to purchase F-15 fighter jets from Boeing, increasing its inventory with an upgraded version of the plane it last procured in 2001, even as the service pursues fifth-generation fighters from rival Lockheed Martin Corp. The service's fiscal year 2020 budget request will include eight of Boeing's new F-15X, Bloomberg reports, the first installment of an 80-plane order over the next five years. If the budget request is accepted, it will mark the first US purchase of the fighter jet since 2001. Even though the request has the Trump administration support, skeptical lawmakers have questioned the Air Force's move to obtain a 45-year-old fourth-generation fighter for almost the same costs compared to the F-35 fifth-generation fighter. The reason could be due to its internal bomb bays; the F-35 cannot accommodate heavier weapons, such as hypersonic missiles. The Air Force is expected to purchase the F-15X without reducing the fleet of 1,763 F-35s that it has long planned, Bloomberg said.",BA,en,Zero Hedge

According to a report in the New York Times that detailed how China and Iran have ramped up their hacking efforts since 2015, when the now-abandoned Iran deal was initially struck, and China promised the Obama administration that it would pull back on its cyberespionage efforts. After an 18-month lull, China's 10-year-long commercially motivated campaign was revitalized in the midst of growing trade tensions between the US and China (tensions that predated Trump's trade war). Among the latest targets of China's hacks, according to the NYT's military and private sources, were GE Aviation, Boeing and T-Mobile.

Furthermore, even when Congress proactively has engaged to limit US intervention abroad, as it did in the case of Libya in 2011, Syria during the entire 2012-2017 conflict, and most recently Saudi Arabia's war on Yemen, its resolutions have been summarily ignored. Which is why it was impossible not to smirk when moments ago House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel said that ""Congress would not support a US military intervention in Venezuela"" during a hearing on the crisis in Venezuela on Wednesday. “US military intervention is not an option,” Engel said quoted by Reuters. ""Congress decides when, where and how the US military is used around the world, and Congress would not support military intervention in Venezuela.""

At the exact same time, the United States Atlantic Coast is being hit by the highest jet fuel prices in the region in more than a year. The cash differentials for jet fuel cargoes in Singapore, a major port for Asian trade, hit a discount of $1.34 a barrel as compared to benchmark quotes earlier this week. This means that prices for January are at their putting them at their weakest since at least 1998 , when Refinitiv Eikon started collecting this type of data. The jet fuel cash differentials recorded in Singapore have more than quadrupled over the last two months, also hitting their lowest level since August 2015 on a daily outright basis. In Asia, the drop in jet fuel prices is in large part thanks to a supply surge and a relatively warm winter, which is keeping demand for kerosene (an important component of jet fuel) lower than in past years.",BA,en,Zero Hedge

With S&P futures sliding 0.5%, and European and Asian markets sliding, it is a day of reversals in global markets as the new-year rally has stalled, while the dollar rebounded and oil dropping for the first time in two weeks. Today's decline follows four consecutive daily gains for the S&P 500 which is something the index hasn’t seen since September, and the rally of +5.60% over that stretch is the best such four-day performance since August 2015.

Twenty hypervelocity projectiles were fired from the USS Dewey (DDG-105), an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, as part of a test conducted by the US Navy and the Defense Department's Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO), unnamed officials told USNI News Monday. The test was part of an SCO effort to prove that a 40-year-old deck gun filled with high-tech ammunition could effectively shoot down drones and various types of cruise missiles, USNI News added. The report does not mention if the tests were successful. However, USNI's Sam LaGrone called the test ""wildly successful."" BAE Systems, a British defense firm responsible for the design and manufacturing of the hypervelocity projectile, describes the round as a ""next-generation, common, low drag, guided projectile capable of executing multiple missions for a number of gun systems, such as the Navy 5-Inch; Navy, Marine Corps, and Army 155-mm systems; and future electromagnetic (EM) railguns.""

In a series of early morning tweets, Trump castigating the ""failed generals"" who opposed his decision to pull US troops from Syria and Afghanistan. But as Mattis prepares to hand over control of the Department of Defense to Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive with no government or political experience, Mattis served up some criticism of his own in a farewell letter to DoD employees where he quoted Abraham Lincoln and urged the department to ""hold fast"", saying that the Department of Defense is ""at its best when the times are most difficult."" According to the Associated Press , the one-sentence quote used by Mattis came from a telegram sent by President Abraham Lincoln to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, the commander of Union forces, on Feb. 1, 1865, during the final weeks of the Civil War. It read: ""Let nothing which is transpiring, change, hinder, or delay your military movements, or plans.",BA,en,Zero Hedge
