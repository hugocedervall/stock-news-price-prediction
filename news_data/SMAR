The potential for a purchase of that size has industry watchers thinking about what could come next and analysts and experts expect more M&A in the cloud software space in the coming year. Right now only 35% of company workloads are run on the cloud, but that number is expected to grow to 55% by 2022, spurred in part by accelerated digital transformation due to remote work and the pandemic, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients earlier this week. That means the ""the overall cloud ecosystem is poised to see an influx of spending (as well as M&A) over the next few years,"" Ives wrote. Baird analysts agree, writing in a note to clients earlier this week that ""with digital transformation in full swing, we wouldn't be surprised by additional strategic M&A."" The report about Salesforce's interest in Slack comes shortly after Adobe acquired work management tool for marketers, Workfront ,for $1.5 billion, a deal that DA Davidson analyst Rishi Jaluria described at the time as a sign that companies were looking to add collaboration tools to their product stack.

It wasn't the first time that Big Law attorneys struck it big investing in a client, and it probably won't be the last. Venture capital-style investments by law firms and their partners go back decades, with Cooley and firms including Wilson Sonsini and now-defunct Venture Law Group reported to take stakes in emerging companies. Before the dot-com bust, some of those stakes were valued in the tens of millions of dollars. Investing in clients has always been somewhat fraught, with some legal ethics professionals saying it can cloud a lawyer's professional judgment and lead to conflicts. That's why firms that do take a stake in clients often take a relatively small one, and often just for part of the fees that they charge, with the rest paid in cash, according to published accounts .
