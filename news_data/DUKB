Each of these statistics points to different solutions for reducing buildings’ carbon footprint. Shifting heating from fossil fuels to electricity can cut direct emissions. More efficient building design, materials, and appliances can cut electricity consumption. And managing electricity use to match grid needs can help utilities control the costliest part of decarbonizing their systems — reducing reliance on dispatchable fossil-fueled power. The Department of Energy’s $65 million funding for “connected communities” projects announced last week is focused on all three parts of this equation.

Like other net-zero carbon goals , Ameren’s will rely on “further advancements in innovative, carbon-free technologies and constructive federal and state energy and economic policies” to reach its final goal, CEO Warner Baxter said in a Monday statement.

Utilities across the country have pushed to move away from paying full retail rates, arguing it shifts costs onto other ratepayers. Solar installers typically respond by calling utility proposals, which often propose additional costs for rooftop solar customers, punitive and unreasonable. Utility Duke Energy tossed out the conventional playbook when proposing a net-metering successor for its South Carolina territory. It got the rooftop solar industry on board. The agreement, made public Wednesday afternoon, shows that Duke's ""Solar Choice Net Metering"" concept enjoys the official support of advocacy groups Vote Solar and North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, leading national installer Sunrun, and several other environmental groups.

2020-09-16 07:00:00-05:00,The 5 Biggest US Utilities Committing to Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050,"Over the past three years, some of the country’s biggest utilities have been committing to a goal that few may have predicted they’d undertake on their own: weaning themselves off carbon-emitting generation by 2050. Driving this sea change in long-term planning is a combination of public pressure and energy economics. The falling costs of wind and solar power are pushing utilities to find ways to incorporate them into their long-range plans, even as they struggle to define what resources can be relied on to provide the dispatchable power they need. At the same time, the increasingly dire effects of global warming are bringing more Americans in line with much of the rest of the world in making carbon-emissions reduction a top policy priority. Utilities in many states now face mandates to move to 100 percent renewable energy or cut carbon to zero by 2050. Others are likely to face similar mandates in short order. If Joe Biden wins the presidential election in November and Congress enacts his $2 trillion clean energy and infrastructure ambition, utilities will need to reconfigure their plans to meet Biden's nationwide goal of zero-carbon electricity by 2035.","DUK,DUKB,DUKH",en,Green Technology Media

For clean energy resources — solar, wind and energy storage — the range of possibilities over the next four years runs from the merely good to the incredible. Renewables will continue to thrive regardless of the outcome on November 3, driven by their cost-competitiveness and broad political support, experts say. “Things have been good under the Trump administration — oddly good,” says Dan Shreve, principal at Wood Mackenzie. “They’ve done their best to try to prop up fossil fuels, but it hasn’t really come to the detriment of renewables.” The key battleground for energy and climate policy looks to be the Senate, where a third of the seats are up for grabs, most of them held by Republicans. Joe Biden has promised to set the country on a course to decarbonize its power sector by 2035, but his options for game-changing progress will be limited if Mitch McConnell from coal-loving Kentucky remains Senate Majority Leader.","DUK,DUKB,DUKH",en,Green Technology Media

The agreement should resolve issues for more than one hundred disputed projects in the Carolinas, said spokesperson Randy Wheeless, clearing the way for about 600 megawatts of solar projects to move forward in coming years. The proposed changes will need approval from regulators in both North and South Carolinas as well as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Duke originally submitted its proposal to update interconnection procedures in the two states in May. In recent years solar has clogged Duke’s queue and the utility was unable to process projects in a timely manner.

That’s a key point that Glen Snider, director of integrated resource planning and analytics, wants to make about Duke’s 2020 integrated resource plan (IRP) for its Carolinas utilities. Duke's recently published IRP presents six very different pathways toward greening its energy mix over the next 15 years, all of them reaching at least 50-percent carbon reduction by 2030. Some of them move more dramatically toward closing coal plants or halting new natural gas power plants. Others rely on options like offshore wind that are untested in the U.S., or next-generation modular nuclear reactors which have yet to be proven in any market. Duke’s IRP underscores the diverse needs of its collective 3.2 million Carolinas customers, and the mix of 4.6 gigawatts of new resources it will need to add over that time to meet their needs.","DUK,DUKB,DUKH",en,Green Technology Media

Duke’s 2020 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), filed Tuesday with state regulators, lays out six scenarios for reaching its challenging goals of halving its emissions by 2030 and hitting net-zero carbon by 2050 . All of the scenarios go well beyond Duke’s previous IRPs in leaning more heavily on solar, onshore wind and energy storage. The utility has also opened the door to offshore wind in its future mix. Duke has already committed to doubling its 8 gigawatts of renewables by 2025 and to retiring its roughly 10,000 megawatts of coal generation by 2030. But that's about where the similarities stop. The six options Duke is presenting to North Carolina and South Carolina regulators take notably different routes for adding 4,600 megawatts of new resources to its current 23,200-megawatt generation fleet in the states.","DUK,DUKB,DUKH",en,Green Technology Media

Much of the new renewable capacity being built around the world is being offset by new coal and gas capacity, leaving the global generation mix more or less how it was in 2000. Even those utilities and independent power producers (IPPs) prioritizing renewables are adding further natural gas and coal capacity, in most cases. Many companies face the prospect of gas generation assets being stranded unless carbon capture and storage technology becomes widespread soon, according to research by Oxford University’s Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment and published in Nature Energy on Monday. The research used machine learning to look for trends in the portfolios of companies between 2000-2018. It identified four clusters that the companies, large and small, fell into.

In just a few years, decarbonizing the grid went from a solar-lover’s pipe dream to something many major American utilities have committed to , from Southern Company to Duke Energy. But utilities typically pick a mid-century deadline, as do states that have passed such goals. That puts execution comfortably beyond the tenure of anyone in power today. The new study , from U.C. Berkeley and GridLab, raises the stakes considerably. By using updated cost figures for wind, solar and batteries, the researchers found that it will be economically feasible to power a reliable grid by 2035, while only depending on natural gas for 10 percent of annual electricity production. “Previous studies concluded either we need to wait until 2050 to decarbonize, or the bills will go up if you decarbonize,” said co-author Amol Phadke on a call with reporters. “I think we really need to revisit these conclusions because of the dramatic decline in costs.” No new gas-fired power plants This scenario retires all coal plants by 2035, and does not require any new construction of gas plants.","DUKH,DUK,DUKB",en,Green Technology (Feed)

2020-05-04 11:58:00-05:00,Dominion Targets 20GW Renewables Buildout in Move Toward Virginia’s Clean Energy Goals,"Dominion Energy plans to comply with Virginia’s new clean energy law by shifting to a much heavier reliance on renewable energy and energy storage — starting with a near-term solicitation for up to 1 gigawatt of onshore wind and solar and 250 megawatts of energy storage for delivery in the next three years. Dominion Virginia’s new integrated resource plan (IRP), announced Friday, represents a major shift for the state’s largest utility, which has seen previous plans rejected by Virginia regulators for their over-reliance on fossil fuel power plants and infrastructure to be paid for by ratepayers. The new plan, by contrast, sets out a goal of nearly 16 gigawatts of solar, more than 5 gigawatts of offshore wind, and 2.7 gigawatts of energy storage over the next 15 years. That’s nearly quadruple the targets laid out in Dominion’s 2019 IRP, and a major shift from a 2018 IRP that was rejected by Virginia’s regulator, the State Corporation Commission (SCC). Dominion’s new IRP is driven by Virginia's Clean Economy Act passed earlier this year, which calls for 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2045 and sets targets for energy efficiency, energy storage, and in-state solar and wind power.","DUKH,DUK,DUKB",en,Green Technology

Last March things got much more interesting when its Florida Power & Light unit announced plans to build a 409 megawatt/900 megawatt-hour battery project known as the Manatee Energy Storage Center, to be charged by an existing solar facility. In Robo’s telling, more such deals may soon be on the way.","DUKH,DUK,DUKB",en,Green Technology
2020-01-24 10:10:49-05:00,2019 Was the Year When Everything Changed for Utilities Planning Energy Storage,"For almost every year in the historical record, utilities paid no attention to battery storage. Because of this, the past offers little insight into how quickly utilities will adopt the technology, which helps integrate renewables onto the grid, deliver peak capacity without carbon emissions, instantly adjust the frequency of the system and more. As costs have fallen and early adopters liked what they saw from initial trials, though, the cycle from pilot to evaluation to widespread adoption is speeding up. The storage industry, and advocates of low carbon electricity, have a lot riding on that process. A new analysis sheds some light on how that adoption cycle works. Wood Mackenzie storage researcher Gregson Curtin tallied up utility integrated resource plans from the last three years — those are the documents where companies tell the world what power plants they expect to build in the coming years. In 2017, almost none of the 43 utilities that Curtin surveyed expected to build any energy storage.","DUKH,DUK,DUKB",en,Green Technology
2020-01-22 08:31:37-05:00,"Arizona Utility APS Commits to Carbon-Free Power By 2050, Details TBD","Arizona Public Service, the largest utility in the sunny southwestern state, committed itself Wednesday to 100 percent carbon-free power by 2050. The promise includes interim targets of 65 percent clean electricity by 2030, with 45 percent coming from renewables, and removing coal from its portfolio by 2031. With this decision, APS joins a growing list of major electric utilities committing to decarbonize their production. Xcel Energy, which spans eight states in the center of the continent, kicked off the trend in late 2018. It was joined by Duke Energy , New Jersey-based PSEG , DTE Energy and more. The APS commitment is notable in that Arizona has not passed sweeping climate or carbon policy at the state level. Yet clean energy policy has gained traction in other forums, like a recent unsuccessful ballot initiative and in deliberations at the Arizona Corporation Commission, the elected utility regulatory body. Acting now, APS can set the terms of the ongoing debate on how to modernize the state's power supply.","DUKB,DUK,DUKH,DTQ,DTE,DTJ",en,Green Technology

Implementing 100% clean energy commitments As renewable energy and energy storage resources become increasingly cost-competitive, states have become more ambitious in their clean energy targets. At least 13 states plus Puerto Rico and D.C., have now set 100 percent clean energy targets. Washington, D.C., codified the most aggressive target, setting 2032 as the deadline for powering its grid with 100 percent renewable energy. A few others, including Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, and Oregon, have announced initial plans to transition to 100 percent clean energy. In addition, at least six investor-owned utilities — Avista, Duke Energy, Green Mountain Power, Idaho Power, Public Service Co. of New Mexico, and Xcel Energy — operating in 12 other states have committed to 100 percent clean energy targets.","DUKB,DUK,DUKH",en,Green Technology

2019-12-11 07:58:37-05:00,3 Trends That Shaped the Grid Edge in 2019,"It isn’t easy to transform a century’s worth of electricity infrastructure from the ground up, particularly in the face of climate change-induced firestorms. In looking back at 2019’s most important developments on the grid edge — GTM's term for the interface of the traditional utility enterprise with the rooftop solar panels, behind-the-meter batteries, plug-in electric vehicles, and other distributed energy resources (DERs) — it’s hard to overstate the impact of California’s wildfires and power outages on the U.S. market. Over the course of 2019, we’ve seen California, the country’s leader in most DERs, wracked by a climate change-induced emergency that’s bankrupted its largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, and forced millions to go without power during fire-prevention blackouts. The crisis has left the future of PG&E as an investor-owned utility in doubt, and forced the state to confront the costs of transforming its energy infrastructure to decarbonize its economy and prevent future disasters.","DUKB,DUK,DUKH",en,Green Technology

2019-11-12 11:46:30-05:00,Will PG&E’s Blackouts Catalyze California’s Microgrids Market?,"Bankrupt California utility Pacific Gas & Electric has come under fire from seemingly all sides for the scope and execution of its self-imposed blackouts last month. The blackouts will continue as the company pursues a decade-long grid hardening project. Electric utilities bear the solemn mission of keeping the lights on, but PG&E's intentional shutoffs leave customers to fend for themselves. That divergence from standard operating procedure poses a question for the embattled utility: How will it take care of its millions of customers without power when the risk of starting a wildfire gets too high? The October fires and shutoffs inspired a flurry of commentary on how microgrids and distributed energy can save the day, by localizing power production in communities and allowing them to operate independently of the broader, fire-threatened grid. Though sensible in theory, microgrids must navigate a thicket of regulatory and logistical barriers before they become a meaningful tool during California blackouts.","DUKB,DUK,DUKH",en,Green Technology

And while traders were happy to bid up risk assets for one more day on a variation of the same positive news that has hit wires - or Trump's twitter feed - for the past two months, they ignored a tweet from the editor in chief of China's Global Times who said that ""speculations of trade negotiations will be extended are inaccurate.""
