2020-12-07 12:24:18-05:00,Core Goldman Sachs Won't Flee New York for Florida,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. traces its roots back more than 150 years to 1869, when Marcus Goldman, a German immigrant, moved to New York City and opened a one-room office in a basement next to a coal chute at 30 Pine Street. Today, that address represents the heart of Manhattan’s financial district: One block north of Wall Street and one block south of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Goldman Sachs Asset Management, by contrast, was formed in 1988.This difference is important context to keep in mind after reading the scoop from Bloomberg News’s Sridhar Natarajan that Goldman is considering a new Florida hub to house its asset-management division. The news naturally set off alarms about the end of New York City as the undisputed financial capital of the U.S., given the surprise decision by AllianceBernstein Holding LP in 2018 to move its headquarters to Nashville and, more recently, the increased presence of Blackstone Group Inc. and Citadel in the Sunshine State.Make no mistake: Goldman is a powerhouse in asset management, managing $1.46 trillion as of the end of the third quarter, up 19% from a year earlier and more than Morgan Stanley’s investment management division stands to oversee even after the bank acquires Eaton Vance Corp.",BEN,en,Yahoo Finance

""Asset manager M&A wave will continue with a variety of potential transactions,"" analysts at Credit Suisse led by Craig Siegenthaler wrote to clients on Thursday. The evening before, Australia-based Macquarie Group said it would acquire investment manager Waddell & Reed.

The plans to acquire Waddell, the parent company of Ivy Investments, which Business Insider previously reported could be sold off , sent analysts wondering which firm could be next.

(MS),"Summary List Placement This story was first published in February 2020, and was updated on October 9, 2020 to reflect Morgan Stanley's Eaton Vance acquisition. Morgan Stanley's move to buy $7 billion investment manager Eaton Vance is the latest example of intense consolidation in the active management industry, a space that's fallen under pressure in recent years amid changing investor preferences — and commanded the need for size to survive. The tie-up came months after asset management giant Franklin Resources closed on its $4.5 billion Legg Mason deal , and a week after the Wall Street Journal reported activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management had taken sizeable stakes in asset managers Invesco and Janus Henderson as part of a plan to agitate for a combination. The flurry of activity in the space gets at the pressure these managers have faced amid a wider industry shift to passive from active investing.
