2020-09-16 05:21:07-05:00,HP patents clamshell foldable phone like Galaxy Z Flip,"New York, Sep 16 (IANS) PC and printer major HP which once experimented with phablets is reportedly working on a clamshell foldable smartphone similar to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip. The company patented a design for such a smartphone with the WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization) and the patent was approved last month, reports LetsGoDigital. The HP patent describes a technology for applying flexible screens to mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets or computers. Although similar to the folding method of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip, the HP patent describes it as 'using a movable hinge that can be folded in different positions' and is not limited to folding in half. However, it is not necessary that HP would launch such a product in the market. In 2016, HP Inc unveiled Elite x3, a 5.96-inch touchscreen device that ran Windows 10 Mobile and supported Continuum, a feature that allowed the device to be attached seamlessly to a separate screen, mouse and keyboard. Earlier, Huawei also filed a new patent for a new clamshell design foldable phone.","HP,HPQ",en,Sify.com

Chromebooks and business laptops started disappearing from the shelves even before the 21-day lockdown was announced from March 24 midnight, as millions of Indians across the spectrum began working from home as corona-positive cases began emerging from various offices from early March. A Lenovo spokesperson told IANS that there has been an uptick in demand for laptops and other accessories in the social distancing times. ""Inevitably, given the rise in the need for remote and flexible working from businesses around the world, we have seen an increase in demand for laptops and supporting accessories,"" said the spokesperson. Industry insiders informed that HP Inc has also seen a huge demand and its work-from-home products have been sold out in the country.

Deutsche Bank’s Jeriel Ong lowered his price target on HPE from $17 to $15, on account of “recent hardware and market wide weakness.” Nonetheless, investors stand to take home a 74% gain should the new target be met over the next 12 months. Accordingly, the analyst maintained his bullish stance on the tech giant with a Buy rating. (To watch Ong’s track record, click here ) Despite the target reduction, Ong remains confident in the company’s model. Following a chat with HP investor relations, the analyst is “more puzzled with HPE's YTD relative stock decline.” HP’s Share price has been hit hard since the coronavirus outbreak and is down by 50% year-to-date. Among the key takeaways from the conversation, Ong notes HP’s relatively small exposure to industries heavily affected by the outbreak. To wit, COVID-19’s impact is unequal, and dependent upon size and sector. Smaller businesses with less cash flow are more likely to bear the brunt, as opposed to large companies and those in the public sector.","HPE,HP,HPQ",en,Nasdaq

He doesn’t get a little statue for that, but anyone who can get through it without losing composure arguably deserves some recognition. Powell’s walk on the Capitol’s red carpet is a semi-annual occurrence that can sometimes give investors a little insight into what the Fed is thinking. You never know which direction things might go with this kind of event, because it depends partly on what sort of questions he gets from committee members. Though Powell’s testimony and a packed earnings schedule normally would be enough highlights for any week, the biggest focus remains coronavirus. It’s the overhang of every conversation, kind of like tariffs were last year. There are a lot of parallels, especially that they’re both unknowns and no one is sure if or when they’ll end. Every conversation from companies seems to end with, “We’re going to do this…unless of course the impact of coronavirus gets worse.” At this point, it feels like we’re in a watchful waiting period, with people feeling hesitant to jump back in but also not too eager to unload shares as things remain up in the air.",HPQ,en,Benzinga Feeds

The U.S. printer maker's board discussed the possibility on Tuesday, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the matter. There is no guarantee that Xerox will follow through with an offer or that one would succeed, it added. Xerox has also received an informal funding commitment from a major bank, known as a ""highly confident letter"", WSJ said. Both U.S.-based companies did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. On Monday, Xerox had said it will sell its 25% stake in Fuji Xerox, its joint venture with Fujifilm Holdings, for $2.3 billion, after investor activism scuppered a deal involving the two companies. Xerox had scrapped its $6.1 billion deal to merge with Fujifilm last year after lobbying by two of its main investors, Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason.

Many of the companies that went under in the past decade were aging dinosaurs that couldn't adjust to changes brought about by new technology. Other high-profile casualties included startups who raised hundreds of millions in venture capital before ultimately collapsing. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. The 2010s were a decade of massive transformation for the tech industry. Advances in technology brought nearly every industry online, and the proliferation of mobile devices and social media fundamentally changed the way consumers and businesses interact. The 2010s were also a bloodbath for companies that couldn't keep up with seismic technological changes. Dozens of high-profile companies went under in the past decade. While some were doomed by their reliance on outdated tech, others were new startups that raised millions before burning out. These tech and media companies are now synonymous with obsolescence, but their decline and failure can provide valuable lessons about how fast industries are changing and what happens to entities that can't keep up.","HPE,HPQ",en,Business Insider

Since August, Irell has seen the departures of its managing partner as well as the heads of its global investigations and restructuring practices. The situation marks a tumultuous period for one of the US's most prestigious litigation firms, where lawyers are known for charging as much as $1,750 an hour. Its swashbuckling leader, Morgan Chu, is considered one of the most prolific trial lawyers, with clients including United Talent Agency, Warner Brothers, and Uber. The revelations help explain how the firm, where partners earn more than $3 million a year, on average, is squinting to see a clear picture of its future. Little more than a decade ago, it seemed that nothing could stop the undeniable momentum of the swashbuckling lawyer Morgan Chu, who made a name for himself in the 1990s by convincing a federal jury that Microsoft made a $120 million blunder by infringing on a patent.","HPE,HPQ",en,Business Insider

The 11 women on this list have a median age of 76 and a combined net worth of $37.2 billion. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . The term ""self-made"" has caused public outcry before. When Forbes proclaimed Kylie Jenner the youngest self-made billionaire in March, many took to Twitter to grumble that the term did not properly reflect that her moneyed upbringing provided her with the platform for success. In response , Forbes rolled out a definition for ""self-made"": ""Someone who built a company or established a fortune on her own, rather than inheriting some or all of it."" Forbes even has a self-made score of 1-10 that showcases someone's role in their wealth creation. A score of one would belong to someone like Alice Walton, the Walmart heiress worth $51.4 billion, who ""inherited her fortune but is not working to increase it."" A score of 10 would belong to Oprah Winfrey, someone ""self-made who not only grew up poor but also overcame significant obstacles.""

Both reports also agreed that sales were affected by CPU shortages from Intel that pushed PC manufacturers toward AMD, but Gartner noted that the pain was mostly felt by smaller PC vendors. ""The supply constraints affected the vendor competitive landscape as leading vendors had better allocation of chips and also began sourcing alternative CPUs from AMD,"" Mikako Kitagawa, senior principal analyst at Gartner, said in a statement.
