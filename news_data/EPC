2020-10-29 16:02:23-05:00,How P&G's Global Grooming CEO says focusing on men who plan to keep their beards will help it grow Gillette's business and compete with Harry's and Dollar Shave Club,"Summary List Placement Procter & Gamble's Tide laundry detergent, Safeguard soap, and Bounty paper towels have been some of the standout products of the pandemic. But sales results at the consumer goods behemoth's shaving business, which includes Gillette and Venus, have declined for much of the calendar year — continuing a streak of quarterly losses that began before March. Now, Gary Coombe, CEO of P&G's global grooming businesses, says that turning to products that cater to men with facial hair, like beard oil, electric shavers, and new razors made from recycled materials is the key to fixing the problem. ""We're in the midst of a significant transformation of the Gillette business, a business that hasn't performed as we would have wished over the last decade,"" he said in an interview with Business Insider. Early readings suggest he could be right. P&G's grooming business posted organic sales growth of 6% for the fiscal first quarter ended September 30, the division's strongest quarterly growth rate in more than four years, according to data from Jefferies.",EPC,en,Business Insider
