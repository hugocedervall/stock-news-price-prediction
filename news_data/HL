2020-11-24 08:31:00-05:00,Freetrade launches waitlist for self-managed pension offering,"Summary List Placement The UK-based commission-free trading app has launched a waitlist for its Self Invested Personal Pension (SIPP) product, which will cost £9.99 ($12.75) a month for basic users, or £7 ($8.93) a month for Plus members, per AltFi. Users can start investing with £2 ($2.55) and will also get a free company share ranging from £40 ($51) to over £2,000 ($2,553) in value depending on the size of their portfolio. Unlike standard personal pension schemes, where funds are managed on the pensioner's behalf, SIPPs allow pensioners to make their own investment decisions, directly picking which stocks to invest in and generally managing the portfolio. Freetrade has experienced strong client growth thanks to its cheaper and simpler share trading service than incumbent brokers, and SIPPs are similarly ripe for disruption. Trading apps have democratized consumer access to trading, helping Freetrade increase its customer base fivefold over the past year. With their commission-free , user-friendly apps, fintechs like Freetrade are more accessible than traditional brokers—especially among first-time investors.",HL,en,Business Insider

Short sellers generated GBP828 million (USD1.067 billion) from FTSE 100 bets last month, and made profits on 75 out of the 100 companies that comprise the UK’s blue-chip index, according to new data from London-based equities analytics and research provider Ortex Analytics. In September, hedge funds made GBP543 million betting against the London benchmark. In what proved to be a “bumper” month for bearish managers, bets against Rolls Royce were the most profitable short for the second consecutive month - netting hedge funds GBP238 million in October, after September’s GBP244 million win.

Over the past three months, dividends have slumped by 49.1 per cent, making it the lowest third quarter total since 2010, when the UK was suffering the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis. “Though by any normal standards a fall of this magnitude is terrible for investors, it is significantly better than the 57.2 per cent drop in the second quarter,” writes Link Group. Banks accounted for almost two fifths of the GBP14.5 billion cuts in the third quarter of 2020, as they remain barred from paying dividends by the Bank of England until 2021. Meanwhile, the oil sector contributed another fifth to the cuts, which Link Group says will be “longer lasting” than the cuts made by banks.","HL,HSBC",en,InstitutionAlassetManager

New data from London-based equity research firm Ortex Analytics shows almost three-quarters of total short losses in August came from big wagers against just five names: Ocado Group, InterContinental Hotels, International Consolidated Airlines Group, BHP and Pearson. Together, they accounted for a bruising GBP310 million loss out of a total hit of GBP420 million to hedge fund short sellers last month. As UK equities gained ground towards the end of the summer, hedge funds made gains from short positions in just a third of FTSE 100 names - 32 companies out of the total 100 in the index – as negative wagers in all sectors ultimately went awry.
