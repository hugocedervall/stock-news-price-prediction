2020-10-06 07:02:00-05:00,A 20-year hedge-fund vet shares the 3 stocks he thinks make the perfect play for a booming housing recovery as the US heads for the suburbs,"Summary List Placement There's no denying that the housing market is red-hot. In August, existing home sales climbed to their highest level since 2006, purchase applications shot up over 20% on a year-over-year basis, and The National Association of Realtors' Pending Home Sales Index increased 8.8% . Harris Kupperman , the founder of Praetorian Capital Management and CEO of Mongolia Growth Group, thinks the boom is just getting started. ""The core of what I do is inflection investing — finding a theme that's inflecting better and get there before anyone else realizes it,"" he penned in a recent blog post . ""With that preamble out of the way, today the government announced that seasonally adjusted new home sales for August hit 1.011 million. For those keeping score at home, this is the highest that this figure has been since 2006 and up 43% from last year."" He continued: ""I hope you get the point; things in housing are good and getting better."" Kupperman relays a plethora of factors — low interest rates, affordability issues, and years of leisurely housing construction to name a few — to support his powerful conviction surrounding the space.",BXC,en,Business Insider

2020-08-16 09:45:00-05:00,Fake News: Kansas City Southern Shares Stung By Mysterious Disappearing Buyout Report,"Fake News: Kansas City Southern Shares Stung By Mysterious Disappearing Buyout Report Tyler Durden Sun, 08/16/2020 - 10:45 Kansas City Southern stock rocketed higher last week on news of a possible increased buyout bid for the company, published by a little known Spanish media website called El Negocio. That news now appears to be fake. The company had already been the subject of a late July report by the WSJ that claimed Blackstone could bid for the company at a valuation of $21 billion. This week's El Negocio report claimed that the valuation of such a transaction could be $3 billion higher than expected , sending shares on a tear higher. But shortly thereafter, analysts began to cast a light of doubt on the source of the information, according to Bloomberg. The day after the second report was released, it had been taken down from the website where it was published. Credit Suisse analyst Allison Landry said: “We’re not really sure what to make of this. What we are struggling with is why a Spain-based media outlet is reporting on this; it would make more sense to us if it were a Latin American news source.” Blackstone spokeswoman Paula Chirhart said Wednesday: “While we never comment on deal speculation, this appears to be a fake news website.",BXC,en,Zero Hedge
