Although the index did increase, TDA clients were still net sellers of equity overall. The positive change in the monthly survey follows a month of solid corporate quarterly earnings and another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve results that helped to push the S&P 500 and other major indexes close to or above all-time highs. Picking Sides In The Streaming Wars One of the most prevalent themes in the October IMX report is how speculation surrounding the media streaming played out in investor portfolios. Chief among the month's beneficiaries is AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T ), which was a net buy among TDA clients as it released further details on its HBO Max platform alongside solid EPS number for the quarter and upbeat guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year.",TU,en,Benzinga Feeds

This was an increase of 7.3%, or 0.33, from the previous period. TD Ameritrade clients were net sellers of equities during the period, once again favoring less-risky assets including fixed income. Net buying of equities with increased relative volatility, along with relative volatility increasing among widely held products, resulted in the score increasing from the previous month. Equity markets moved higher during the period. The S&P 500 increased over 2%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.5%. The Technology sector outpaced the relative market, with the Nasdaq Composite up 3.8% during the October period. Early in the period, market volatility increased as macro-economic worries intensified following poor manufacturing data. Markets got a bump mid-month after the Trump administration announced they had come to a “very substantial phase one deal” with China.
