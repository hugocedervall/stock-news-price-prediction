And on Wednesday, he was rewarded with one of the largest blockbuster IPOs of the year. DoorDash raised $3.4 billion for its company and shares opened 78% above the IPO price. Business Insider spoke with Xu on this spectacular opening day. ""What I learned in the pandemic is that once consumers form habits, they're hard to change,"" Xu said. ""Delivery has become an additive because we eat 20 to 25 times a week so it's not all going to be one method."" Despite the struggles of 2017, by the end of 2019 DoorDash had risen to the top of the U.S. food delivery market and raised billions of dollars from top tier investors with deep pockets, including Softbank Group, Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins and Singapore's sovereign wealth fund.",GRUB,en,Business Insider

As restaurants continue to struggle to earn revenues, they've been forced to adapt their operations in order to keep their doors open. Implementing digital technology has become the core tool restaurants are using to stay afloat. The sector was already on the rise prior to the pandemic, especially at quick-service restaurants (QSRs): We expected mobile order-ahead annual sales volume would hit $31 billion this year. But the pandemic pushed restaurants to expand their usage of the technology for pickup, delivery, and even in-person dining, bringing penetration to levels not expected until 2023.

2020-08-03 02:00:27-05:00,How food delivery upstarts are fighting the tyranny of Grubhub,"“The pandemic really just crushed us,” says Sean Li, cofounder of CaterCow , a platform that partners with restaurants to deliver big batch buffet-like food options primarily to offices and event spaces across eight major U.S. cities. When most nonessential businesses shut their doors in mid-March and people started working from their living rooms, Li says he saw his business’s revenue “tank by 98% over the course of the week.” Office catering is hardly the only food business to fizzle; the entire restaurant industry is under threat. As dine-in culture has dissolved around the country, restaurants’ primary chance to stay afloat lies in takeout and delivery orders, and to pull this off, they depend on third-party food delivery services. While research shows that the apps’ popularity was already trending upward pre-pandemic, restaurants have reported an additional uptick in the customers’ use of these apps. More app use means more orders, but with the sky-high commissions that some businesses have described as “predatory,” many restaurants are struggling to make their already slim margins.",GRUB,en,Fast Company

It was a clear statement that Uber is no longer just a rides company, but a home delivery company. Now, Uber is rolling out a new design in its main app that gives its Uber Eats business equal real estate with rides on the app’s home screen. This shift in Uber’s business began last year, but was dramatically accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic. As people began sheltering in place, the company’s rides business fell by 80% in April, and Uber Eats, the restaurant food delivery business, suddenly became its most popular product. Now, Uber Eats’s success has established it as a model from which Uber can design other services that rely on its advanced logistics platform. “We’ve really doubled down on our Eats business, extending not just in food, but from food into adjacent categories like delivery, like grocery, and essentials,” says Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi in an exclusive interview. “There we’re seeing a pretty extraordinary acceleration, which is good for the business, but it’s also a really important lifeline for the restaurants and other local stores in every city, that frankly our customers are interested in keeping alive in an unbelievably difficult situation [with] COVID.” Uber’s new focus on Eats may help it survive the pandemic, in which the company has already shed a quarter of its 26,000-odd person global workforce in two rounds of layoffs.",GRUB,en,Fast Company

The company is making the technology that powers its ride-hailing business available to others, starting with public transit agencies.California’s Marin County transportation providers are the first customers to buy access to Uber’s software in a deal the company announced Wednesday. The tie-up represents a potential new revenue stream for Uber at a time when the company could use it.“This is not a one-off. This is a new product and a new business,” said David Reich, head of Uber Transit, adding that the company intends to partner with other transit agencies in the future. “Together we want to make car ownership a thing of the past.”But the effort is starting small. The program, called Marin Connect, will power logistics for just four wheelchair-accessible vans when it begins on July 1. Teaming up with Marin Transit and the Transportation Authority of Marin, it will also make public transit schedules and discounts available within the Uber app in the county, and will offer vouchers for riders traveling the last mile to their destinations from transit stops.The two-year deal will cost $80,000, said Nancy Whelan, the General Manager of Marin Transit. “We pilot a lot of things,” Whelan said. “We try to stay nimble.” Marin Transit has also worked with transportation tech companies Lyft Inc. and Via in the past.Uber has had a rocky year since its initial public offering last spring.",GRUB,en,Economic Times India

Its share price is down about 25% from its launch, as investors have yet to be convinced in the ridesharing pioneer’s ability to come good. Uber will report third-quarter results today, after the market closed, and unlike its rival, Lyft, which has now provided targets on profitability, investors have yet to gleam a proper insight into its bottom-line strategy. However, ahead of the earnings announcement, Wedbush’s Ygal Arounian issued a glowing assessment of Uber’s prospects. The analyst reiterated a Buy rating on the stock along with a $58 target price, which implies about 90% upside from current levels. (To see Arounian’s track record, click here ) Arounian noted, ""A core tenet of our longer term positive thesis on the name is around Uber's ability to morph its unrivaled ridesharing platform into a broader consumer engine with Uber Eats, Uber Freight, and autonomous initiatives to hit its full monetization potential at scale.” Arounian believes Uber is much more than a ridesharing platform, one whose true potential has yet to be unlocked and has the “DNA to become a game changing consumer distribution ecosystem over the coming years.” Certainly, its first major spin-off, Uber Eats, has gone down smoothly so far, with some arguing the economics of the food delivery business trump those of its ridesharing counterpart due to restaurants sharing the economic burden.",GRUB,en,Nasdaq

Earning credit card sign-up bonuses is the fastest way to get credit card points or frequent flyer miles to put toward free travel.

2019-04-09 16:02:00-05:00,How crowdsourcing shipping through technology will make last mile delivery cheaper (AMZN),"The proliferation of e-commerce has transformed free shipping and same-day delivery from perks to table stakes — and retailers are paying the price. With daily parcel volumes surging and customers increasingly unlikely to foot the bill, companies have been tasked with finding new ways to offer speedy shipments without eating costs. Among the most popular strategies is crowdsourced delivery, the Uber model helping online shops solve the most expensive part of shipping: the last mile problem . Like Uber and other ride hailing apps, a number of crowdsourced delivery solutions have been cropping up over the past few years to ease these pains by connecting customers directly with local couriers. And it’s not just startups either; Amazon, the world's undisputed e-commerce leader, is investing big in crowdsourcing deliveries. How much does Amazon spend on shipping? “Free shipping” comes at a high cost. According to Amazon’s 2017 annual report , the company spent $21.7 billion in shipping last year — a number that includes sortation, delivery center, and transportation costs.",GRUB,en,Business Insider

As it becomes more expensive to run a restaurant, more chains are consolidating under mega-companies. Here is a look at who actually owns some of the biggest names in the restaurant business. Your favorite fast-food chain may not be exactly what it seems. While chains like Burger King, Taco Bell, and Olive Garden have name recognition, many of the biggest brands in the restaurant business are actually owned by mega-companies. These holding companies and private-equity firms often invest in or own a number of brands, in and outside of the restaurant industry. As costs rise, scale is increasingly crucial in the restaurant business.
