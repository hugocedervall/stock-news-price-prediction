Although they only hold a fraction of the more than $43 trillion in investable assets under management (AUM) in North America, digital wealth management adoption is set to grow in the future — presenting an opportunity for fintechs and incumbents alike. Digital wealth managers, also called robo-advisors, came into existence after the financial crisis in 2008, when fintechs aimed to simplify and democratize wealth management services. They use technology such as AI algorithms and machine learning to manage users' assets, while often relying on a hybrid model including human advice to enhance the customer relationship. Insider Intelligence estimates that just around $330 billion was invested in robo-advisors in North America in 2019.",BLK,en,Business Insider
2020-12-08 12:32:00-05:00,HYBRID ROBO-ADVISORS: Here's how incumbent wealth managers are successfully implementing the hybrid robo-advisor model,"Summary List Placement Digital wealth managers, also called robo-advisors, emerged after the 2008 crisis as fintechs aimed to simplify and democratize wealth management services with technology-first solutions. And while these robo-advisors changed the wealth management game by offering such services for a lower fee, many players have chosen to maintain a human aspect within their offerings. Known as the hybrid robo-advisor model, this approach intertwines technology and human touch. The hybrid robo-advisor business model complements conventional wealth management services and can help attract more users, which will push more incumbent financial services firms toward this approach. Hybrid robo-advisors link the cost and maintenance efficiency of a purely digital robo-advisor with the human advice of conventional wealth management services. These offerings therefore often have a lower fee than legacy services, while still providing personalized guidance and advice from humans to support customers and reassure them amid market volatility.",BLK,en,Business Insider

Para o executivo-chefe da maior gestora do mundo em recursos sob gestão, com US$ 7,4 trilhões debaixo do guarda-chuva, “EUA e Japão, por exemplo, estão dizendo: ‘Não vamos emprestar dinheiro se o país continua a fazer coisas que não são mais aceitáveis em termos de padrões globais de sustentabilidade’”. Conforme Fink, “se não avançar na sustentabilidade vai ficar cada vez mais difícil acessar capital estrangeiro e os países poluidores vão pagar juros mais altos”. O executivo chamou a atenção para a importância do tema em um país com grande diversidade de fauna, flora, geografia e geologia como o Brasil. “Vocês precisam ser agressivos em sustentabilidade como país e sociedade”, disse. “O Brasil é um grande componente deste planeta e, pelo fato de estar próximo ao Equador, tem enorme risco relacionado à mudança climática.",BLK,pt,Valor Econômico

In an exclusive interview with Business Insider, DeSpirito spoke about finding opportunities in both types of trends. ""There are some companies that have benefited significantly from COVID. How much of that benefit is a permanent acceleration in trends versus how much of it was a pull-forward of demand?'"" he said. One of those permanent accelerations is in telemedicine , according to DeSpirito. ""Because of COVID, every HMO suddenly approved paying for doctor visits by telemedicine,"" he said.

And if Salesforce's purchase of the popular work-chat app for $27.7 billion passes regulatory muster, their union should make some major Slack investors very happy and über rich. Many of them are the kinds of institutional investors that often own large chunks of newly public tech companies, such as T.Row Price, Vanguard, and BlackRock. But a number of them are VCs who first bought in when Slack was a private rising-star startup yet didn't fully cash out after it went public, as VCs often do so they can return profits to their own shareholders. Chamath Palihapitiya, a long-time startup investor, had more than 9 million shares of Slack as of December, 2019, according to shareholder data compiled by Bloomberg. Those shares mostly belong to his investment firm, Social Capital, but because Palihapitiya has said he's one of the biggest investors in his own funds, he should profit handsomely from Slack's sale.",BLK,en,Business Insider

Global firms including BlackRock, Fidelity International and Vanguard have applied to set up wholly-owned mutual fund units in China, hoping to tap the country’s fast-growing USD2.6 trillion retail fund market. Jack Perkowski is often known as ‘Mr China’ having been one of the earliest foreign investors in the country when its markets first opened in the 1990s. A Wall Street veteran, he raised USD400 million for investment in China, founding automotive business ASIMCO Technologies in 1994, which was sold to Bain Capital in 2009. Perkowski’s adventures in the early days of direct investment in China were the subject of a 2005 memoir by an old business partner, entitled ‘Mr China’.

The European Ombudsman Emily O'Reilly has called on the bloc's executive arm to tighten up its guidelines for public contracts after ruling the decision to award the contract to the investment giant ""did not provide sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt as to the risk of conflicts of interest that could negatively impact the performance of the contract"".

But with the fate of the Senate still up in the air, what can President-elect Biden do to advance his climate mandate if an obstructionist Senate stands in his way? As it turns out, one of the most powerful pieces of climate change legislation a Biden administration needs has already been passed — the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. This legislation, popularly known for creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other public safeguards against financial wrongdoing, also empowers key agencies like the Treasury Department, The Federal Reserve, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to limit systemic risks to financial stability. The largest systemic risk of them all, climate change, is driven by reckless investments in fossil fuels, exactly the kind of speculative activities Dodd-Frank was meant to end in order to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis.",BLK,en,Green Technology Media

Although they only hold a fraction of the more than $43 trillion in investable assets under management (AUM) in North America, digital wealth management adoption is set to grow in the future — presenting an opportunity for fintechs and incumbents alike. Digital wealth managers, also called robo-advisors, came into existence after the financial crisis in 2008, when fintechs aimed to simplify and democratize wealth management services. They use technology such as AI algorithms and machine learning to manage users' assets, while often relying on a hybrid model including human advice to enhance the customer relationship.

Some UK equity fund managers say there needs to be the “certainty” of either a deal or no-deal outcome, in order for “never before seen” levels of negativity in investor sentiment to give way to a recovery in UK stocks. Between June and August, UK equity funds suffered their worst three months on record, with investors pulling a total of GBP1.2 billion from funds in this category. The turmoil continued into September, which saw three UK-focused funds feature among Morningstar’s ten worst-performing funds of the month. One of those funds was Ninety One’s UK Special Situations fund, which fell by 7.7 per cent in September. One of the fund’s co-managers, Alessandro Dicorrado, says that the outlook for UK equities has been damaged by the combined economic hit from the coronavirus pandemic and the ongoing Brexit negotiations. “At the moment, there really are very few buyers [of UK equities].",BLK,en,InstitutionAlassetManager

The $20 billion hedge fund that Gaonkar helps manage is known as one of the premier growth investors in the world, and its biggest holdings include names like Amazon, Paypal, Shopify, Facebook, and Microsoft. But those holdings shouldn't be thought of as only growth bets, Gaonkar said, when asked by the moderator about value's outlook. For instance, where Facebook is trading verses where ""packaged goods companies"" are trading doesn't give Gaonkar much incentive to invest in the latter, even if they are considered more traditional value stocks. ""We look at value in the sense of what is the best risk-reward vs. growth, and from that perspective. The traditional hunting grounds of just saying ok let's look at set P/E multiples and set cyclicals is a little dangerous,"" she said.

This month, US investment bank Morgan Stanley revealed plans to buy investment manager Eaton Vance, in a move that will almost double its assets under management to USD1.2 trillion. “Eaton Vance is a perfect fit for Morgan Stanley,” said James P Gorman, chairman and chief executive officer of Morgan Stanley, at the time of the announcement. Gorman explained that Morgan Stanley sees it as an opportunity to add more fee-based revenues and boost assets under management. Bing Waldert, managing director of US research at asset management research firm Cerulli Associates, says investment managers are looking to gain greater market share as their profits come under increasing threat. “The overarching theme is continued compression of fees in the asset management marketplace,” says Waldert. “At a top line, that means the revenue that an asset manager is able to raise, but as you start to dig deeper, it's also about costs in a stricter regulatory environment.” Allocators are “looking to engage with fewer partners on a deeper level”, which means their expectations for asset manager relationships are going up, and the fees they expect to pay are going down.",BLK,en,InstitutionAlassetManager

One of the un intended consequences of this near-extinction of market bears is that financial companies that traditionally make money from lending out shares to shorts are hurting, badly, as the collapse in short has resulted in a sharp revenue drop for those asset managers and brokers who mediate such trades.

For years, wealth advisors have told clients to invest a portion of their funds overseas to diversify portfolios and mitigate risk. This advice is particularly timely now given that some European countries are recovering more quickly from COVID-19 than the U.S. In addition to individual-country measures, the European Union passed an $880 billion stimulus package; the U.S. continues to argue about its own follow-up plan.

No fim de agosto, a Argentina conseguiu um acordo quase unânime para reestruturar US$ 65 bilhões de sua dívida externa após meses de disputa. Mas os títulos soberanos do país, que começam a ser negociados neste mês, já caíram para níveis problemáticos, segundo reportagem do jornal “Financial Times”.

Outros cerca de US$ 20 bilhões em papéis com vencimento em 2035 caíram para 35 centavos por dólar na semana passada e agora estão em 37 centavos. De acordo com cálculos do Morgan Stanley, o desempenho inicial é o pior já registrado para qualquer título de país emergente reestruturado nos últimos 20 anos. “Estamos um pouco surpresos com o movimento”, disse Carl Ross, sócio da gestora de fundos GMO, que esteve envolvida nas negociações. “Um curso normal dos eventos é um país entrar em um caminho melhor após reestruturar sua dívida.” Outro investidor, que pediu para não ser identificado, disse ao “FT” que a situação é algo “sem precedentes”.",BLK,pt,Valor Econômico

Its debut vehicle has a nearly symmetrical shape that resembles a loaf of bread more than anything you'll find in a dealership. And the only way you'll be able to drive a Canoo (the vehicle shares a name with the company) after its 2022 release is through a subscription that can be canceled at any point after the first month.

At an issuer level, we found that micro cap and Energy companies would be most severely affected, while mega cap and Utilities companies would see the least impact. At an investor level, we found the proposal would noticeably impact alternative and high turnover investors, while index and low turnover investors would see little impact. Finally, we looked at activist investors and found that 86% of them would no longer be required to file 13F's. The analysis below is a follow up to our initial article written on July 13th which examined the proposals impact on issuers top-100 shareholder lists.

The initial investment reflects growing investor demand for asset allocations that incorporate an assessment of climate change-related risks and opportunities. The fund will use a data-driven investment approach to measure a company's exposure and management to low-carbon transition risks and opportunities. Companies will be underweighted where they are less equipped to prepare for the transition, while those best equipped will see an increased investment. The fund is diversified across sectors, regions, and business maturities, recognising that a transition to a low-carbon economy would impact widely.

Data from Orient Capital reveals that 35.9 per cent of shares in the UK’s biggest companies belong to funds and trusts operated by North American companies. According to Jason Black, chief operating officer at Orient Capital, the “tectonic plates are shifting beneath us and ownership of the UK market is being pulled across the Atlantic”. Two US asset management firms, Vanguard and BlackRock, account for over 10 per cent of the UK index on their own. This is almost equivalent to the portion owned by European institutions, which stands at 11 per cent. “Our data shows significant change in ownership of the UK’s biggest listed companies predominantly due to the growth of passive investing driven by the Big Three North American asset management houses – BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, who together manage more than USD17 trillion in assets.” Passive index funds that offer investors access to the whole market at low cost, has soared, with these types of vehicles doubling their share of ownership from 8 per cent to 16 per cent in the last decade. “It’s no coincidence that passive funds have doubled their holdings in the FTSE 100 and 250 as well; clearly a few North American fund houses have unleashed a demand for low-cost, long-term investment here in the last decade.",BLK,en,InstitutionAlassetManager

Right away, Shelton’s nomination received pushback from the resistance wing of the Republican Party, with Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski going on the record as opposing her nomination . With unanimous Democratic objection to Shelton, it would take just two more Republican dissenters to eliminate the most interesting Federal Reserve nominee in recent history . While it’s easy to simplify the political intrigue as just yet another inner-DC Trump proxy war, the battle over Judy Shelton’s nomination - particularly in the context of the Fed’s actions over the last few months - is very useful as an illustration of our wise senators’ remarkably shallow grasp of monetary policy.",BLK,en,Zero Hedge

In light of this, there is yet more work to be done if countries and companies are to honour their critical commitments to net-zero emissions by 2050 in order to keep global warming below 1.5˚C under the Paris Agreement. Indeed, even the 5.5 per cent decline in GHG emissions witnessed in 2020 falls short of the estimated 7.6 per cent annual reduction rate needed to meet the 1.5˚C target, according to the UN Environment Program. Such commitments usually comprise the transition to low-carbon technologies such as renewable energy to reduce emissions.

The report finds that fixed income ETF assets under management (AUM) ended June at a record USD1.3 trillion. Most of this growth (84 per cent) came from inflows: iShares alone added USD105 billion, evenly split between the second half of 2019 and the first half of 2020. The report’s author, Salim Ramji (pictured), Global Head of iShares and Index Investments, writes: “Most of the 30-year history and growth of ETFs has been a story of equities. But fixed income ETFs have captured the attention of some of the world’s largest investors as they continue to modernise the bond markets and increase transparency, convenience and accessibility.” Ramji reports that wealth managers and multi-asset investors were among the first significant adopters of fixed income ETFs, observing that fixed income ETFs could help them access parts of the bond market at good value and help build better portfolios for individual investors. “For years, both asset managers and asset owners used fixed income ETFs more at the margin — for tactical allocations or temporary exposure to a hard-to-access asset class.",BLK,en,ETF Express

ETFs enjoy record inflows with fixed income and ESG taking the lead The widely reported gap in assets between the two was no slim margin, with Vanguard reporting inflows of USD90.4 billion over the first half of the year in its US ETF business, beating its ETF rival BlackRock which gathered ETF inflows of USD60.4 billion. However, questions have been raised, with Morningstar’s Director of Global ETF Research, Ben Johnson, writing on Twitter that the Vanguard inflows were coming ‘from inside the building’. Johnson says: “A portion of the net inflows into Vanguard’s ETFs over the past year can be attributed to shareholders of the funds’ Admiral share class converting to the ETF share class. This likely accelerated after the firm re-priced the ETF share class of many of its funds such that the ETF share class fee is now marginally lower than the fee charged by the Admiral shares.",BLK,en,ETF Express

What would be the exact growth curve of virus cases, and most important, how could we flatten it? By early April, a consensus had emerged around the role of accurate data, even if it could not help contain a first wave of infections. This lesson on the importance of actionable data did not go unnoticed for those of us working on industrial decarbonization. With growing consensus on the gravity of the climate crisis, countries and companies are adopting carbon reduction targets.

He comments that a small decline in fund fees adds up to billions saved. “Asset-weighted fund fees fell to .45 per cent in 2019 from .48 per cent in 2018. While this seems insignificant, this amounted to USD5.8 billion in savings for fund investors. Compounding investor savings at a rate of 4.93 per cent over the next 10 years would equate to USD9.4 billion more in investors’ pockets come 2030.” The driver behind lower fees is in the hands of investors, Johnson says. “Investors deserve most of the credit for putting the squeeze on fees.

Commodity ETP buying dropped to USD10.7 billion, down from April’s record month of over USD21 billion of inflows. Key themes in May included the fact that the buying and selling trends in equity netted each other out, creating a fairly flat month, BlackRock says, with inflows into equity ETPs at minus USD79 million. “Continued outflows from emerging market (EM) and European equity ETPs (-USD9.5 billion and -USD2.6 billion respectively) were offset by inflows into US (USD3.8 billion) and Japanese equities (USD9 billion), the latter of which was mostly into APAC listed funds and driven by purchases by the Bank of Japan, which accounted for around half of the total.” BlackRock notes that EM equities have not recorded a month of inflows since January.",BLK,en,ETF Express

Nine years and many radical monetary-policy experiments later, it trades at $1,702. That it ought to move higher, and will move higher, is the theme of this analysis. If we’re repeating ourselves, it’s in the noble cause of protecting the wealth of the readers of Grant’s. The sheer brute force of pandemic public policy is tilting the balance of financial risk. History can’t exactly predict the outcome of the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented jag of money creation (never mind the humane reasons why those dollars were set afloat). But as to the perishability of paper money, the record is unarguable. “[T]he French people,” pronounced the Bank for International Settlements in 1949, four years after the end of World War II, “remembering the old gold franc introduced by Napoleon in 1803 (the so-called franc germinal), which maintained its value intact up to 1914, and thus withstood the strain of two lost wars—1814 and 1871—as well as a number of other vicissitudes, cannot help thinking that, compared with the paper franc which since 1914 has lost 99% of its purchasing power, gold, irrespective of any short-term fluctuations in the price paid for it, is in the long run a trustworthy basis for savings.” Even so, it’s not gold but bonds that investors crave.",BLK,en,Zero Hedge

In a wide-ranging new report, ‘Sustainable Investing: Resilience amid Uncertainty’, BlackRock explored the performance differences between ESG indices and their core, non-ESG versions. The study also probed how ESG-focused investment funds have fared versus their peers. As part of the research, the firm constructed a hypothetical long/short portfolio using the MSCI World as its parent universe, which was then positioned long on securities with highly positive sustainability scores according to BlackRock’s research parameters, and short those with highly negative scores. As the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed some 34 per cent over the course of month during Q1 as the Covid-19 pandemic spread, Morningstar reported that 51 out of 57 of their sustainable indices outperformed their broad market counterparts, the study noted.",BLK,en,Hedgeweek

Zwei Vorwürfe fielen dabei besonders ins Gewicht. Die Agenturen hatten – in einem übergroßen Vertrauen auf die Segnungen der Finanzmathematik – gebündelten US-Ramsch-Immobilienkrediten beste Bonität und somit geringe Ausfallrisiken bescheinigt. Diese Papiere versprachen hohe Zinsen und wurden weltweit gerne von Banken gekauft. Das erwies sich als fataler Irrtum. Wirft man viele schlechte Papiere zusammen, wird daraus eben nicht automatisch ein solides Wertpapier. Das Risiko war in Wirklichkeit nicht breit gestreut, sondern zu toxischen Klumpen gebündelt. So wuchs sich das US-Problem zur globalen Finanzkrise aus. Und bei dieser wirkten die Agenturen, so der zweite Vorwurf, als Brandbeschleuniger. Zeitweise traten sie fast wie politische Akteure auf.

Some of the world’s most-prominent investors are raising alarm bells over the looming threat of inflation, and turning to gold for protection.Money printing by central banks and vast state stimulus packages are rekindling interest in one of the oldest stores of wealth. It’s a revival of a trade that became popular in the wake of the 2008 crisis, as money managers piled into gold for similar reasons, but were ultimately disappointed as inflation was kept in check. Yet the unprecedented scale of the government response to the coronavirus crisis is feeding the argument that this time will be different.Hedge fund luminaries including Paul Singer, David Einhorn, and Crispin Odey are among those bullish on gold, according to recent letters to investors.

2020-05-05 15:48:00-05:00,5 Reasons Why Institutional Investors Refuse to Join the Crypto Sector,"Crypto investors have long believed that institutional investors would lead to the next Bitcoin moon event but this is a false narrative built on nothing more than hope. For the past two years, crypto-media outlets and Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocates have placed heavy emphasis on the need for institutional investors to embrace the cryptocurrency sector. The oft-stated belief was that institutional inflow would lead to mass adoption and an incredible spike in the value of crypto-assets as a whole. Fast forward to the present, and the total cryptocurrency market capitalization has yet to reach the $750 billion all-time high seen in late 2017. The slow recovery of crypto prices raises a few hard to answer questions. If institutional funds have been flowing into cryptocurrencies, why hasn’t there been a significant price increase over the last three years? Either there is an almost infinite sell pressure — which shouldn’t be a barrier considering the total crypto market cap is just $248 billion — or this theory that institutional investment will pump crypto prices does not hold.",BLK,en,Cointelegraph

But despite the sharp rally that started in March and continued through April though, William De Gale, co-portfolio manager of BlueBox Global Technology, is cautioning against thinking that the rest of 2020 will be plain sailing for technology. Prior to running BlueBox funds, De Gale managed the BlackRock Global Technology Fund for nine years. BlueBox’s portfolio typically holds between 30 and 40 positions with a maximum weight of 10 per cent, targeting companies between USD1 billion and USD100 billion market cap. In De Gale’s view, old patterns of behaviour and business have broken down and will never be quite the same whether we like it or not - he predicts more automation, remote working, virtual meetings, e-commerce, online payments and medical research; less travel, desk-time, in-person, bricks-and-mortar or cash. “[There will be] even more focus on social and environmental sustainability; a dwindling outlook for petroleum producers.",BLK,en,privateequitywire.co.uk

But what has been fascinating is the evolution in terms of stock selection on ethical principles.The origins of sustainable investing rest on exclusionary screening, where certain investors avoid investing into ‘sin’ stocks due to their religious beliefs. As investor involvement has increased over time, there has been a visible shift in preference towards taking a more inclusionary approach.From ‘negative’ screening, it has evolved to ‘positive’ screening.Initially, investors avoided businesses such as alcohol, tobacco or arms production. Now, they look for companies that actively choose to pursue sustainable practices and manage environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues.What set the ball rolling?The first ethical mutual fund was launched in 1971 in the US by two United Methodist ministers, Luther Tyson and Jack Corbett, who sought to avoid investing in companies contributing to the Vietnam War.",BLK,en,Economic Times India

According to the quarterly European fund industry report from Refinitiv’s Lipper team, bond funds faced the highest overall outflows at EUR73.9 billion, followed by alternative UCITS funds (EUR32.9 billion outflows), mixed-assets funds (EUR18.5 billion outflows), and real estate funds (EUR2.8 billion in outflows). “The flows were mainly driven by developments around the spread of the coronavirus and the lockdowns of economies around the globe since these circumstances may lead to a global recession with further falling stock markets,” says Detlef Glow, head of Lipper EMEA Research at Refinitiv. Not all funds saw outflows, however, with best-selling equity global sector seeing inflows of EUR8.1 billion, and commodities funds gaining EUR5.5 billion. “These flows indicate that European investors returned to risk-off mode over the course of the first quarter of 2020,” says Glow.",BLK,en,institutionalassetmanager.co.uk

Given that this is public money held by governments, who decides where and to whom these funds should go? It is logical that workers, professionals, small and medium businesses should have a central role in this, given their critical involvement in the creation of value in the economy and that they constitute almost the entire population of North America. But they don’t. Instead, key power and authority has been handed over to a small group of private mega-banks and financiers. For example, the U.S. Treasury, which will be providing the bailout funding in the U.S., is a public institution which is supposed to answer to Congress. Yet, for much of the bailout, the Trump administration has taken the authority away from the U.S. Treasury and given it to the private banks of the Federal Reserve.",BLK,en,Zero Hedge

Fixed income suffered its largest monthly outflow on record and the first since June 2015 with USD34.5 billion out across global ETPs, according to BlackRock. In contrast, commodities had their largest monthly inflow on record (USD11.7 billion). Inflows of USD35.3 billion into equity ETPs indicate little capitulation in equity flows thus far, and recouped the outflows that came at the end of February, the firm says. Sustainable flows also continued, with USD14.6 billion added, following on from the USD23.5 billion added in February. BlackRock reports key themes this month, including credit enjoying a rollercoaster experience. The firm writes: “Indiscriminate selling of fixed income ETPs at certain points in March led flows lower across the month, as investors sought to use ETPs as liquid vehicles for accurate market pricing amid a lack of liquidity in the underlying market. “Despite elevated market volatility, trends did start to emerge with money returning towards the end of the month.” Credit ETPs have had a rollercoaster period, the firm says, with investors selling out of globally listed high yield (HY) and investment grade (IG) consistently from the last week of February through to mid March (-USD30 billion).",BLK,en,etfexpress.com

But others are wary of another leg down as the coronavirus spreads and its economic impact is difficult to predict. High-profile investors from BlackRock Inc to billionaire William Ackman have turned more bullish on equities in recent days, as unprecedented stimulus from the Federal Reserve, a $2.2 trillion stimulus bill signed Friday, and a call by President Donald Trump to get the U.S. back to work in weeks rather than months sparked the biggest weekly rally in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 1938. But other investors, economists, and strategists are fearful of advising a jump back in, with no certainty about when the coronavirus will be got under control. “People are trying to time the bottom and that’s indicative of an early bear market, when people have hope,” said Richard Bernstein, chief executive officer of Richard Bernstein Advisors. “The beginning of a bull market starts with complete despair, when you’ve killed hope.” Bernstein said he was a “data hawk” and was looking for a combination of “improving fundamentals” - eyeing the basic health of the asset, rather than trading patterns - and “total disbelief,” adding that in 2009 investors did not believe the bull market was real.",BLK,en,The Sun Daily

Nearly half (45 per cent) of attendees chose this theme, with one in five opting for US politics, ahead of the November presidential election. This points to a trend that will arguably shape the investment industry for the next decade as countries and global corporations seek to react to the growing climate change crisis. Marc Brütsch, Chief Economist at Swiss Life Asset Managers, speaking on the opening panel session entitled Navigating the unconventional and unprecedented macro-economic landscape, said that rarely does the firm meet institutional clients without ESG coming into conversation. “It’s a key topic across Europe,” he remarked. “I was quite surprised by the amount of people who selected US politics, which for us is more or less a non-event for markets this year.” Alternative fund managers are well aware of how investors’ perceptions are evolving, as they seek to make ESG criteria a key part of their investment programmes; increasingly, LPs want to see evidence of how hedge funds can be a force for good, as well as generate attractive returns.",BLK,en,Hedgeweek

They make the economic realities very clear: parents have to choose between their own future, or their children’s future. And one of the report’s lead authors went on to say that the RIGHT choice - the ONLY choice - is to choose your retirement over your kids: “ If you sacrifice your retirement savings to send your child to college, you’re making a huge mistake .” That’s a pretty sad statement. But it’s unfortunately true for most people. University education is already -very- expensive, and tuition fees are rising much faster than wages and income. According to Federal Reserve data, university tuition has risen an average of 4.5% per year since 2000 (meaning that university is twice as expensive as it was at the turn of the century).",BLK,en,Zero Hedge

2020-01-27 08:19:41-05:00,Where Does the Natural Gas ‘Bridge’ End?,"ABU DHABI — The role of natural gas is one of the stickier points of debate related to the global energy transition, and that debate was on full display here this month. Meg Gentle, president and CEO of Houston-based gas company Tellurian, argued that natural gas is a key driver of the energy transition and is already lowering emissions by replacing dirtier fuels like coal and oil. “I view natural gas and LNG as already part of the solution,” she said at the Atlantic Council's Global Energy Forum. “We’ll have some emissions throughout our value chain, but the benefit that we will have [for] overall CO2 emissions is actually 10 times the emissions that we will contribute.” The advent of the fracking boom caused natural gas prices to plummet, which has helped to rapidly shift coal out of the U.S. power system. Liquified natural gas (LNG) exports from the U.S. and Australia are now surging and making their way to several of the world’s top coal consuming countries. But while a transition to natural gas is already underway, it’s unclear what the future of that fossil fuel will look like as policies shift and other, cleaner resources become more competitive.",BLK,en,Green Technology

The contradictions and tension pervading Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week were both apparent and invisible. One moment a speaker discussed the inevitability of a transition away from fossil fuels; in the next, another suggested the impossibility of bringing populations out of poverty without fossil fuels. One conference attendee quipped while riding in a slow-moving elevator that the lift must be powered by renewables. Two days prior, a student stood up in a room full of oil and gas executives and condemned their claims of decarbonization as greenwashing. The lack of consensus among policy and industry leaders points to the firece competition that will continue to play out for decades — both economically, as energy resources go head to head on price, and in the realm of public opinion. Even in the Middle East, there is plenty for clean energy advocates to cheer. “We are on the right track,” Franceso La Camera, director general of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), said at the World Future Energy Summit. “The energy transition is here, there’s no doubt.",BLK,en,Green Technology

WeWork is focused on inking deals with big companies, betting that working with Fortune 500 businesses like IBM and BlackRock will provide more stability and value than small startups and freelancers. But the embattled office company came in under target for adding desks with big businesses last year, according to data obtained by Business Insider. ""While we fell short in Q4, you never gave up,"" one executive wrote to employees in communications reviewed by Business Insider.

Tim Eggar, a former U.K. energy minister, said Thursday that the industry must demonstrate action immediately. “…Listen or read much of the social media and popular press and our industry is part of the problem not part of the solution. Industry’s license to operate is under serious threat. [The] industry is not even really in the argument never mind winning it.

These questions are driving a profound reassessment of risk and asset values. And because capital markets pull future risk forward, we will see changes in capital allocation more quickly than we see changes to the climate itself,” wrote BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in his yearly investment letter. BlackRock manages over $7 trillion in assets. This new strategy could have a wide impact on the world of finance — and put climate risk at the top of investor considerations. Plus, activists are targeting banks like Chase and Citibank by hitting them on the consumer finance side. We check in on the divestment movement as it gains momentum.

The move sends a loud signal to markets about the risk of the world’s dirtiest fossil fuel. But it’s the first, not the last step toward limiting BlackRock's coal exposure. With $17 billion invested in coal, BlackRock was a glaring omission from the growing consensus in the financial community that coal is simply too toxic to touch. Indeed, a coal policy has become the minimum step toward credibility that a financial institution serious about addressing climate change must make. With other leading U.S. financial actors moving, and pressure to act growing, BlackRock has responded by announcing its coal policy. The announcement defines a coal company as one earning more than 25 percent of its revenues from thermal coal production, and restricts the policy to BlackRock's active portfolio, which is only about one quarter of its total assets.",BLK,en,Green Technology

At the beginning of the month, leadership of the World Economic Forum declared that Milton Friedman was wrong. The purpose of business , they said, is no longer to maximize shareholder profits above all else, but to consider multiple stakeholders and society more broadly. It’s a refrain that has dominated 2019 — from Blackrock Chairman and CEO Larry Fink ‘s letter to shareholders in January and the Business Roundtable announcement in August, to Salesforce.com founder and co-CEO Marc Benioff ‘s New York Times article in October. From this growing chorus has emerged the promise of a more fair, inclusive, and sustainable “new capitalism.” Read Full Story",BLK,en,Fast Company

On the heels of a 2018 characterized by solid growth and poor asset performance, 2019 has delivered the reverse. Indeed, growth has slowed considerably over the past year with our global current activity indicator (CAI) currently running around 2.6% versus 3.4% on average in 2H 2018. Meanwhile, a simple US 60/40 portfolio had one of the best risk-adjusted returns since the 1960s. The strong asset performance was driven in large part by the Fed’s dovish pivot early in the year. With other central banks around the world following suit, easier monetary policy pushed rates globally down to or beyond historical lows. These shifts marked a decisive turn in the equity market cycle with equity markets—feeling somewhat comforted by the so-called “Powell put”— reaching new highs.",BLK,en,Zero Hedge

LinkedIn Learning was formerly the Lynda.com training site, which offers thousands of courses on personal development, career skills and tech skills. For many years it has allowed libraries to let patrons access its catalog with a library card and a pin number. But Microsoft now owns Lynda.com and says users must register for a LinkedIn profile, with name and email, and use that to log in, allowing Microsoft to gather data on them. Libraries spoke out that the new rules violate their patrons' privacy and may even violate some state laws. Library computers are most used by those below the poverty line, a study from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation once found. Microsoft, citing safety concerns, responded to the criticism by telling libraries they can either abide by its new rules or stop offering its career training courses to their patrons.

Japan and China were at or near the top of foreign portfolio investment in the United States, including stocks and short- and long-term bonds, in 2017 with $2 trillion and $1.5 trillion respectively, a U.S. Treasury survey showed. Yet Asia has a poor record of protecting its assets stranded overseas when the cycle turns. In the 1990s, Japanese investors incurred significant losses, primarily on property.

It could cause a 'cultural backlash' between haves and have-nots.,"Vanguard is reportedly eyeing private equity, a major change for an investment manager known for its low-fee offerings. Vanguard tried a similar approach – a fund-of-funds, where an external manager oversees investments – in 2001 that ultimately failed because of fundraising issues. Potential problems with this new push include creating a divide between individual and institutional investors, since most individuals can't invest in private equity, and a ""cultural backlash"" from proponents of low fees, said a finance professor.

Colin Stewart, Morgan Stanley's lead banker on Slack's public debut, told Bloomberg we could see as many as five direct listings in 2020. To put that into context, the only two high profile direct listings in the last two years have been Slack and Spotify. Direct listings differ from typical initial public offerings in that they allow existing shareholders like early employees and investors to sell their shares quickly on the free market. The company itself doesn't raise any money and there's much less interaction with Wall Street banks, known as underwriters in a traditional IPO. Talking to a number of bankers and investors prior to Slack's public debut I was pretty skeptical that it would be a hit. This is mainly because I had always been told that direct listings could only be accomplished with well-known consumer brands (Airbnb, for example, is reportedly weighing one).",BLK,en,Business Insider

Baby Bonds There’s a large racial wealth gap in the U.S.: Federal Reserve data show that the median white family has $171,000 in wealth. That’s about $150,000 more than the $17,600 of the median black family. These numbers include home equity. One way to address this gap would be through “baby bonds”—a program to establish a universal birthright to capital. Senator Cory Booker (D-N.J.) has proposed a version in which the government would furnish every newborn with a $1,000 federally managed, interest-bearing trust account reserved until adulthood. Over time the government would add money to the account based on family income, with more going to those in lower-earning families.

2019-04-23 05:00:23-05:00,Bonds to Save the Planet,"(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- Green bonds could be a key tool to finance the fight against climate change. But good luck getting your hands on one, or figuring out exactly what it’s worth. The securities are just like regular bonds, except their proceeds are earmarked to fund projects that have positive benefits for the environment or climate. Countries including Poland and France have issued them to support renewable energy. Companies may use bond proceeds on projects that reduce emissions or enable funding for electric vehicles. Municipalities are also big issuers of green bonds. More than $600 billion in green bonds have been issued worldwide in the past decade, according to BloombergNEF. The bonds have something of a built-in customer base of socially conscious investors including pensions and nonprofits. These investors tend to snap them up—most new green bond issues are oversubscribed—and hold them until they come due. This has put the market in a somewhat awkward spot: The bonds are clearly popular, but since they don’t trade much, it’s hard to get a precise view of their market value at any given moment.",BLK,en,Bloomberg

2019-02-23 17:10:00-05:00,Is Hong Kong's Best-Performing Stock A Giant Pyramid Scheme?,"Who in their right mind would buy an investment company at 90x NAV? A better question for China Ding Yi Feng Holdings shareholders would be who other than unwitting index-fund managers and the retail investors who buy their products? In a stunning report published Friday, Bloomberg highlighted what we imagine is one of the most egregiously overvalued stocks in the world (a world where Tesla is also a publicly traded company). Despite being comprised of mostly money-losing investments, China Ding Yi Feng has seen its shares smash through one all-time high after the next over the past five years. In that time, it has rallied 8,563%. But as BBG points out, there is no obvious catalyst for this rally. By every sensible investing metric, the company's shares should be in free fall. But ask local market veterans about China Ding Yi Feng Holdings Ltd., and they’ll tell you the rally makes little sense. The investment-holding company has lost money for seven of the past eight years; its stock trades at one of highest valuations worldwide; and DYF’s chairman, a Taoist scholar who boasts investing skills on par with those of Warren Buffett and George Soros, has recently been the subject of several critical reports in Chinese media.

Steadily rising payouts pay off down the road, too. Not only do rising dividends lift the yield on an investor's original cost basis, they're indicative of a firm's ability to withstand the economy's - and the market's - inevitable ups and downs. ""Dividend growers tend to be quality franchises built to weather diverse market environments,"" BlackRock portfolio manager Tony DeSpirito and now-retired BlackRock PM Robert Shearer wrote in a 2015 report. ""If you think about it, these are generally high-quality businesses with ample free cash flow, and that's precisely what's needed to grow the dividend. So you have a very attractive combination of quality franchises, solid balance sheets and positive trends in cash flow and earnings.""

Recall that whereas last week EPFR reported that total stock funds suffered record weekly outflows of $39 billion, this was the result of $53 billion in active fund outflows offset by $14 billion in ETF in flows, as the great rotation from active to passive continues.
