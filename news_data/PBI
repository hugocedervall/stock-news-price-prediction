2020-11-06 17:10:53-05:00,Trackers review – full-speed South African thriller ratchets up the tension,"Despite the odd cheesy exchange, Sky’s latest import is a solid drama set against an action-packed backdrop of espionage, terrorism and political intrigue In this least stressful of weeks, why not try Trackers (Sky Atlantic), a South African spy thriller that ladles on the tension, and should raise heart rates to at least to the same level as the rolling news. This knotty adaptation of Deon Meyer’s novel weaves together the stories of three characters, seemingly disconnected at the start, against a backdrop of spying, Islamic terrorism and political intrigue in Cape Town and beyond. It has more than a touch of the homelands to it. In rural Loxton, a man with a thousand-yard stare and a Fassbender air called “Lemmer” – though that may not be his real name – almost starts a bar brawl, until an older man and woman mysteriously hold him back. In the Cape Town suburbs, Milla walks out of the family home, leaving her son and husband behind, with nothing but a note on the pillow to explain herself.",PBI,en,The Guardian

2019-12-14 18:01:00-05:00,Branche feilt an Zustellprognose,"Bonn (dpa) - Das Prinzip Hoffnung ist beim Paketbestellen allgegenwärtig. Die Hoffnung, dass die Sendung zuverlässig ankommt – und dass der Zusteller klingelt, wenn man selbst oder zumindest der Nachbar daheim ist. Hohe Investitionen der Paketbranche sollen nun dazu führen, dass Empfänger nicht bloß hoffen müssen, sondern genau wissen, wann der Paketbote da sein wird. Ob Deutsche Post DHL, DPD oder Hermes – sie alle wollen ihre Vorhersagen verbessern. Das lohnt sich für sie: Bei präziser Prognose steigt die Erstzustellquote, und die Mitarbeiter verlieren weniger Zeit bei der Zustellung. Stand heute setzt die Paketbranche in Deutschland auf mehr oder minder grobe Zeitfenster, die bei 1 bis 12 Stunden liegen. Warum eigentlich? Die Zusteller fahren doch jeden Tag ähnliche Routen – und die Datenauswertung samt Verkehrsprognose wird im Digitalzeitalter immer besser. So einfach ist das aber nicht, sagen Experten. ""Das ist eine sehr komplexe Angelegenheit mit vielen Variablen"", erläutert der Frankfurter Logistik-Professor Kai-Oliver Schocke. ""Gibt es Staus oder Umleitungen, findet der Fahrer einen Parkplatz, wo genau müssen wie viele Pakete abgegeben werden – und wie lange dauert es unter diesen Bedingungen bis zur nächsten Zustellung? – Solche Fragen können noch nicht zuverlässig und präzise beantwortet werden.""

2019-05-23 08:00:00-05:00,Changes in Legislature Open New Doors for CBD Manufacturers,"NEW YORK , May 23, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Hemp, a derivative of the cannabis plant, has been used for centuries due to its numerous applications. The diverse use of the hemp plant makes it one of the most versatile resources as it is most commonly used for applications such as clothing, plastic, paper, and construction materials. However, nowadays, hemp is most commonly thought of as a derivative of the cannabis plant. Hemp is one of the two main derivatives of the plant and is widely different in terms of its biological makeup from its counterpart, marijuana. Hemp primarily contains CBD or cannabidiol, while marijuana contains more THC or tetrahydrocannabinol. The difference between CBD and THC is that the former does not cause psychoactive effects for its user. As a result, most U.S. states have legalized the use of hemp-derived CBD products as long as it contains less than 0.3% THC levels. Furthermore, the recent passage of the U.S. Farm Bill in 2018 opened up a major gateway for the CBD industry.",PBI,en,Benzinga

However, the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs deemed cannabis as an illegal drug back in 1961. Originally, the treaty intended to cover drugs such as opium, coca, and others such as morphine, heroin, and cocaine. Unfortunately, cannabis was classified under the group of narcotics because of its psychoactive effects. However, the convention does recognize the medical use and research of certain drugs. Typically, drugs such as opioids are heavily prevalent within medical institutions as they are primarily used to treat moderate to severe chronic pain. However, extensive research has suggested that cannabis can be an effective alternative to opioids.

CBD, or cannabidiol, is a non-addictive compound found in the resinous flower of the cannabis plant. Due to its therapeutic benefits, many medical institutions have sought to use CBD as an alternative to traditional treatments. Generally, when compared to its fellow component, THC or tetrahydrocannabinol, CBD has significantly lower levels of THC, meaning that it does not provide consumers with the psychoactive effects often associated with cannabis. Moreover, due to THC's biological makeup, multiple government agencies have banned the substance, prompting many cannabis-based companies to integrate hemp or CBD operations into their business portfolios. Now, consumers can easily find CBD-based products at their local convenience stores or pharmacies. Nonetheless, these products are expected to contain less than 0.3% THC levels, which is the legal limit for commercially sold CBD-based products, while typically, most retailers and dispensaries offer products containing 18:1, 8:1, 4:1, 2:2, or 1:1 CBD to THC ratios, according to Care By Design Chief Executive Officer Chad Connor .",PBI,en,Benzinga

Researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institutes of Health, Stanford Division of Pain Medicine, Kaiser Permanente, and Yale University concluded that chronic pain problems actually limited certain daily tasks in patients' lives. Traditionally, most patients who suffer from chronic pain are prescribed opioids like hydrocodone and oxycodone in order to suppress the pain. While opioids are effective in numbing the pain, extensive research has suggested that frequent use of opioids results in negative side effects. Short-term use of opioids includes side effects like drowsiness and sedation. On the other hand, long-term use can result in liver and brain damage, development of tolerance, and dependence.
