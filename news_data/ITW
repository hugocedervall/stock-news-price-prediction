2019-03-22 06:33:08-05:00,New York and Chicago may see the Northern Lights this weekend due to an unusual geomagnetic storm,"A giant cloud of charged particles known as a coronal mass ejection (CME) is coming on Saturday, which means people in some parts of the northern US may see the Northern Lights then, the NOAA said. The phenomenon is due to the combination of the oncoming CME and a small solar flare that struck earlier this week. Seeing the Northern Lights ""is not a guarantee but conditions are favorable,"" meteorologist Joe Charlevoix said. Cities as far south as New York and Chicago may see the Northern Lights on Saturday due to an unusual geomagnetic storm, meteorologists said. A giant cloud of charged particles from the solar corona — the layer of gas surrounding the sun — known as a coronal mass ejection (CME) is expected to arrive on Saturday. This in turn could increase the reach and intensity of the aurora borealis, also known as the Northern Lights, to parts of the northern US over the weekend , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said . Meteorologist Joe Charlevoix tweeted that the Northern Lights would likely be visible on Saturday night. ""This is not a guarantee but conditions are favorable,"" he said.",ITW,en,Business Insider

2019-02-07 08:21:30-05:00,Moody’s Warns Illinois Governor: New Taxes Will Make More Residents Flee,"Authored by Ted Dabrowski and John Klingner via WirePoints.com, New Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker got a warning of sorts from Moody’s ahead of the governor’s first budget address. The rating agency’s most recent report highlighted the usual crises Pritzker must tackle: ballooning pension debts and chronic budget deficits. Moody’s rates Illinois just one notch above junk largely due to the state’s finances and malgovernance. Moody’s says new revenue likely will be required to achieve stability, as you’d expect, because rating agencies love higher taxes. But for the first time, the agency has included outmigration among its top-three credit concerns. That matters because Pritzker’s number one prescription to “fix” Illinois is tax hikes , something that’s sure to accelerate Illinois’ out-migration trend and further erode the state’s tax base. Moody’s calls it a “conundrum” for Illinois. From their report: “… the population loss and relatively sluggish employment trends suggest a degree of economic vulnerability that poses a conundrum : revenue growth from existing sources will be too tepid to offset escalating fixed costs, while new taxes could threaten to increase the outflow of residents.” These new comments are significant because Moody’s has long considered tax hikes a budget-balancing option for the state.",ITW,en,Zero Hedge

2019-01-13 16:20:00-05:00,"Illinois Is ""National Outlier"" When It Comes To Losing Residents","Authored by Ted Dabrowski and John Klingner via WirePoints.com, Illinois residents are fleeing the state in record numbers. The most recent U.S. Census numbers showed Illinois netted a loss of 114,000 residents to other states in 2018. That means Illinois lost 114,000 more residents than it gained from other states. Only New York, (-180,000) and California (-156,000) lost more residents on a net basis. New Jersey (-50,000) and Louisiana (-28,000) rounded out the top five largest losers of residents to other states. How does Illinois rank under an apples-to-apples comparison based on population? Illinois is still the nation’s third-biggest loser. No matter how you cut the numbers, Illinois is an outlier when it comes to losing people. Illinois lost nine residents per 1,000 in population in 2018, third only to Alaska (-14.6) and New York (-9.2). Hawaii and Rhode Island rounded out the nation’s five-worst losers of residents to outmigration. In contrast, 22 states netted resident gains from other states.",ITW,en,Zero Hedge
