The report, released on Wednesday by the World Resources Institute , said indigenous people should be given more legal rights to manage and use their lands, and called for better environmental safeguards.

In addition to Berkshire Hathaway's addition of Barrick Gold, Bridgewater also invested in gold backed ETFs during the second quarter. In fact, holding up gold's price is interest from the West that is offsetting softer demand from the East , according to FT . The demand coming out of the West has been spurred by the impact of the coronavirus and, more specifically, the idea of a path to endless money printing. David Tait, chief executive of the World Gold Council, told FT that gold's rally ""has focused a lot of people who had historically looked at gold as the Armageddon trade to look at it through a broader lens"". In places like India and China, however, demand for gold has been relatively soft.

Descoberta de novas reservas está cada vez mais rara Getty Images via BBC No mês passado, o preço do ouro atingiu seu recorde, ultrapassando US$ 2.000 a onça (28,4 gramas), cerca de R$ 11 mil. Embora esse aumento no preço tenha sido impulsionado pelos operadores de mercado, o pico no preço traz de volta o questionamento sobre a disponibilidade do metal precioso — e como estamos perto de esgotar suas reservas minerais na Terra. A demanda de ouro está em alta como um investimento, um símbolo de status e um componente-chave em muitos produtos eletrônicos. Mas também é um recurso finito e, eventualmente, chegará um estágio em que não haverá mais nada para explorar. Nível máximo?

2020-09-07 04:37:22-05:00,The golden truth: Bonds appear ‘riskier’ than stock,"By Saikat Das and Ashok BhattacharjeeMumbai: Barrick Gold Corp. isn’t either Apple or Microsoft, and not many had heard about the Canadian miner until about a couple of weeks ago. Since then, a routine Berkshire Hathaway filing on its quarterly stock holdings has seemingly transformed this Toronto-based company into a glittering ambassador for gold as a fail-safe investment globally.But is gold really a better inflation hedge than common stock? Or, do the unusual simultaneous rallies in gold and stocks help explain their complex interrelationships with bonds? To arrive at a definitive conclusion, a careful examination of Warren Buffet’s so-called change of heart on gold is necessary. First, he didn’t simply buy tonnes of idle gold; he just put in some money into the equity of a significant miner which, besides mining gold, also digs out copper, a metal with multiple industrial applications. Second, the Oracle of Omaha didn’t suddenly turn bearish on equities: A detailed analysis of the customary filing by Forbes clearly showed that the legendary investor remains wedded to stocks, including banks and financials, even at 90.Therefore, Berkshire Hathaway’s Barrick Gold investment doesn’t dilute equity’s well-established credentials as a growth asset – and an effective inflation hedge.",GOLD,en,Economic Times India

The reduction is a 42% drop in Berkshire's last disclosed position of 237.6 million shares; Berkshire's stake is now 3.3% of Wells stock, down from 5.96% previously. Considering that for years Wells Fargo was synonymous with Buffett's long-running bet on US banks - and on America in general - the move is certainly ominous for all those predicting an imminent bank stock renaissance (and comes at a time when Buffett is also pivoting toward Japan's largest trading houses).",GOLD,en,Zero Hedge
