These strategies may be controversial, but they also seem to work; Netflix, founded in 1997, has reached a $227 billion market cap since going public in 2002. On a recent episode of the podcast Starting Up , Hastings told Insider's Global Editor-in-Chief Nich Carlson about his new book "" No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention ,"" which he co-wrote with author Erin Meyer. The book dives into the policies that made the company unique. For example, Netflix's ""Keeper Test"" urges managers to frequently evaluate whether they should fire or keep employees. ""If you're going to be the coach of the team that wins the Olympics, you better have incredible players at every position or you're not going to win the gold medal,"" Hastings told Carlson. ""We're trying to win the championship of film and television…and to do that we have to have an Olympic caliber team."" While Hastings runs a wildly successful company — Netflix added nearly as many new subscribers in the first half of this year as it did in all of 2019 — he's also galvanized by other business leaders.","HP,HPE",en,Business Insider

And by hates, I mean structurally despises it, from soup to nuts: venture capitalists pretty much want to invest only in startups that promise to completely dominate markets, raking in as close to 100% of potential gains as possible. It wasn't always like this: The first wave of technology firms, from Hewlett-Packard to Apple to Microsoft, emerged from the model of fierce, government-monitored competition, leading to a lot of innovation and a beneficial mix of great products and great prices. That's how we got computers on our desks, on our laps, and in our pockets when, decades ago, they required entire buildings. The second wave of tech innovation, based on the internet and later mobile computing, turned venture capitalists into venture monopolists. That why we now have so few companies providing vast numbers of uses with essential digital products and services. And this state of affairs has been valorized, notably by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who infamously (and influentially) argued in 2014 that the conventional wisdom concerning monopolies is bogus. ""All happy companies are different: Each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem,"" he wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed to support his book, Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future.

Smaller businesses with less cash flow are more likely to bear the brunt, as opposed to large companies and those in the public sector.","HPE,HP,HPQ",en,Nasdaq

2019-04-01 10:57:56-05:00,HP's former CEO says he would have abandoned the calamitous $11 billion deal that put the firm in a tailspin,"Former HP CEO Leo Apotheker has said he would have abandoned the firm's disastrous acquisition of British software firm Autonomy if he had been aware of its alleged fraudulent dealings. Apotheker was the prime architect of the Autonomy acquisition in 2011, but was booted out before the deal closed. HP subsequently wrote $8.8 billion off Autonomy's value. Apotheker appeared as a witness for HP during its $5 billion civil suit against former Autonomy CEO Mike Lynch and former CFO Sushovan Hussain. He is considered to be one of the most disastrous CEOs in tech, and his rationale for pushing the deal through is under the microscope in court. History has not been kind to Leo Apotheker. The German-born tech executive is best known as the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, and one of the shortest-tenured bosses in tech after being booted out after just 12 months . His hasty departure came in 2012 after he and then-chief technology officer, Shane Robison, oversaw HP's $11 billion acquisition of British software company Autonomy in 2011.","HP,HPE",en,Business Insider

HP has accused Autonomy's former CEO Mike Lynch and its former CFO Sushovan Hussain of overstating the software firm's value.

HP also argued that Lynch and Hussain perpetrated several ""improper transactions"" that made Autonomy's software business look healthier than it really was. Lynch and Hussain have denied all of HP's allegations. Hewlett-Packard's $5 billion legal battle against two of its own former executives kicked off on Monday in London's High Court. It's the UK's biggest fraud trial, centring on HP's $11 billion acquisition of British software firm Autonomy.

Operation Cloudhopper, as it's called, is one of the most extensive Chinese hacking campaigns ever exposed. The DOJ has already brought charges against some of the hackers allegedly responsible (though it's unlikely they will ever see the inside of a US courtroom or jail cell). During Cloudhopper's heyday, the MSS-affiliated hacking group known only as ""ATP10"" (Advanced Persistent Threat 10), infiltrated storied US firms including IBM and HP. It was widely believed by intelligence officials that ATP targeted MSPs in Europe, Asia and beyond, as well as the US.
