2020-12-01 17:57:05-05:00,Salesforce's chief financial officer Mark Hawkins is stepping down and will be replaced by chief legal officer Amy Weaver (CRM),"Summary List Placement Salesforce dropped two major announcements when it reported earnings on Tuesday afternoon. The first, and most dramatic, is that the cloud software giant announced its intention to acquire workplace messaging app Slack for $27.7 billion in cash and stock . The second, however, will see a shakeup to Salesforce's highest levels of leadership, as president and chief financial officer Mark Hawkins announced that he will be stepping down, effective January 31, 2021, per a filing with the Securities and Exchange Comission (SEC). It's not clear where he's going next. He will be replaced by Amy Weaver, who had been serving as Salesforce's president and chief legal officer since 2017, and its general counsel before that. Hawkins had been with Salesforce since 2014, with a decades-long career at companies like Autodesk, Logitech, Dell, and Hewlett-Packard before that. Notably, he will still be considered a full-time employee of Salesforce through the end of April, according to the filing, after which he will be made ""reasonably available"" to the company through the end of October in an advisory role.","HPE,UNVR",en,Business Insider
