For investors who are looking for companies that are going to turn around their fortunes in the near future, Deep Mehta at Goldman Sachs recently identified some of the stocks that could have a chance at a dramatic reversal. Mehta names a series of stocks that get top ratings from Goldman's analysts, who are substantially more optimistic about the stocks and the companies' future earnings than Wall Street at large. ""These names appear underappreciated by the market and could generate alpha for investors with a contrarian view,"" Mehta said. Each of the following 16 stocks is rated ""Buy"" by Mehta's firm, and seven of them — EOG Resources, Raytheon, Amgen, Alphabet, Oracle, Axalta, and Wingstop — get an even bigger vote of confidence because they're on the ""Conviction Buy"" list.",EOG,en,Business Insider

2020-10-07 10:10:00-05:00,Morgan Stanley expects more mega-mergers in the oil industry. Here are the 11 deals the bank says are most likely.,"Summary List Placement Hammered by a collapse in oil prices, the energy industry is entering a new phase focused on returns, which is likely to bring a wave of consolidation, analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note Wednesday. Deals could help US oil companies Exxon and Chevron diversify and build out their clean-energy assets, they said. ""European peers have begun to reposition portfolios away from oil & gas production,"" the analysts said in the note. ""Majors in the US have been slower to adapt despite sharing similar advantages of scale. Focusing on M&A in the power sector, companies with renewable development capabilities could be particularly attractive alternatives to oil & gas."" Today, the energy industry remains fragmented, the analysts said, resulting in a recent spike in deals. Most notably, Chevron acquired Noble Energy in early October through a $5 billion all-stock deal, while shale giants Devon Energy and WPX Energy announced plans to merge in late September.

2020-06-09 09:45:00-05:00,Oil prices are recovering faster than anyone expected. 4 Wall Street banks explain what that means for the energy economy — and share the stocks poised to benefit from the recovery.,"After crashing in March, the price of crude oil is recovering faster than banks initially predicted. Some producers that were forced to pare back oil production are already reversing cuts as a result. Still, don't expect oil demand to fully recover before the end of next year, analysts say. It could take even longer before US production grows. For more stories like this, sign up here for our weekly energy newsletter, Power Line . It was a devastating spring for oil markets, as some futures reached record lows and companies responded by laying off staff, slashing dividends , and cutting billions from annual budgets. But now there's some good news: The price of crude is rising fast — faster than investors expected. The US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate (WTI), posted its sharpest monthly gains on record in May. And when markets opened Tuesday morning, just days after OPEC Plus agreed to extend record supply cuts through July, WTI was trading at about $38 a barrel — up another 8% or so, since the start of June. ""The oversupply, which sent WTI oil prices into the negative earlier this year, is a thing of the past, as long as OPEC+ compliance stays strong and the oil demand recovery trajectory isn't radically altered,"" the research firm Rystad Energy said in a statement on Monday.",EOG,en,Business Insider

2019-03-05 17:45:00-05:00,"Shale Companies In Turmoil As Newer Wells ""Drink Their Milkshake""","US shale companies' decision to drill thousands of new wells closely together - and close to already existing wells - is turning out to be a bust ; worse, this approach is hurting the performance of wells already in existence, posing an even greater threat to the already struggling industry. In order to keep the United States as an energy supplying powerhouse, shale companies have pitched bunching wells in close proximity, hoping they would produce as much as older ones, allowing companies to extract more oil overall while maintaining good results from each well. These types of predictions helped fuel investor interest in shale companies, who raised nearly $57 billion from equity and debt financing in 2016 – up from $34 billion five years earlier, when oil was over $110 per barrel. In 2016, oil prices dipped below $30 a barrel at one point. And now - surprise – the actual results from these wells are finally coming in and they are quite disappointing. Newer wells that have been set up near older wells were found to pump less oil and gas, and engineers warn that these new wells could produce as much as 50% less in some circumstances.",EOG,en,Zero Hedge

2019-02-26 07:38:25-05:00,"""Quadruple Top"": Stocks Fall As Trade Optimism Fizzles, Powell Looms","Was that it for the ""trade war optimism"" euphoria? While traders were delighted to buy the rumor and then buy the news of the China March 1 tariff extension, expecting an imminent trade deal between the US and China, sentiment soured on Tuesday as world shares took a breather on Tuesday after hitting a five-month high, with global markets dropping as the rush of optimism over U.S.-China trade talks turned to pessimism, leading to a sea of red in world markets with even the Chinese stock bubble pausing overnight, while in FX the pound soared, hitting the highest against the Euro since 2017, as the May government gave signs it was willing to delay Brexit. Europe's Stoxx 600 Index slumped and S&P 500 Index futures drpoped after President Trump raised the possibility of signing a new trade deal with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, but cautioned an agreement “ might not happen at all.” “It looks like they will be coming back quickly again,” Trump told reporters Monday , referring to the possibility of Chinese negotiators returning after a week of talks on trade. “We are going to have a signing summit, which is even better,” he said, adding: “We are getting very very close.” However, the president promptly tempered his enthusiasm, noting that a deal “ might not happen at all.” As Bloomberg notes, with Trump set to hold another summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un this week, a diplomatic effort in which China will play a critical role, the risk of a setback remains significant.",EOG,en,Zero Hedge
