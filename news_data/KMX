Some insiders were making return trips to the buy window last week. Some of those purchases were made by C-level executives. Conventional wisdom says that insiders and 10% owners really only buy shares of a company for one reason -- they believe the stock price will rise and they want to profit from it. So insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors, particularly when markets are near all-time highs. Insiders continued to add shares despite market volatility and economic uncertainty. Here are some of the most noteworthy insider purchases reported in the past week. Last week, new director Brett Icahn purchased more than 202,700 Icahn Enterprises LP (NASDAQ: IEP ) depositary units at $49.32 apiece. That totaled around $10 million. Those units were sold by board chair Carl Icahn, father of that director. Note that Carl Icahn purchased Xerox shares last month.

Indeed, at a time when most hedge funds were panic selling, executives - who know their company prospects better than literally anyone else - were hitting the clearance rack and buying shares of their own companies at what Bloomberg called a ""breakneck"" pace, with total insider buys outpacing sales by the most since 2011.

In a bizarre - and for now successful - attempt to pump HTZ stock, Jefferies analysts Hamzah Mazari and Bret Jordan wrote this morning that the bankrupt company could sell its roughly 150,000-car inventory and somehow pocket $3 billion in proceeds (roughly $20K per used car) as it looks to stay afloat after filing for bankruptcy. According to the Mazari and Jordan, who probably did not know that one of their roles as a ""research analyst"" would be to moonlight as the world's biggest used car salesmen, ""channel checks"" suggest used-car firms like CarMax and AutoNation could be among the firms looking to purchase used Hertz vehicles amid rise in demand for used cars. The very hypothetical move could, in theory, help ease some pressure for Hertz, as a sale of its used-car fleet would shore up some cash concerns and could fetch about $3 billion, the analysts said. ""Given what appears to be robust demand for inventory in a rapidly recovering used retail market, we see ~150k HTZ cars as an attractive option for retailers such as AN and KMX with strategic focus on expanding used volumes,"" Mazari said. ""The most logical step would be to buy the fleet of cars which are available at a good price and shape … that's where the value lies,"" the Jefferies used car salesman noted, adding that the sale of cars - taking place at rather overinflated values - would help HTZ pay its lenders but also shore up some cash.",KMX,en,Zero Hedge

Do you look for a color that reflects your personality? Maybe you want a color that says, “Look at me!” Perhaps you like a certain color for your commuter car and another for your weekend pickup. Would you rather blend in with the crowd or stand out in a crowded parking lot? No matter what your motivation is, when it comes to choosing the best color for your next car, you have a rainbow of options. Interestingly, the most popular colors aren’t associated with a typical rainbow. No offense to red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, or violet, but most car buyers prefer neutral car colors, according to our data. In fact, if you’re looking for the best-selling colors, the answer is right here in black and white. *** We found that nearly half of cars sold at CarMax nationwide from December 1, 2017, through November 30, 2018, were black or white.

2019-01-03 10:35:32-05:00,Morgan Stanley Predicts First Global Auto Sales Volume Drop Since 2009,"Morgan Stanley's auto analyst Adam Jonas - formerly one of the biggest Tesla cheerleaders - predicts that global auto sales will be down 0.3% year over year in 2019 and that many consensus estimates across the industry are far too optimistic. In a note released Thursday morning, Jonas predicts ""lower guidance"" coming out of Detroit automakers at the same time that the global auto market sees its first volume drop since 2009. And despite consensus forecasts predicting revenue and margin growth across the board, Morgan Stanley generally defied the trend, reiterating its cautious view on the US auto sector. Jonas expects global volume in 2019 to fall to 82.1 million units versus 82.4 million units in 2018 . His team also expects higher input costs, combined with rising rates and rising R&D expense, to further pressure 2019 numbers. Aside from the obvious (lack of volume growth), he predicts tariff related costs will still be an overhang for automakers heading into the new year. Morgan Stanley also believes that industry consensus for 2019 earnings is too bullish.",KMX,en,Zero Hedge
