2020-07-27 16:41:22-05:00,Robinhood's Topsy-Turvy Top 10 Shipping Stocks,"Retail stock traders have taken center stage this year, embracing speculative bets that institutional investors have shunned. How does this trend affect ocean shipping equities? One indicator is stocks owned by customers of the highly popular Robinhood platform. Robinhood discloses how many of its users own each stock at any given time. This data is downloaded daily and measured over time by Robintrack.net. FreightWaves sifted through the Robintrack database and the Robinhood disclosures and picked out the leading shipping equities. The result is a very, very different Top 10 list than you'd get from institutional investors. #10 — Scorpio Tankers The Robinhood lineup starts out on normal footing with Scorpio Tankers Inc. (NYSE: STNG ). Scorpio is the largest public product-tanker owner. It attracts significant institutional investor interest and garners ""buy"" recommendations from several sell-side analysts. Scorpio Tankers stock was owned by 5,849 Robinhood users as of Monday. (The data does not show the total number of shares owned, just the number of owners.) (All charts courtesy of Robintrack.net ) Robinhood buyers piled into these shares starting in the second half of April.",GLOG,en,Benzinga

2019-11-27 09:19:00-05:00,Shipping's Spot-Rate Model Could Collide With Green Agenda,"The past two months have offered a textbook example of just how much stock investors crave the volatility of ocean shipping spot markets. Spot rates for very large crude carriers (VLCCs, tankers designed to carry 2 million barrels of crude oil) skyrocketed from $50,000 per day at the end of September to around $200,000 per day on Oct. 11, dropped back to $60,000 by mid-November and have now popped back above $100,000 per day. It's hard to find other markets to bet on that gyrate to this extreme. Tanker stocks with exposure to these spot rates have surged in response. This deep-seated focus on spot rates — not just among public and private investors but also among commodity charterers — could complicate plans to reduce the shipping industry's carbon footprint in the years ahead, a move that will almost certainly require much more time-charter coverage. Penalizing Period Charters Investors react negatively when ship owners do not have enough exposure to soaring spot rates. Case in point: the stock of Tsakos Energy Navigation or TEN (NYSE: TNP ), one of the largest tanker owners in the public market, which has lagged its compatriots, not just because it focuses on smaller vessel classes, but also because of its higher time-charter coverage.",GLOG,en,Benzinga Feeds
