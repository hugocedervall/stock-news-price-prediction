2020-11-13 08:24:00-05:00,Loans under deferral at the biggest US banks more than halved in Q3,"Summary List Placement Loans under deferral at the biggest four US banks plunged from $190 billion in June to $90 billion as of September 30, but it is uncertain whether they will continue declining in the coming months, according to Financial Times analysis of regulatory filings. The Q3 decline owes to consumers and businesses resuming payments as the economy began to reopen and social distancing measures eased in many regions. But spiking coronavirus infection rates across the US have raised concerns that the dip in deferrals could only be temporary. US banks pulled back on loan loss provisions across the board in Q3, suggesting confidence in customers' improving financial situations—but gauging the level of risk they face remains a challenge. Bank of America (BofA), Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and JPMorgan Chase have taken more than $62 billion in charges in total for future loan losses this year, largely in the first two quarters, per the FT. They tapered back their allocations in Q3, as more customers exited deferral programs and resumed regular payments: BofA, for example, set aside $1.39 billion for loan losses in Q3, far lower than the $5.12 billion it allocated in Q2.",WFC,en,Business Insider

All that changed today when the Basel-based Financial Stability Board released its latest annual rankings of systematically important banks , which saw JPMorgan drop one notch, from the 4th bucket where it had been since 2017 and which carried a 2.5% additional capital buffer, to the 3rd bucket, which JPMorgan will shares with Citigroup and HSBC.

The firms’ execs explain what’s at stake.,"Summary List Placement The relationship between banks and fintechs is complicated. Once seen as scrappy disruptors, fintechs have established themselves as a serious threat. For a majority of Americans, these consumer apps have become a key part of their financial lives. From peer-to-peer transfers to new forms of credit and no-fee bank accounts, fintechs run the gamut of personal-finance products. But the startup revolution hasn't occurred entirely independently. Fintechs still need banks, or at the very least, the data stored inside them. With many of their customers maintaining accounts at traditional financial firms, fintechs need to be able to connect and share information with their much larger peers. That's where companies like Plaid and Envestnet's Yodlee come in. These data aggregators sit in the middle, connecting third-party apps to various banks' systems. But in recent years banks have raised questions about the efficacy of these data aggregators, challenging their security practices or pushing to deny their access altogether .",WFC,en,Business Insider

2020-10-30 14:32:00-05:00,The 6 best credit cards for bad credit in November 2020,"Summary List Placement Having a low credit score makes it harder to get approved for a new credit card and other types of loans, and it means that when you do get approved for, say, a mortgage, you'll generally get less-favorable terms like the highest variable interest rates. A bad credit score is defined as anything below 580, according to the FICO scoring model, and anything below 601 according to VantageScore. If you currently find yourself in this credit score range, you probably won't get approved for popular rewards cards like the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card , but you do have some credit card options. Secured credit cards are particularly easy to get approved for, because you put up a cash deposit as collateral to get started, and there are also non-secured cards tailored to those looking to repair or build their credit. Using a card responsibly will help boost your credit over time, since keeping your credit utilization low and making on-time payments are the two biggest factors that determine your credit score .",WFC,en,Business Insider

The bank's chief US equity strategist and chief investment officer said in a Monday note that he expects the market to drop another 10% in the near term as investors face uncertainty around the election outcome, more fiscal stimulus, and another wave of COVID-19. But once the dust settles, Wilson said he expects the bull market to ensue — one which will be led by cyclical and smaller-cap stocks as earnings get a boost from the economic recovery. As such, Wilson recommended using a near term sell-off as a buying opportunity. ""We think the best opportunities lie in stocks where earnings are growing with the cyclical rebound and growing by enough to offset any valuation headwinds,"" Wilson said. He continued: ""On any pullbacks, we would look to our earnings upside screen from September — 66% of stocks have outperformed the market with median outperformance of 2.",WFC,en,Business Insider

After his father suffered a heart attack in 2017, Cohen made a series of tough calls to spend more time with him: scrapping plans to take Chewy public, selling the company for $3.4 billion, and resigning as CEO the following year. Cohen broke with convention again by investing the vast majority of his wealth in two stocks , Apple and Wells Fargo, and later placing a contrarian bet on ailing video-game retailer GameStop. The entrepreneur attributes his independent streak to the ""two biggest influences on my professional life"": his father, Ted Cohen, who passed away last December, and Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO. ""Something critical that I learned from my dad and Warren Buffett was the ability to separate myself from the herd and think independently,"" Cohen told Business Insider this week. The pair's teachings allow him to ""block out the noise, develop my own point of view, and not be influenced by daily headlines or the consensus or what's in style."" For example, many people initially doubted Chewy would be able to ship 30-pound bags of pet food to customers and make any money.

Automated mortgage underwriting is the process where advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technology electronically undertakes the decision making process for granting mortgage loans.

Shareholders in publicly traded companies have the right to vote on certain corporate matters.

In this article I explain why the purchasing power of the dollar is hostage to foreign sellers, and that if the Fed continues with current monetary policies the dollar will follow the same fate as John Law’s livre in 1720 . As always in these situations, there is little public understanding of money and the realisation that monetary policy is designed to tax people for the benefit of their government will come as an unpleasant shock.

Specifically, we focused on five deals marketed at the start of the month to fund shareholder dividends, which accounting for half of the week’s volume, and the most in a week since 2017, according to Bloomberg. Now, a little over a week late, the FT is also looking at these dividend recap deals which have become all the rage in the loan market in recent weeks, among other reasons because they are ""ringing alarm bells since they come on top of already high leverage and weak investor protections and against a backdrop of economic uncertainty.""

JPMorgan Chase operates about 5,000 physical branches across the US, and Bank of America has roughly 4,300.

But from April through June, many of the biggest law firms were comfortably above those thresholds, with attorneys specializing in employment advice, bankruptcy and other in-demand practices kicking into high gear as dealmaking slowed down. Still, law firms aren't out of the woods yet, with some fearing that a struggling economy could dog them for months. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . The biggest law firms in the US planned for the worst when the pandemic hit. Retreats were cancelled, salaries were slashed, profit distributions were delayed and staff were furloughed at some of the highest-grossing firms. Leaders drew up plans for 20%, even 50% drops in business. For the most part, though, that hasn't happened. Recent interviews and surveys suggest that a typical Big Law firm saw revenue drops in the single percentage points, with Wells Fargo saying demand — hours worked, in industry jargon — fell just 1.4% in the first five months of the year.",WFC,en,Business Insider
2020-08-03 07:00:00-05:00,US Banking Digital Trust Study: Which US banks have the highest levels of digital trust among consumers,"This is a preview of Business Insider Intelligence's US Banking Digital Trust Report 2020 . The full report will be available to Business Insider Intelligence enterprise clients in late April. To learn more about this report, email Business Insider Intelligence Client Services at bii-clientservices@businessinsider.com . The US banks with the highest levels of digital trust in 2020 are PNC, Chase, and Citibank, according to Business Insider Intelligence's inaugural Banking Digital Trust study. Digital trust is the confidence that consumers place in their banks' digital channels — and that confidence is more important now than ever. As the coronavirus pandemic sparks branch closures , digital banking outages , and fraud schemes , trust is being put to the test on multiple levels. Building digital trust could unlock valuable benefits for banks, including increased satisfaction, engagement, and customer lifetime value. Respondents who rated their bank above average in digital trust ratings considered themselves likely to open their next account at the bank at more than twice the rate of those with low trust (22.6% versus 10.4%).",WFC,en,Business Insider

Now, two months after we first revealed Wall Street's worst kept secret, the Financial Times has also noticed that Corporate America is finding it hard to kick the share buyback habit, even after the US slipped into its worst recession in decades. While total buybacks are indeed expected to drop this year as the downturn caused by coronavirus saps corporate profits, companies in the S&P 500 that have reported second-quarter earnings so far have reduced the number of their outstanding shares by an average of 0.3 per cent from the previous quarter, according to calculations from Credit Suisse.",WFC,en,Zero Hedge

Para el Gobierno de Donald Trump, sin embargo, la red social de moda en EE.UU. no es ninguna broma. La considera desde hace meses una amenaza a la seguridad nacional y este fin de semana el presidente de EE.UU. dio el paso de anunciar su veto. La clave del peligro de TikTok: es una empresa china, una filial de ByteDance, con sede en Pekín. «En lo que respecta a TikTok, los vamos a vetar en EE.UU.», dijo el viernes Trump a los periodistas que le acompañan en el avión presidencial, el Air Force One. Estaba previsto que Trump hiciera ayer un anuncio al respecto. Una de las opciones para cumplir su amenaza es una orden ejecutiva que expulse a la red social de EE.UU., donde tiene cerca de 80 millones de usuarios.

Wolfe Research analyst Jeff Kvaal wrote in a note Friday (seen by Barrons ) that Apple's current valuation was perplexing: ""Few firms shape their industry as has Apple; fewer shape society,"" Kvaal wrote. ""We challenge neither premise. We do, however, ponder the stock's sharp multiple expansion . Possible rationales—a 5G supercycle, mix shift to services, re-rating to a consumer staples multiple—all seem thin."" With shares up 75% since the March low, Kvaal warns Apple's fundamentals ""can't support the move.""

Adding that, ""US operator data from the 4G cycle indicates a lengthening replacement cycle ,"" he wrote. ""Phone sales decelerated sharply during the 2008 recession.",WFC,en,Zero Hedge

In a Thursday coronavirus briefing, President Donald Trump said the pact ""means less to me now than it did when I made it"" as he continues to lay blame on China for the COVID-19 breakout. That, as well as China's demand that the U.S. close its Chengdu consulate – a retaliatory measure for a similar American order earlier this week – helped crack investor confidence. 14 Stocks to Sell or Stay Away From Senate Republicans' fiscal stimulus proposal was delayed again, too, with a reveal now expected on Monday. Intel was a particular drag following its Thursday evening earnings report, when it admitted that its next-generation CPUs will be released six months later than expected. ""We believe the company’s delay of its 7nm roadmap will foster fears of competitive pressures persisting, if not accelerating over the next 2-3 years and thereby cap the valuation on its shares,"" wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore, who downgraded the stock from Buy to Hold. ""While INTC has successfully proven that it can generate solid revenue and earnings growth despite being behind on Moore’s Law (a trend that likely persists into 2021), we believe fears of the announced 6-month 7nm delay extending to a 10nm-esque multi-year issue that eventually does impact fundamentals will likely keep INTC's shares range-bound until the company definitively proves otherwise.""

About 20 years ago, Tony Julianelle lost money on his first property investment. He was in his early twenties and living in his home state of Nebraska, where he bought six units in a small town with a population of about 6,000 people. He told Business Insider that he lost money on all of them. For Julianelle, the lesson for him was that, while he could probably end up generating passive income from renting to such a small town in the long run, it would probably take him 30 years to do it. And the returns wouldn't compare to what he could make elsewhere. ""A good market can even fix stupid,"" he said, ""but if you're going to invest in a town of 6,000 people, you should probably live there for the rest of your life."" Now, after a 20-year career in management at Wells Fargo, where he headed up mortgage lending for seven Midwestern states, Julianelle is the CEO of Colorado-based property management firm Atlas Real Estate, and has developed a personal real estate portfolio worth around $3.5 million, a valuation he plans to grow with yearly acquisitions.",WFC,en,Business Insider

Specifically, the bank reported total Q2 revenue of $22.3BN, slightly better than the $22.01BN expected but down 3.3% Y/Y. This resulted in Net Income of $3.5BN, down 52% Y/Y, and EPS of $0.37, down exactly half from the $0.74 a year ago. Looking closer at revenue, Net Interest Income tumbled to $10.8BN, missing the $11.1BN expectation and down 11% from $12.3BN a year ago, driven by lower interest rates, partially offset by loan and deposit growth (YoY spot 1M LIBOR fell 222 bps; 10yr treasury rate declined 135 bps). The bank was hit especially hard by the plunge in the net interest yield which slumped to an all time low of 1.87%, a record 46 bps drop from 2.33 in Q1.",WFC,en,Zero Hedge

2020-07-15 22:19:48-05:00,TikTok’s data harvesting prompts security concerns,"By Shelly Banjo, Kartikay Mehrotra and William TurtonTikTok has become one of the world’s most popular apps by serving up a steady beat of lip-syncing videos and viral memes. But behind the scenes the company, owned by one of China’s biggest tech firms, is also scooping up massive amounts of data on Americans and tracking users’ every move.Security researchers say TikTok’s information-collection practices are consistent with Facebook Inc., Google and other U.S. tech companies looking to tailor ads and services to their users. The bigger issue lies in what TikTok does with the intel it gathers. Some groups, like the Democratic and Republican national committees and Wells Fargo & Co., have discouraged or banned people from using the app.“The problem here is not the quantity of data that’s being collected, but rather who else can access it. And those problems exist on the end of data transmission that no one but TikTok can see,” said Oded Vanunu, head of products vulnerability research at Check Point Software Technologies Ltd., who discovered a security hole in the app last year that has since been resolved.There’s little doubt the backlash against TikTok stems in part from the ongoing economic and political rivalry between Washington and Beijing.",WFC,en,Economic Times India

Brooks noted that the existing rules that govern branch closures will remain in place, and warned that banks won't see extensions on waivers they've received during the pandemic. For context, banks must give the OCC 90 days' notice before shutting branches, including a detailed reasoning behind their decision.

Despite the mortgage space representing the largest US lending market — with debt sitting at $9.2 trillion — it's been the slowest to digitize, and incumbents have had little incentive to remove friction from the customer application process. The customer experience has been hampered by a time-consuming process that requires spending hours filling out an application and gathering documents, a lack of transparency about the status of the process, and uncertainty about what outstanding documentation could be requested later. And with no viable challengers to the status quo, incumbent lenders had little reason to overhaul this process. But Quicken Loans turned the mortgage industry on its head with the introduction of Rocket Mortgage, an online mortgage application that takes less than 10 minutes to complete, in November 2015.",WFC,en,Business Insider

2020-05-21 10:36:00-05:00,The 6 best credit cards for bad credit in May 2020,"Having a low credit score makes it harder to get approved for a new credit card and other types of loans, and it means that when you do get approved for, say, a mortgage, you'll generally get less-favorable terms like the highest variable interest rates. A bad credit score is defined as anything below 580, according to the FICO scoring model, and anything below 601 according to VantageScore. If you currently find yourself in this credit score range, you probably won't get approved for popular rewards cards like the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card , but you do have some credit card options. Secured credit cards are particularly easy to get approved for, because you put up a cash deposit as collateral to get started, and there are also non-secured cards tailored to those looking to repair or build their credit. Using a card responsibly will help boost your credit over time, since keeping your credit utilization low and making on-time payments are the two biggest factors that determine your credit score .",WFC,en,Business Insider

For the past two years, crypto-media outlets and Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocates have placed heavy emphasis on the need for institutional investors to embrace the cryptocurrency sector. The oft-stated belief was that institutional inflow would lead to mass adoption and an incredible spike in the value of crypto-assets as a whole. Fast forward to the present, and the total cryptocurrency market capitalization has yet to reach the $750 billion all-time high seen in late 2017. The slow recovery of crypto prices raises a few hard to answer questions. If institutional funds have been flowing into cryptocurrencies, why hasn’t there been a significant price increase over the last three years?

In an environment of fear, financial institutions become a lot tighter with their money, and that inevitably causes economic activity to slow down. For example, just consider what happened in 2008. Mortgage lending standards suddenly became much more strict, and that greatly contributed to the horrific housing price crash which left millions upon millions of Americans underwater on their mortgages. Unfortunately, this coronavirus pandemic has created a wave of fear that is far greater than what we experienced during the last recession, and that has enormous implications for the months ahead.

Amid falling interest rates, mortgage volumes have been soaring since the second half of 2019. That went into overdrive this week after the Federal Reserve announced a surprise, emergency cut to its benchmark interest rate in the face of the growing global coronavirus outbreak. Following the rate cut, JPMorgan Chase's call centers and digital channels were flooded with mortgage-related inquiries, leading the bank this week to dial back its marketing spend. In contrast, Bank of America isn't shifting home-equity staff — because it extensively trained hundreds of them on mortgage underwriting in 2019 to give the bank more flexibility. Experts say rates heightened demand will continue as rates fall further, and that could mean long wait times to close on homes and refinancings. Visit BI Prime for more stories .

2020-02-27 10:11:55-05:00,Billionaire Ken Griffin Pulls the Trigger on These 3 “Strong Buy” Stocks,"While the economy is booming, there are some warnings signs starting to flash. Hedge fund manager Ken Griffin – who started trading at age 19, and now at 51 has amassed a fortune worth $15 billion – spoke about some of the near- and long-term risks in a recent interview. Griffin sees inflation as a danger in the longer term, mostly because the financial experts lack tools to determine when inflationary trends are starting. Griffin recounts how his firm’s best analysts were caught flat-footed in 2018 when the Fed started raising rates. Regarding the lack of accurate predictive foresight, Griffin says, “If there were inflation, the markets are utterly and completely unprepared for that.” But inflation, being invisible for now, is a long-term worry. Griffin sees the coronavirus outbreak has a larger threat, at least for the present.

The deadly coronavirus outbreak in China brought back memories of the economic repercussions from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in the early 2000s, which hit the major financial center of Hong Kong hard. Stock market sentiment also appears to have taken a dent after the International Monetary Fund reduced its forecast for 2020 global economic growth to 3.3% from the 3.4% it had previously projected. Still, the new figure would be an increase from an estimated 2.9% growth in 2019. It also seems that President Trump’s impeachment trial may be adding a layer of caution to the market. But overall, traders and investors don’t seem too worried about it. Even though the market could be set for a pullback today, that might not be a bad thing.

At 4:06 p.m. (2106 GMT), the Canadian dollar was trading 0.3% lower at 1.3005 to the greenback, or 76.89 U.S. cents. The currency hit its weakest intraday level since New Year's Eve at 1.3029. The price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, surrendered some recent gains as investors reconsidered the likelihood of immediate supply disruptions in the Middle East after the United States killed a top Iranian military commander last week. U.S. crude oil futures settled 0.9% lower at $62.70 a barrel. The pullback in oil prices weighed on the loonie after the currency had ""a pretty overextended move"" in recent days, said Erik Nelson, a currency strategist at Wells Fargo. Last Tuesday, the Canadian dollar notched a 14-month high at 1.2947. The decline for the loonie on Tuesday came as official data showed that Canada's exports and imports both declined in November and as separate data showed that purchasing managers were less active in December. .",WFC,en,Reuters

2019-12-24 10:25:06-05:00,Achieving Real-Time Gross Settlement With On Chain Integrity,"Since the dawn of the 20th century, evolutions in communications technology have resulted in our financial systems becoming increasingly interconnected and interdependent. Early attempts at electronic fund transfers still relied on net settlement systems: Banks aggregated their balances with one another before settling up at the end of each business day. If, for example, Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC ) transferred $10 million to Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC ), and Wells Fargo sent $10 million to HSBC (NYSE: HSBC ), these amounts would be aggregated and the ledger would only reflect the money travelling from Bank of America to HSBC, without any information as to the intermediate step. As the volume of economic activity grew, it became imperative to design a financial messaging protocol that would facilitate the transfer of money or securities in real-time. So financial institutions, central banks and government agencies came together to build real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS) capable of clearing and settling payments between banks on a per-transaction basis.",WFC,en,Benzinga Feeds

2019-04-18 16:15:00-05:00,The best cash-back credit cards of 2019,"Business Insider may receive a commission from The Points Guy Affiliate Network if you apply for a credit card, but our reporting and recommendations are always independent and objective. Cash-back cards are the most popular rewards credit cards, according to a recent study. While it's possible to get more value from travel rewards cards , cash back is simpler, more flexible, and often easier. Like most rewards credit cards , cash-back cards work by giving you a portion of the processing fee that the issuer gets from the merchant for each transaction. While some cards offer a consistent 1.5–2% cash-back rate on purchases, you may be better off with a card that offers higher amounts back in bonus categories, or large new membership bonuses. Similarly, you might actually earn more from a card with an annual fee than a no-annual-fee option. These are the best cash back credit cards currently available, from Chase, Citi, Wells Fargo, Capital One, and American Express. When you're looking to earn credit card rewards, the type of rewards you go for, beyond just the specific card you open, can make a big difference in how much value you get.",WFC,en,Business Insider
2019-04-18 11:34:52-05:00,"Constellation Brands warrants in Canopy Growth changed by deal--but it's still a positive, analyst says","Constellation Brands Inc. shares rallied Thursday, after Canadian cannabis company Canopy Growth Corp. announced a deal that will give it the rights to acquire U.S. multistate operator Acreage Holdings Inc. as soon as the U.S. federal ban on cannabis has been lifted. The deal brings changes to the terms of Constellation's warrants in Canopy, in which it has invested $4 billion, according to Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog. As part of that deal announced last August, Constellation Brands gained 38% ownership and received warrants that if exercised would raise that stake to above 50%. Herzog wrote in a note to clients that there are four key impacts from the modification of the warrants, three of which are positive and one slightly negative. On the positive side, the deal extends the exercise period for Constellation to five to eight years from three years previously, ""suggesting less 'cash out the door',"" for the Corona beer distributor. Also positive, the deal does not change Constellation's representation on the Canopy board in the form of four directors.",WFC,en,MarketWatch

2019-03-28 13:36:38-05:00,US: The long slide in home sales Appears to have ended - Wells Fargo,"Data from the US showed that pending home sales fell 1.0% in February after a 4.3% gain in the previous months. Analysts at Wells Fargo point out that while the return of winter weather accounts for much of the pullback, pending sales rose solidly in the South and West. Key Quotes: “Given the long slide in home sales during most of 2018 and the sharp drop in sales late last year, the first two months of 2019 have marked a bit of a respite.” “The Fed’s more dovish tone on interest rates has likely arrested the slide in home sales but has not yet engendered a recovery. The improvement in pending home sales has been confirmed by some modest improvement in mortgage purchase applications.” “After surging 8.9% in January, pending sales rose 1.7% in the South, which accounts for the bulk of home sales. Pending sales also inched up 0.5% in the West, marking the fourth consecutive gain. Sales remain down year-over-year in all regions, however.”",WFC,en,FXStreet

According to analysts at Wells Fargo, the revised numbers signals the US economy continued to create income at a solid pace. They expect corporate profit growth to slow meaningfully going forward. Key Quotes: “The broad weakness in the retail environment at the end of last year caused consumer spending to increase only 2.5%, down from the initial 2.8% estimate, with the weakness concentrated in goods consumption. Fixed investment also saw smaller increases than initially reported in both the nonresidential and residential omponents of spending. But, a smaller increase in imports resulted in a more modest drag from net exports than previously reported.” “Today’s GDP release continues to show that the rate of economic growth in the United States has downshifted a bit over the past few quarters. Our current forecast looks for further deceleration in the first quarter, but we then look for a modest rebound starting in Q2.” “The data also included the first look at economy-wide corporate profits in the fourth quarter.",WFC,en,FXStreet

Key Quotes: “The red ink in the nation’s current account rose from $126.6 billion in Q3-2018 to $134.4 billion in the fourth quarter, the largest deficit in ten years.” “When measured as a percent of GDP, however, the current account deficit today (2-½%) is much smaller than it was ten years ago, when it exceeded 5%. Large current account deficits can make an economy vulnerable to the destabilizing effects of sudden outflows of foreign capital.” “U.S. companies continue to repatriate earnings from their foreign subsidiaries, which reflects changes to the corporate tax code that went into effect at the end of 2017.” “Foreign companies continue to find the United States an attractive investment location.",WFC,en,FXStreet

According to them unexpected move will lift tracking estimates for Q1 GDP, but the imports collapse is worrisome for domestic demand. Key Quotes : “The trade gap narrowed by a substantial $8.8 billion in January. To keep that in perspective, it’s useful to consider that in the prior month the trade deficit was as large as it has been at any point since the height of the financial crisis in 2008. Indeed, even after the improvement here in January, the deficit remains larger than it was at any point between 2009 and 2016.” “Exports increased $1.9 billion, retracing a little less than half of the $4 billion drop in December. Most of the gain came on the goods side. The biggest major category increase was food and beverage exports, which shot up 13.1% in January. Within that category, the big mover was once again soybeans.” “Tempting though it may be to conclude that this is a China effect, we cannot be sure.",WFC,en,FXStreet

Key Quotes: “Consumers’ confidence continued to moderate in March, with the consumer confidence index falling 7.3 points to 124.1. That puts the index 13.8 points below where it was in October—before confidence was shaken in the final two months of last year.” “The stock market selloff late last year likely played a role, and though equities have retraced some lost ground, the market related dent to confidence has yet to be fully restored.” “Confidence is also a reflection of the labor market—which remains supportive of sentiment—but is starting to show some cracks in the foundation.”",WFC,en,FXStreet

They point out all of the swing was in single-family starts, which are more susceptible to swings in the weather. Key Quotes: “The decline was almost entirely due to swings in the weather. Single-family starts had surged 19.2% in January. That month saw unseasonably mild weather across much of the country, where construction had been previously held back by incessant rains and natural disasters.” “Multifamily starts are less impacted by the weather, and starts rebounded 17.8% in February following declines of 7.1% in January and 18.1% in December. Multifamily starts are notoriously volatile on a monthly basis and the latest swings are somewhat typical of what happens around year-end.” “Permits are less influenced by the weather and provide a better indication of where the housing market is headed this spring. Overall permits fell 1.6% in February, with all of the drop occurring in multifamily units.",WFC,en,FXStreet

Key Quotes: “Fears of a Eurozone recession are back in the headlines today after a series of disappointing PMI figures from the currency bloc. The March manufacturing PMI declined more than expected to 47.6, the lowest level since 2013.” “The continued decline in the manufacturing PMI in the first three months of 2019 suggest the weakness in the hard data for the sector probably persisted in the first quarter.

2019-03-22 13:27:20-05:00,US: Sales of existing homes ramped up in February - Wells Fargo,"Data released today showed a rebound in sales of existing home sales in February. Analysts at Wells Fargo point out sales benefited from better weather early this year and lower mortgage rates. Key Quotes: “After declining for much of last year, existing home sales were poised for rebound. Pending home sales, which reflect purchase contracts, had jumped 4.6% in January, which meant that sales, which reflect closings, would likely rise in February.” “Seasonal adjustment likely exaggerated the extent of the improvement. The 5.51 million-unit pace is 1.8% below the year ago pace, which was also the cyclical peak. Benefitted “Existing home inventories continue to trend higher and are 3.2% above their year-ago level. Homes are remaining on the market longer than a year ago, which has moderated price appreciation.”",WFC,en,FXStreet

According to analysts at Wells Fargo, the Federal Reserve now thinks that it will not need to tighten any further this year. Key Quotes: “Today’s announcement was not without consequence.

In December, the median FOMC forecaster projected 50 bps of tightening in 2019 and another 25 bps rate hike in 2020.

They also noted that the pause on deliveries also represents a near-term risk to equipment spending. Key Quotes: “Whether from the Defense Department or from private airlines, aircraft orders are usually a big swing factor in overall durable goods orders."" “The groundings apply only to the 737-MAX, the most recent generation of the world’s best-selling aircraft. Since the first shipment in May 2017, Boeing has delivered just 376 of the aircraft in question, though the total number of orders booked is just over 5,000, the earliest of which were recorded as far back as 2011. If some of those orders were to be canceled, the Commerce Department would subtract them from the headline figure in the month in which they occur for the durable goods report, according to notes in the report release and our discussions with Commerce Department staff.” “Considering the 737-MAX aircraft comprises almost half of Boeing’s orders in the past few years the total negative impact to durables could be substantial if airlines hold off on new 737-MAX orders the next few months.” “Orders still came in during the grounding period and the Dreamliner has subsequently seen steady sales volume.",WFC,en,FXStreet

Other major economies in Europe, North America and Asia registered only marginally positive growth late last year, while China’s economy extended its ongoing gradual and orderly economic slowdown.” “Against this backdrop of slower international growth, many foreign central banks have adopted a more dovish stance. Most notably the European Central Bank (ECB) has signaled that policy rates may now be on hold through all of 2019, and also announced a new round of targeted long-term loans. The Bank of Canada (BoC) said that the timing of future rate hikes had become more uncertain, while central banks in Australia and New Zealand have explicitly acknowledged in recent months that the next move in policy interest rates could be up or down.” “Even with slower growth, our forecast for calendar 2019 anticipates that many major economies will grow close to (or above) their potential or trend growth rates.",WFC,en,FXStreet

2019-02-21 15:22:11-05:00,"The Last Time This Divergence Emerged, Was Just Before The 2008 Crash","We discussed the collapse in the VIX earlier , when we pointed out that at least according to the world's largest bond manager, this artificial market calm foreshadows another surge in volatility just around the corner, which is also why Pimco's CIO had one recommendation: start selling now. However, while Pimco may be accused of merely talking their book, there is another empirical indicator which suggests that a violent market reversal may be imminent. According to Wells Fargo’s recession model, which similarly to JPMorgan's and Goldman's uses various market signals such as the 3M10Y treasury spread and various economic inputs, the chances of a recession in the US over the next 12 months spiked in December and hit 40% in January (while high, this is still well below JPMorgan's 60% odds of a recession in the next coming year ). However, as Wells Fargo's in house derivative strategist Pravit Chintawongvanich observes, this surge in the probability of a recession is at odds with the implied one-year equity volatility which as discussed earlier, is now trending below its 2018 average. ""Despite the increased recession probability, long-dated equity volatility is actually trading lower than in previous years,’’ Chintawongvanich wrote in a client note, adding that the vol collapse likely reflects market structure issues (i.e., various speculators selling vol both directly and indirectly) rather than outright complacency.",WFC,en,Zero Hedge

Forward guidance, for one, recognized the effects of markets. If QE was really effective, interest rates would rise not fall in anticipation of those positive effects. This was, actually, the whole thing behind 2013’s “taper tantrum.” Ben Bernanke came up with a contrary scheme the year before when announcing QE3 hoping to head them off. He anticipated that his form of “forward guidance” would prove decisive; that is, the Fed’s Chairman promised QE3 would be “open ended” and therefore the central bank would keep on buying MBS (technically TBA) no matter. The idea was that markets would be more enthralled by the purchases than their expected success; rising rates betting on the latter being held in check by lower rates due to the Fed’s persisting bid. More than that, Economists had further expected that this “easing” would kickstart a strangely lethargic economic system.",WFC,en,Zero Hedge
