The bank's chief US equity strategist and chief investment officer said in a Monday note that he expects the market to drop another 10% in the near term as investors face uncertainty around the election outcome, more fiscal stimulus, and another wave of COVID-19. But once the dust settles, Wilson said he expects the bull market to ensue — one which will be led by cyclical and smaller-cap stocks as earnings get a boost from the economic recovery. As such, Wilson recommended using a near term sell-off as a buying opportunity. ""We think the best opportunities lie in stocks where earnings are growing with the cyclical rebound and growing by enough to offset any valuation headwinds,"" Wilson said. He continued: ""On any pullbacks, we would look to our earnings upside screen from September — 66% of stocks have outperformed the market with median outperformance of 2.",KWR,en,Business Insider
