2020-12-03 13:44:31-05:00,Top execs rush to settle insider trading cases under Sebi scheme,"Mumbai: Top officials of listed companies facing the glare of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for alleged insider trading violations are getting a reprieve thanks to the regulator’s new settlement scheme. In the last few months, Sebi has settled at least half-a-dozen insider trading cases through the consent route, through which an accused can settle any ongoing case with Sebi by paying up without accepting or denying guilt.Some senior employees of companies such as Diageo, Titan, Divi’s Laboratories, NIIT and JM Financial have settled their insider trading cases via this mechanism, data showed.Until last year, serious market offences like insider trading or front running were not allowed to be settled under the consent mechanism. However, in 2019 Sebi tweaked the rules to allow even such serious violations to be settled.“The scheme ensures that the regulator concentrates on larger, systemic issues having a market-wide impact while at the same time providing an alternate mechanism for dealing with minor violations of securities law,” said Anil Choudhary, partner, Finsec Law Advisors. “Under the new norms, Sebi has also increased the settlement fees which ensures that there is sufficient deterrent for market participants from violating securities laws.”The accused who opts for a settlement with Sebi will have to cough up four to five times the fine he would have to pay in a regular adjudication process.",DEO,en,Economic Times India

However, in a new research note, Deutsche Bank believes there is a long-term trend toward localization and smaller companies will be better positioned to benefit from this shift. ""Covid-19 has turbocharged the deglobalization movement, as supply chains have been upended, geopolitical risk has risen, and ESG-conscious customers and investors have pushed companies to be more 'resilient' and local,"" Deutsche Bank equity analyst, Luke Templeman said in the October 19 note. A localization business strategy is one where a product, or business model is adapted for a specific country, adjusting for cultural, political and legal differences. Business localization is a trend that has been under discussion for some time.

Downturns in stocks are normal, although the speed of this one was unusual, and nothing about recent circumstances has been normal anyway. Andrew Slimmon, a senior portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management who advises on the firm's long-equity strategies, says there's good news for investors who've been shaken up by the events of early September: The slump isn't a sign of impending disaster. ""The tech stocks and growth stocks are oversold,"" Slimmon told Business Insider in an exclusive interview. ""I don't see the big mega-cap tech stocks as outrageously expensive.

Media planners and advertisers do not expect the recent political controversy around the WSJ report to contribute to a dent in ad spends on Facebook. Political issues and battles are unlikely to hamper advertising sentiments in India compared to the US and Facebook’s large SME base continues to advertise heavily on the platform, they said. Google and Facebook corner around 70% of India’s overall digital ad spends according to industry estimates. Facebook did not respond to an email seeking comments for this story.“Facebook with its approximately 280 million users, enjoys a great reach in the Indian digital ecosystem.

We asked Gunn — who has 19 years' experience in the industry — what mistakes people are making when they drink whisky, and how to fix them. Buy based on flavour, not age ""When people buy a whisky, you do sometimes come across an obsession with age, when really, in my opinion, you should be buying based on the flavour,"" Gunn said.

Talwar, who’s been detained in a corruption case, had “lobbied” for Mallya and the two were “very close”, said one of persons. These messages include attempts to dissuade the Bihar government from implementing a liquor ban, expressions of concern over probable inclusion of Airbus in the Kingfisher loan scandal probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the release of a statement to the media after Mallya left for London in 2016, said the people cited above. The messages took the form of emails and SMSes between Mallya and Talwar as well as their associates, they said. Messages on the liquor ban in Bihar involved executives of United Spirits, then owned by Mallya, and Talwar’s company Deepak Talwar Associates (DTA). The correspondence, which ET has seen, was obtained by the CBI and income tax officials and has been put on the record in court by them to establish that Talwar lobbied for Mallya. 69226543 The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has charged Talwar, extradited from Dubai this year, with receiving kickbacks of Rs 272 crore while acting as a middleman to illegally secure favourable air traffic rights for foreign airlines in 2008-09 at the cost of national carrier Air India by liaising with several government functionaries.",DEO,en,The Economic Times India
