Google Cloud is partnering with over 20 companies to run over 200 edge computing applications using Google Cloud's network and its product Anthos, it announced Tuesday.

Starting in February, the first outbreaks of the coronavirus pandemic resulted in China shutting down, followed by other countries from March onward. Companies had to quickly pivot to enabling remote work where possible and crafting new work-from-home (WFH) policies, many of which will remain in effect into 2021 and beyond. Hackers have rapidly moved to target remote workers and adjusted their tactics to take advantage of the move to WFH. IT departments are reacting to the rapid move to WFH by adding network, virtual private networks (VPNs), and firewall capacity to keep up with user demand—but the road has been bumpy. These technologies have been around for years, and will still be in use for years to come, but they have many shortcomings in terms of cost and performance that will require the use of newer, cloud-based technologies.",PANW,en,Business Insider
