2020-05-15 07:32:00-05:00,The COVID-19 crisis has frozen a $6.4 billion market where venture fund investors could sell their partnership interests. That freeze could drive cash-strapped investors to another option — walking away from their funding commitments to VCs,"When a venture capital firm raises a new fund, the money committed by outside investors might seem to be set in stone for a period as long as 10 years. But those fund investors, called limited partners, can actually trade away their partnership stakes through private transactions. In recent years, a $6.4 billion secondary market has grown up to manage those trades, but it's now frozen due to the coronavirus-induced recession. In an uncertain economy, buyers and sellers find it hard to peg the value of venture fund stakes, so they're standing pat. That freeze could spell trouble for VC firms, because the secondary market was a safety valve for fund investors who found it hard to come up with the cash they had pledged to pitch in to the venture fund over time. If the original limited partners can't sell their partnership interests to another investor, they might simply back out of their financial commitments to the venture capital firm. The trading freeze will eventually lift, but when it does, experts predict that stakes in venture funds will sell at steeply discounted rates.",USAC,en,Business Insider
2020-05-11 07:22:51-05:00,The consequences of LP defaults due to capital calls,"The consequences of LP defaults due to capital calls Submitted 11/05/2020 - 1:22pm By Jeffrey M Bronheim, Daniel H Mathias, James R Mossetto, Cohen & Gresser – The current global Covid-19 pandemic continues to have a major impact on a wide variety of economic activities. For private equity funds, investor uncertainty and the need to preserve cash may drive LPs to question their obligations to fund capital calls. When subscribing to a private equity fund, an LP will usually commit to make a total capital commitment of a specified amount. This capital commitment is typically contributed to the fund over time, pursuant to drawdown notices or capital calls issued by the fund’s GP. Such notices or calls are most commonly made as investments for the fund are identified. An LP default occurs when an LP fails to fund such a drawdown notice. Historically, LP default cases appear to be relatively rare. This is not least because of the harsh consequences of a default in the typical private equity fund Limited Partnership Agreement, and the obvious reputational ramifications of an LP default on that LP’s acceptance as an investor into a private equity fund in the future.",USAC,en,PrivateEquityWire
