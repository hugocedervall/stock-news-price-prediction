Experts said a case of collective dominance might not stand in the absence of such a provision in the law.

In order to use Google’s Android OS on their smart TVs, manufacturers have to agree to a clause that restricts them from using any competing OS or forked versions of Android on smart TVs or any other devices they manufacture, including smartphones, according to the complaint.

However, large-scale consolidations often present unique market structures that may pose challenges to competition.In these scenarios, competition regulation assumes greater significance to preserve competition and protect consumer welfare. The Competition Commission of India (CCI) looks into M&As from the competition perspective. All M&As above a certain asset and turnover threshold are to be mandatorily notified to CCI for an ex ante assessment of an appreciable adverse effect on competition. CCI needs to look into the future structure of the market, and this cannot be based on crystal-gazing.The key to success of any merger review regime is to conduct a quick assessment so that firms can consummate their transactions and save time and costs on account for the necessary approvals. CCI considers the market dynamics that includes the level of concentration, degree of countervailing buyer power, the possibility of failing business, and contribution to the economic development.",CCI,en,Economic Times India

2020-06-02 01:43:15-05:00,The coming Facebook-Jio stress test for CCI,"By Vivek AgarwalWhen it comes to the power of big data, it would be difficult to disagree that Facebook may be called the old ‘Titan’ and Jio, the next generation data God (Zeus). It is a stretch to say that Facebook may have drawn guidance from Greek mythology while joining hands with Jio, but one wonders! Perhaps, there is no point in Titanomachy and it is smarter to conquer together.Following the announcement of Facebook’s $5.7 billion investment in Jio Platforms, the largest minority investment by a technology company worldwide, Reliance Jio confirmed that it would approach the Competition Commission of India (CCI) for its approval. It is reassuring to know that the CCI will scrutinise this mega deal between two data giants before it can be consummated, unlike Facebook’s earlier acquisition of WhatsApp which escaped the CCI’s scrutiny. However, the key question is whether the CCI is equipped to deal with big data issues and if it would, in fact, go beyond its comfort zone (traditional competition rules) to analyse the potential adverse impact of such a mega deal.It is no secret that the primary driver of this deal is the vast user and data bases of the parties and the synergies which can be created by judiciously commercialising this data.",CCI,en,Economic Times India
