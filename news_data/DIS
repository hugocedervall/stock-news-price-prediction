The first would be timing: just in time for the holiday season, the film, directed by Sharon Maguire (best known for Bridget Jones’s Diary), proffers fresh Disney princess canon at the tail end of an abysmal year, with audiences primed for cheerful, nuclear family escapism. There’s the comedic bona fides of its two leads, Isla Fisher and Jillian Bell, and a winning, suitably modernized premise: a well-meaning yet naively bumbling godmother on a mission to revitalize a harried single mother in present-day Boston, a fairytale trope isolated and reforged for pre-pandemic but still decidedly uninspired times.

She timed her album releases for awards contention and singles to sustain her world tours; the promotional cycle for 1989, released in 2014, seemed to go on for years. With coronavirus, that “circus” – as she puts it on Mirrorball, one of a few songs on her “quarantine album”, Folklore , that address the pandemic directly – was abruptly called off. Stripped of those structures, “this lockdown could have been a time where I absolutely lost my mind”, Swift says in The Long Pond Studio Sessions, a film that explores the making and meaning of Folklore. Instead, in a matter of months, she created an album as good as any she has ever written.

But, the worst seems to be behind the legendary entertainment giant. The Effects of a Global Pandemic Although the majority of Disney's theme parks managed to reopen during the company's fiscal fourth quarter at a limited capacity, the continued closure of Disneyland California was a big financial hit. It is certain that it will remain closed until the end of the year as state guidelines prohibit reopening until coronavirus cases in counties fall below 1 per 100,000.

The closure of the public schools in New York this week was a response to the Covid test positivity rate climbing above 3%, but was also, one imagines, put in place in anticipation of a greater surge after Thanksgiving.

Seven months later, yet another Pixar movie is ready to roll out to audiences around the world, but we're no closer to theaters being open in the US than we were in April. As a result, Soul will make its debut on Disney+ as well on Christmas Day. Soul might be the biggest release of the month for Disney+, but December will also see the arrival of three new episodes of The Mandalorian , including the finale on December 18th. ",DIS,en,BGR

Foster was approached by George Lucas to write a novelisation of Star Wars: A New Hope, which was published at the end of 1976, shortly before the film was released. Foster alleges that when Disney acquired Lucasfilm in 2012, it bought the rights to the novel as well as the first Star Wars sequel novel, Splinter of the Mind’s Eye, published in 1978. Disney’s acquisition of 20th Century Fox in 2019 meant it also acquired the rights to Foster’s novelisations of Alien, Aliens and Alien 3.

Banking, industrials, materials, transportation, and energy stocks did well while technology and communications fell sharply. The divergence of winners and losers was one for the ages.

On the whole, Goldman elevated 60 people to partner status, which brings the total number of partners at the elite Wall Street firm to fewer than 440, a reduction in the historical partner class size, which reflects CEO David Solomon's efforts to tighten the pool on the partner class and make it more exclusive.

It was his birthday. A few weeks earlier Clayborne learned that three of the Sway Boys — 18-year-old Josh Richards, and 21-year-olds Bryce Hall and Griffin Johnson— wanted to become venture capitalists, buying ownership stakes in hot startups, hoping those startups succeed and rise in value. As a Y Combinator graduate, Lendtable had already attracted about $1.5 million in pre-seed money from investors like Facebook crypto engineer Ramnik Arora. Clayborne was in the process of raising what would become a $4.5 million seed round from a who's who of investors, including Softbank . Clayborne was curious if his company could benefit from a new type of younger, hipper influencer investor. So he went to the opulent Bel Air home to meet them. ",DIS,en,Business Insider

In a quarterly earnings statement Wednesday, the broadcaster said the value of those assets have shrunk by almost half.Profit from those sports business may tumble 30% this year, according to Geetha Ranganathan, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Sinclair faces pressure because it has $12.5 billion in debt and has failed to secure contracts from Hulu and YouTube to carry the channels. The broadcaster bought the networks from Walt Disney Co., which had agreed to sell the properties as part of its takeover of 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets.“The outlook for Sinclair’s sports segment looks murky given a $4.2 billion impairment charge, elevated levels of cord cutting and recent carriage blackouts,” Ranganathan said.Sinclair shares fell as much as 9% to $17.88 in New York.","DISH,DIS",en,Yahoo Finance

Mando ’s back and, like a lot of stressed single parents, he still hasn’t got time for any of your nonsense. The Star Wars spin-off from Disney+ works because it mimics its bounty-hunting main character and unwaveringly follows its own path. The Mandalorian has all the quirky luxuries of the fictional universe you know from the films – the monsters, the gadgets, the characters who only previously appeared in Return of the Jedi novelisations – yet it never lets the weight of expectation slow it down, as it does exactly what it wants. What it wants is to deliver sleek, lean action stories that jettison the lamer elements of the movies and focus on the cool bits. No to windy philosophising, yes to punch-ups against bipedal reptiles in bars with blue clientele. Less sentimentality over fallen heroes, more moments like the one halfway through the season two opener, where a failed attempt to snare a ravenous sand-worm leads to perhaps the funniest horrific death in the whole Star Wars canon.",DIS,en,The Guardian

The art and science of macro investing is comparing past business cycles with the present across a mosaic of different indicators and time frames to determine the most probable path forward for markets. Throughout time, financial markets and the economy have been intimately linked to cycles of expansion and contraction of money and credit. The Federal Reserve was created by bankers and enacted by Congress in 1913 to provide a more flexible and stable monetary and financial system, but by no means did the Fed repeal the business cycle. In fact, the central bank has often played a role in amplifying booms and busts. For example, after introducing large-scale purchases of government securities to stem the recession of 1923, the Fed continued to expand the money supply and suppress interest rates through the remainder of the 1920s.",DIS,en,Zero Hedge

The pandemic's arrival in the U.S. just a month before Quibi launched in April didn't help, but it isn't why the streaming startup failed. The problem is that it completely overestimated the market of people who care about what it was building. To briefly recap , Quibi was the extremely well-funded streaming video service that launched with the promise of a long roster of well-known stars. It had commitments from Disney, WarnerMedia, and others that would produce short (less than 10 minutes) video episodes that people could watch during the in-between times that you're riding the subway or waiting in line to check out at the grocery store. It even won two Emmys during its short life. Unfortunately, that was as good as it ever got.

It’s a film for the globalised 21st century (and presumably Netflix’s global audience): a Chinese story directed by an American – the veteran Disney animator Glen Keane – and voiced in English by actors of (mostly) east Asian heritage. Cathy Ang is Fei Fei, who is horrified when her dad (John Cho) brings home a new girlfriend ( Sandra Oh ) four years after her mum’s death. Fei Fei is a true believer in the mythical goddess Chang’e, who is said to languish on the moon, pining for her mortal lover. Our heroine reasons that if she can prove Chang’e and eternal love really do exist, her dad will have to chuck his girlfriend and devote himself to the memory of her mumThus, as a science whizz, she builds a spaceship.",DIS,en,The Guardian

So when Disney asked the rapper to pen a new tune for a new EP honouring Black lives and social justice, she thought to herself: ""How else can I talk about what's going on?"" She began to think from the perspective of a mother who lost her son to police brutality. Or a father whose daughter died simply because of the colour of her skin. Recorded under quarantine during the pandemic, Rapsody came up with the soulful rap tune ""Pray Momma Don't Cry."" She said she pulled from Sam Cooke's ""A Change Is Gonna Come"" and Marvin Gaye's ""Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology),"" calling the classic songs ""beautiful music but it was also heavy and real at the same time."" Crafting the lyrics after receiving the beat from veteran producer and frequent collaborator 9th Wonder, Rapsody thought of ""Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, Sandra Bland, Trayvon Martin.""

Disney's theme parks employed more than 100,000 people prior to the crisis. Warren criticized the layoffs not by looking at what the government did to catalyze them, but rather by examining Disney's financial decisions in the years leading up to the pandemic, according to Reuters . She wrote in a letter to Disney Executive Chairman Bob Iger and Chief Executive Officer Bob Chapek on Tuesday: “I would like to know whether Disney’s financial decisions have impacted the company’s decision to lay off workers. It appears that – prior to, and during the pandemic – Disney took good care of its top executives and shareholders – and now is hanging its front-line workers out to dry.” Warren seems to be unaware that Disney ""front line workers"" may also be shareholders in the company.",DIS,en,Zero Hedge

Like Mad Men, it is set in the late 1950s and early 60s and everything – especially the suited and booted, would-be conquering heroes at its core – looks slick and gorgeous. That much you might expect from a Disney-made tale of real life derring-do, but what is unexpected is that the show concentrates on what a mess everything was, including the astronauts (apart from John Glenn , apparently), behind the scenes.

Pause To Preview Comms Sector,"When you think about the earnings season straight ahead, it’s important to remember that not all sectors necessarily look equal. Among sectors, the Communication Services arena is one that might stand out as investors await a fresh round of company reports. Third-quarter earnings for the overall market are again expected to be extraordinarily gloomy for many S&P 500 companies overall—though once again with lowered expectations heading into earnings season. Research firm FactSet expects an overall average earnings pullback of 21.8%. That’s certainly better than the near-32% drop in the second quarter, but hardly something to cheer about. Then there’s the sector-specific market. And among sectors, Communication Services scores high marks from analysts, with 59% offering buy ratings on the sector, according to FactSet. That’s exactly where it stood in January and up a percentage point from May. The bulk of those buy ratings are in the Communications sector components many Americans rely on normally but have gravitated toward with more focus and attention since the pandemic began.",DIS,en,Benzinga

You know, I think that we're certainly looking for positive and uplifting things to watch at the moment. And, you know, as I say, celebrating the legacy of feminism, as this film does."" The film tells the story of the 1970 Miss World final which proved to be a defining moment for female empowerment. At the time, the world-famous beauty pageant was the most-watched show in the U.K., with viewing figures eclipsing even the moon landing. But the competition also attracted the attention of the Women's Liberation Movement who – during the show's live broadcast from London – invaded the stage and disrupted transmission.",DIS,en,AfricaNews

As one person wrote on Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ), “The next debate is probably going to be a fistfight in a fast-food parking lot.” Well, not literally, of course, but all the focus last night on jabs to the face meant neither candidate really painted a picture of what they think America should look like going forward, and that was something people did want to hear. Add that to a rise in virus cases and you get a recipe for a lower opening, with stock indices dipping into the red again following Tuesday’s declines. September is now on pace to be the first negative month since March, with the S&P 500 Index (SPX) entering today down nearly 5% since Aug. 31. Interestingly, the market had been doing pretty well during the debate itself but then fell going into the last hours ahead of the bell.

A federal trademark infringement lawsuit filed in Las Vegas accuses the movie company of improperly basing the new character in last year's ""Toy Story 4"" on Knievel, whose famous stunts included motorcycle jumps over the Caesars Palace fountain in Las Vegas and a row of buses at Wembley Stadium in London, and a rocket shot into Snake River Canyon in Idaho. Las Vegas-based K and K Promotions accuses Disney-owned Pixar of intentionally modeling the Caboom character, voiced by Keanau Reeves in the movie, after Knievel - although Knievel's name is never mentioned. Son Kelly Knievel, head of K and K, has had publicity rights to Evel Knievel's name since 1998, according to the Tuesday court filing in U.S. District Court.

No, the carnival isn’t back in town. These are the raw ingredients for Ann Veronica Janssens’ sparkling takeover of South London Gallery (SLG). The glitter – iridescent blue with a hint of pink – has been strewn in armfuls across the wooden floor of SLG’s main Victorian gallery, like the offspring of Jackson Pollock’s studio floor and a Disney princess party. Walk past and it coruscates. Sneeze and it would shift. It’s so airy that it makes Katharina Grosse’s spray painting of the same space in 2017 look positively cumbersome. Midway through the show, the glitter will be swept up and thrown away, replaced with a set of highly polished bicycles that you are invited to ride, bouncing light around the room as you go. Janssens works in the realm of floaty impermanence, playing with light, space, reflection and perception.",DIS,en,The Guardian

I was more familiar with the fox and snake spirits in Chinese folklore that transformed into beautiful women and sorceresses, and the cross-dressing heroines of wuxia martial-arts TV shows of the 90s. It’s no surprise, then, that Disney’s 1998 film Mulan was more relatable than Sleeping Beauty. Mulan was not only Chinese but had a mission greater than marriage – to save her father and country – and she didn’t need saving herself. For Disney, she was the first “non-princess” who did not end up marrying a prince. It was a mortal’s story: there were no spells or supernatural forces to help her fight her battles, and she did not levitate off rooftops like the wuxia women.",DIS,en,The Guardian

Enola Holmes is yet another revisionist spin on an over-filmed story, but unlike her elder brother, spunky young Enola (delightfully played by Millie Bobby Brown) has a vested interest in changing a world that doesn’t suit her at all. It has become easy to label any story led by a female character as “empowering”, but Enola Holmes goes beyond mere lip service.

The pandemic has accelerated cord cutting as the number of streaming services grows while advertisers cut linear TV budgets and rework big commitments with networks like NBCUniversal, Disney, and ViacomCBS. And AT&T — one of the biggest sellers of targeted, or so-called addressable advertising — is reportedly mulling spinning off its pay-TV service DirecTV and digital ad firm Xandr that was supposed to help it along. Addressable advertising has always represented a small amount of TV inventory, but the coronavirus has exposed some of its pitfalls like high ad prices, a lack of measurement standards, and growing competition from streaming TV companies. When the coronavirus shut down production schedules and sports, advertisers pulled their addressable campaigns along with national ad spend, said Matt Kramer, managing director of advanced advertising at Omnicom Media Group.",DIS,en,Business Insider

2020-09-06 05:00:21-05:00,Mulan review – Disney's dynamic girl warrior hits the small screen…,"This terrific live-action remake, which favours spectacle over actual bloodshed, cries out to be seen in cinemas The most muscular live-action Disney remake to date, and certainly the most cinematic, Niki Caro’s junior wuxia interpretation of the tale of the girl warrior in ancient China goes all out on (somewhat sanitised) spectacle. But while not a drop of actual blood is shed, the screen is drenched in symbolic crimson – a smart subliminal acknowledgement that a film with this much extravagant swordplay should, by rights, be awash with gore. Caro inherited a schematic plot – Mulan (Liu Yifei) risks shame for her family when she dresses as a boy and goes to fight in her father’s place. But the film-makers strip away the softer elements – there are no songs – to reveal a propulsive action adventure. The combat set pieces are terrific, the scale of the storytelling is epic. It’s a film that cries out to be seen in the cinema. Disney’s decision to bypass a theatrical release in favour of streaming does a disservice to both the film and its audience.",DIS,en,The Guardian

""The modern media company [has] everything to do with the combination of content, distribution, data and technology,"" Brian Lesser, an ad agency vet who was brought on to carry out this plan, explained in 2018. ""AT&T alone has the components to solve this problem."" The mantra was, bigger was better. The idea was that by melding data, distribution, and content, AT&T could juice its slowing core wireless business, because there are only so many phone services people can sign up for, and take on Facebook and Google's dominance of digital advertising. In short order, AT&T acquired DirecTV for $48.5 billion, Time Warner for $84.5 billion, and digital ad company AppNexus for $1.6 billion. Lesser has since left AT&T, and AT&T is reportedly hanging a for-sale sign on assets outside its core telco business, including its digital ad business Xandr and streaming service Crunchyroll .",DIS,en,Business Insider

The novel coronavirus pandemic is still out of control in many places, with several countries reporting thousands to tens of thousands of new cases per day. Even the regions where the first wave of COVID-19 was contained aren’t safe, as the virus is still spreading in communities. Vaccines and over-the-counter drugs that can prevent complications aren’t available, and testing and contact tracing campaigns might not always catch all the people who were exposed to the virus and got infected.

The novel coronavirus pandemic has taken a heavy toll on the movie industry, with studios having to decide between delaying their new releases for months on end or dropping them on digital platforms and hoping that they could make at least a fraction of what they would have made at the box office. Disney attempted both strategies in the early days of the viral pandemic, delaying Black Widow to fall while releasing Onward on Disney+ around the time that it would have hit theaters. Onward turned out to be the exception to the rule, as Disney made it clear that potential blockbusters like Mulan and Black Widow would never debut digitally.

It is by the TV veteran Silas Howard, who was the first trans director of the show Transparent , and adapted by Daniel Pearle from his own award-winning stage-play. But it’s a film that strenuously avoids its own potential for satire or humour, averting its gaze from the #firstworldproblems issue. Claire Danes and Jim Parsons play Alex and Greg, a well-to-do New York couple: she’s a former lawyer turned stay-at-home mom and he’s a therapist. They have a bright, imaginative four-year-old, Jake (Leo James Davis), and like many parents in their milieu, they have allowed themselves to get obsessed with getting Jake into an exclusive private pre-school.

2020-08-25 15:08:00-05:00,10 Safe Dividend Stocks You Can Rely On,"When investors evaluate dividend stocks, they'll typically look at the yield first, then maybe delve into how much it's growing. Far less exciting is how safe the dividend is – but if 2020 isn't a lesson in why it's important to invest in safe dividend stocks, nothing is. Hundreds of companies have reduced or suspended their dividends this year , including dozens of big-name firms such as Boeing ( BA ), Ford ( F ) and Disney ( DIS ). For younger investors, that's less money you can put back to work and compound over time. For investors who rely on dividends in retirement , that's literally an income reduction that can negatively impact your quality of life. So, how do you identify safe dividend stocks? One of the easiest places to start is with the dividend payout ratio, which measures the percentage of profits that are paid out as distributions. It's an easy calculation: Simply divide dividends per share by earnings per share. The higher the percentage, the more net profits go toward sustaining the dividend – and the more risk that a sudden reduction in profits would lead to a negative dividend action.",DIS,en,Kiplinger Washington Editors

But Team 007 is wimping out, unwilling to splurge their product irreversibly into some potential new ruinous lockdown – and Disney has suffered a comparable bottle-loss, dumping its live-action version of the Mulan legend on to streaming services. So it’s up to the mighty Christopher Nolan to take the heroic, morale-boosting gamble and open his big new film in cinemas. Tenet is a gigantically confusing, gigantically entertaining and gigantically gigantic metaphysical action thriller in which a protagonist called The Protagonist battles cosmic incursions from the future while time flows backwards and forwards at the same time. There’s a 747 plane that crashes into a warehouse and then uncrashes back out of it, for reasons that are not immediately obvious.",DIS,en,The Guardian

2020-08-24 03:00:19-05:00,How Christopher Nolan became the king of the family-friendly films,"By consistently aiming his movies at the PG-13/12A certificate, the director has made himself cinema’s pre-eminent big-budget auteur You can count the directors who’ve been able to command budgets over $200m (£152m) for original blockbusters on one hand, and still have fingers left over. There’s James Cameron, now apparently intent on spending the rest of his career making sequels to his $237m (£181m) Avatar. There’s Christopher Nolan, whose next movie, Tenet , has soared well over that $200m mark. And, well, that’s it. Every other film coming in north of $200m is an adaptation, sequel, spin-off, reimagining or tie-in. Nolan is now out there on his own as that rarest of things: a mega-budget auteur – the one film-maker permitted to take such huge financial punts with wholly new ideas. Nolan carved this enviable niche in several ways. Firstly, he reliably makes very good films. His lowest-rated on Rotten Tomatoes is Interstellar with 72%, while Memento , Insomnia , The Dark Knight and Dunkirk are all above 90%.",DIS,en,The Guardian

As everyone likely knows, things are far from normal, so there’s a new spin around these earnings and many others to come.

He was the fiercely talented lyricist and musical-theatre wizard who ran his own off-off-Broadway producing venue in the 70s, turned Roger Corman’s Little Shop of Horrors into a mainstream stage smash, got signed up by Disney for animations such as The Little Mermaid, Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast and, sadly, became the first person with Aids to get an Oscar (posthumously). It’s moving to see Ashman rehearsing his song Part of Your World from The Little Mermaid, and to see how it relates to his own unforgotten childhood when he yearned to be part of the magical world of show business. Ashman set a standard of flair, invention and Broadway-style showmanship in Disney lyrics that continues to this day. Continue reading.",DIS,en,The Guardian

It all seems innocuous, fun and sometimes even silly.But in recent days, President Donald Trump has talked of banning TikTok from the United States, spooking the millions of people who make or watch TikTok videos for entertainment. Discussions of a ban have been coupled with reports that Microsoft or other companies may potentially buy the U.S. operations of the app.So what gives? Here’s a primer on how the app became embroiled with the White House and on the deal talks.What is the issue with TikTok?It all starts with two factors. One is that TikTok is owned by a Chinese internet company, ByteDance.

2020-07-28 10:50:45-05:00,Leak says a huge Avengers crossover movie is coming before Avengers 5,"The only Marvel movie still set to premiere in 2020 is Black Widow , which will be released in early November if the coronavirus pandemic has died down enough by then. With the MCU Phase 4 schedule delayed, Marvel isn’t expected to make any announcements about its future plans for standalone Avengers movies. A new rumor says a new “mini-Avengers” type of movie is coming even sooner than we thought, echoing a previous report that said this movie could set up Avengers 5 just like Civil War did with Infinity War . Our biggest gripe with MCU Phase 4 is that there’s no Avengers 5 movie in it — well, on top of the fact that the novel coronavirus forced Disney to delay all of its movie releases and pause production work. Phase 4 has no Fantastic Four or X-Men titles in it either. As we explained before, Phase 4 will be unlike anything Disney has done so far. Marvel will combine six movies and at least eight limited TV series into a single narrative. For the first time, TV shows will be used extensively to flesh out character arcs and offer more background to the story, and that’s because Disney now operates a popular streaming service of its own and it wants to lure in as many subscribers as possible.",DIS,en,BGR

Or, if your aged parent is no longer easily portable, an adult child can be substituted, à la Bradley Walsh (and Barney) on ITV’s Breaking Dad. So, who is the celebrity attraction in Rogue Trip? British viewers may struggle to correctly pick out the news anchor Bob Woodruff, but he has been a familiar square jaw on US television since he joined ABC News in 1996. In January 2006, his career path took a diversion when he sustained a brain injury from a roadside bomb in Iraq. Now all that experience – of reporting from war zones and adapting to unforeseen change – has been channelled into this new series for Disney+. Over the course of its six episodes, Bob and his 28-year-old son, Mack, will visit places including Papua New Guinea, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Lebanon and Ukraine. “Rougish nations” is their term to describe these former no-go conflict zones, which are beginning to open up to travellers.",DIS,en,The Guardian

But behind the scenes the company, owned by one of China’s biggest tech firms, is also scooping up massive amounts of data on Americans and tracking users’ every move.Security researchers say TikTok’s information-collection practices are consistent with Facebook Inc., Google and other U.S. tech companies looking to tailor ads and services to their users. The bigger issue lies in what TikTok does with the intel it gathers.

And those problems exist on the end of data transmission that no one but TikTok can see,” said Oded Vanunu, head of products vulnerability research at Check Point Software Technologies Ltd., who discovered a security hole in the app last year that has since been resolved.There’s little doubt the backlash against TikTok stems in part from the ongoing economic and political rivalry between Washington and Beijing.",DIS,en,Economic Times India

During the pandemic of 2020, community spaces that are private venues, like Disney, have closed down just as often as community spaces that are public venues, like schools and playgrounds. Public and private distinctions do not make a difference. Risk is the key factor to understanding why common spaces are closed and likely to remain so, at least in the way we were used to. In what is called the asymmetric loss function, a decision maker’s cost of a mistake in one direction is many times greater than the cost of error in the other direction. Individuals with asymmetric loss functions are extremely risk averse when it comes to potential losses. Individuals often employ asymmetric loss functions in everyday life. For most people being 30 minutes early for a flight, for example, is much less costly than being 30 minutes late.",DIS,en,Zero Hedge

As Q2 earnings reports begin trickling in, investors everywhere should prepare for what one headline writer called “The Ugliest Earnings Season since the Financial Crisis.” The year-over-year fallout from the coronavirus pandemic that kept most of the world in family confinement for many months has widely been expected to show its nastiest side in Q2 earnings results, and we’re about to find out how hideous it was. FactSet, for example, is predicting all 11 sectors of the S&P 500 could fall into negative territory for a white-knuckled 43.8% drop into the earnings abyss for the quarter. The biggest loser leaders include Energy, Consumer Discretionary, Industrials and Financial sectors, according to FactSet’s John Butters. “If -43.8% is the actual decline for the quarter, it will mark the largest year-over-year decline in earnings for the index since Q4 2008 (-69.1%),” he wrote in a recent update.

Disney touches on the answer to one of the biggest questions fans had left after Endgame , seemingly closing the Infinity story once and for all. The Marvel Cinematic Universe is on an indefinite break right now because of the novel coronavirus pandemic. The virus can spread with ease, which makes going to the theater practically impossible. That’s why Disney postponed Black Widow and all of its other productions that are currently in the works.

It’s WandaVision, a series that will introduce a bunch of new elements to the MCU and give us a better look at Wanda, who is currently the strongest Avenger. A couple of reports have revealed the limited TV series will be even longer than we initially thought, but we still have no idea when the show will finally hit Disney+. This was supposed to be Marvel Studios' boldest year so far, but then the novel coronavirus pandemic hit. Phase 4 will be the first MCU stage where the story is told with the help of regular films and TV series. You can argue that Marvel made other TV shows connected to the movies, including Agent Carter and Agents of SHIELD , but those weren't Marvel Studios projects and they pale in comparison to Marvel's movies.

2020-06-30 09:30:00-05:00,US digital video ad spending committed upfront will grow by 11.0% this year,"This story was delivered to Insider Intelligence eMarketer Briefing subscribers earlier this morning. Insider Intelligence analyzes this industry and several others to provide in-depth analyst reports, proprietary forecasts, customizable charts, and more. Learn more about what we offer. US digital video ad spending committed upfront will grow by 11.0% this year to $4.65 billion, despite the overall decline in TV ad spending due to the pandemic. That growth is much slower than the 31.1% rise last year, though it will bounce back in 2021, increasing 24.8%. By contrast, US upfront TV spending will decline 1.4% in the 2019–2020 season and 27.1% in the 2020–2021 season. (Our definition of upfront digital video ad spending includes spending resulting from the TV Upfronts, the IAB Digital Content NewFronts and other events throughout the year.) There are two main drivers for the growth this year: The biggest digital video players (like Hulu, Roku and YouTube) will become more important as cord-cutting accelerates.

Purchase this report. To check to see if you already have access to Business Insider Intelligence through your company, click here. Esports and gaming have burst into the mainstream in recent years, transforming from a vibrant niche to a central form of entertainment around the world. While esports may have once stood for a subset of sports culture, it has grown into a full industry in its own right. That shift has been powered by championing from mainstream celebrities like Michael Jordan, Drake, and DJ Marshmello, an increasing amount of coverage from traditional outlets like ESPN, and, at least in part, the breakneck rise of Fortnite. As competitive gaming cements itself in the popular culture, global investors, brands, media outlets, and consumers are all paying attention. Total esports viewership is expected to grow at a 9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2019 and 2023, up from 454 million in 2019 to 646 million in 2023, per Business Insider Intelligence estimates.",DIS,en,Business Insider

Granted, China's daily stats have been trending toward zero for months, even if the world may never learn how many Chinese were actually infected - and how many actually died - during the outbreak. Nevertheless, the news seemed to energize Beijing, which announced that it might lower its 2020 GDP target ever so slightly even as Volkswagen, the world's biggest carmaker, reported a strong rebound in China sales last month. Volkswagen CEO Stephan Wöllenstein says in a blog post published Wednesday that the carmaker is aiming to hit its pre-corona sales targets for the world's largest car market - however difficult that might be to believe. The notion that the Chinese auto market could be ""back to normal"" by summer - as Wöllenstein claims - sounds far-fetched, considering that certain restrictions on movement remain in Hubei and elsewhere.",DIS,en,Zero Hedge

With so many hours to fill, it seemed like a sensible investment. Pretty soon, it was infiltrating my every waking hour. By Sophie Elmhirst A few weeks ago, on a day that was probably like today now that the days are all frighteningly different and yet strangely the same, Disney launched Disney+, its new streaming service, in the UK. The precise date, for those that are still tracking such things, was 24 March, which was also, by coincidence, the date the British lockdown officially started. I had been waiting, impatiently, for both. One felt frivolous, the other historic – a new thing to watch to add to the endless other things to watch versus the sudden transformation of an entire population’s way of life – and yet here they were entwined, perfectly compatible bedfellows. Disney couldn’t have known that the launch of Disney+ would fall upon the same day that 66 million people would be instructed to stay at home for 23 hours a day.",DIS,en,The Guardian

What makes Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame so great is the sense of danger. The former makes it clear early on that people might die, and that the stakes are real. By the time it finishes, you're left with only half of your favorite heroes standing, and they've all been defeated. The others have been turned to dust, but it's immediately clear that it will all be fixed in the next Avengers installment. But it's also obvious that whatever the Avengers will have to do to save everyone else might come at tremendous cost. That cost, we learned a year after Infinity War premiered, was the death of Black Widow and Iron Man, and the retirement of Captain America.",DIS,en,BGR.com

Frozen 2 was snubbed and instead Laika crept back into the spotlight with Missing Link (after winning the Golden Globe) and Netflix snuck in with two originals – Klaus and I Lost My Body – marking the streamer’s first time breaking into the pack. While Toy Story 4 might have ultimately won out, the lineup continued to reflect both a widening field and an embrace of more left-field choices, a much-needed jolt of energy in what used to be a two-9horse race.

Experts say that while March is usually a slower month for advertising, many top spending categories — like auto, consumer durables, retail, and mobile phones— spend heavily during these two moths on IPL and the summer season. With IPL getting suspended and a nationwide lockdown in force, advertisers aren’t keen on spending marketing monies and broadcasters feel that the continuing uncertainty might bring more pain. “The media industry, which depends heavily on advertising revenues, is going to take a massive hit because of economic disruption.

The balance those studios have to strike is a difficult one, as some movies are better suited to release on digital than others.

But what to watch? Well, you can’t accuse Disney of not picking its moment – although, as it turns out, the universe really picked it for them. Nearly five months after its debut in the US, after a long-period of fan-frustrating non-confirmation and further waiting, the UK launch of the Disney+ streaming service is finally upon us, beaming into your living rooms and laptops from Tuesday. And just as self-isolation from the coronavirus is making home entertainment the only entertainment for many, the timing is almost morbidly perfect. After all, it’s not as if you’ll be able to get your Disney fix on the big screen for a while now: following the lead of several other studios, the Mouse House has indefinitely postponed the cinema release dates of blockbusters Mulan , The New Mutants and Antlers , with Black Widow widely expected to follow. Instead, for £5.99 a month or an annual subscription fee of £49.99 (which goes up by a tenner if you subscribe after the launch), you’ll be granted access to a slightly daunting array of Disney and Disney-adjacent content.",DIS,en,The Guardian

But have recent developments shown the chinks in its armour? So all-consuming and all-conquering has Disney become, it even owns the rights to its analogies now. First Disney was Marvel supervillain Thanos, relentlessly acquiring pop culture’s Infinity Stones including Pixar, Lucasfilm and Marvel itself – all the better to obliterate half the Hollywood universe. Having swallowed up its rival 21st Century Fox for a colossal $71bn, Disney became the Death Star – an empire so intimidatingly huge and hungry it reduced its rivals to the status of scattered rebels. Last year, Disney dominated the movies like no studio has before, taking more than 38% of the world’s box office. Now, with its streaming service Disney+ rolling out, Disney is like Simba in The Lion King: as Mufasa tells him, “everything the light touches is our kingdom”. Maybe not quite everything, yet. But Disney’s gravitational pull is warping the very space-time continuum of the media landscape.",DIS,en,The Guardian

Now there’s another piece of news that has fans concerned: the new adaptation will omit a popular character from the original film, Li Shang, voiced by B.D. Wong. In the 1998 version, Shang captained the army that the titular female warrior (Ming-Na Wen) joins under the guise of being a male recruit named Ping. Like Shang’s signature song goes , he somehow makes men out of his soldiers-in-training and, in the process, finds himself drawn to Ping in particular. By the end of the movie, romance has blossomed between the captain and his best fighter, whose real identity is exposed before the climactic battle.

First conjured up almost two decades ago under the now largely defunct Miramax studio, it has had to survive the departure of several directors, numerous attempts at a screenplay and the removal of Harvey Weinstein as producer. Unfortunately, as the film enters the final strait of its long journey to the multiplex, the news is not getting any better. Finally due out in May, with Kenneth Branagh in the director’s chair and a cast that includes Judi Dench, Colin Farrell and Josh Gad, the movie is now facing almost universal derision from fans of the eight-novel original series of books by Irish author Eoin Colfer that inspired it.

But here is a reminder of a another animation tradition that hails from Poland and central Europe, in the form of a feature from the Polish veteran Mariusz Wilczyński; it is raw, rough, fragmented, angry, often brilliant with its own kind of aesthetic brusquery and pain. This is not animation which is there to exalt, or soothe, or celebrate human loveliness: it is animation which takes a fiercely miserable satirical stab at the world and itself, a language which is unreconciled, unaccommodated.

The biggest blow has to be the loss of Black Panther , which is finally joining the vast majority of the other Marvel Cinematic Universe movies on Disney+ next month. Slowly but surely, Disney is completing its full collection of Marvel movies (but it's going to be a bit before Infinity War joins the party). Two other major losses are that of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King . As most of you know, these are two of the best fantasy epics in movie history, and seeing the entire trilogy taken off of Netflix is a bummer. Return of the King was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and won all of them, including Best Picture, making it the first fantasy movie to win the most coveted award in film.

Here's how Bumblebee Spaces' systems work.,"A San Francisco startup designs modules that store your bed, closet, desk, and nightstand in the ceiling that can be lowered on your command. The systems are also outfitted with AI that ""can learn from your preferences and routine."" Bumblebee Spaces was cofounded in 2017 by Tesla and Apple veteran Sankarshan Murthy.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . There have been a bunch of daring propositions to counter San Francisco's — and other cities' — housing demand: underground bunk beds are one of the most recent that come to mind. But Bumblebee Spaces is drawing inspiration from its namesake insect's penchant for space optimization and has designed systems that store furniture in the ceiling, which has traditionally been unused dead space. The San Francisco-based startup builds modular ceiling systems to ""unlock"" living space and double or triple the utility in high-density, high-dollar-per-square-foot regions, ""where space is a premium.""

Instead, Sony wanted to go it alone in an effort to create a ""Spider-verse"" universe of films that might rival the MCU.

Don’t forget that we have a five-year gap between Infinity War and Endgame that can be used to introduce other heroes and villains until we catch up with the MCU’s present-day (that's 2023-2024, per the events in Spider-Man: Far From Home ). Of all these films and TV shows, two titles stand out so far, as they should become pivotal moments in the main MCU timeline. Now, Marvel has confirmed that both of them will include ties to Endgame . They’re both movies, and they’re unique in different ways considering all the rumors and all of Marvel's recent official revelations. One of them is Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (May 7th, 2021), which will tie into Loki and WandaVision , according to Marvel.

Rise of Skywalker is now tied with Phantom Menace as the worst-reviewed Star Wars movie on record, and the only two with ""rotten"" ratings. Personally, I find Rotten Tomatoes to be a useful tool when it comes to deciding whether or not to spend $15+ on a movie ticket to see a movie I might not have seen otherwise. Parasite's 99% score certainly helped push me toward seeing it, and it's my favorite movie of the year by a mile. Rotten Tomatoes isn't the be-all-end-all, but for critics to be as down on Rise of Skywalker as they were on everyone's least favorite Star Wars movie is notable.

IndieWire reported on Monday that Bale is circling the role, with the character's details still shrouded in secrecy. Production on the movie, hitting theaters on November 5, 2021, is reportedly scheduled to begin this summer. For Bale, it would certainly not be the first time he's ventured into the world of comic book movie-making, seeing as he helped reinvigorate the Batman film franchise after years of misfires with DC cycling through one actor after another to portray Gotham's Dark Knight.

But the third installment in the newest trilogy will easily be the most exciting Spider-Man movie made to date. For the first time in recent history, we’ll get a story nobody ever dared to make, and now we've learned that it all starts shooting next summer. Sam Raimi or Marc Webb’s Spider-Man stories are rather boring compared to what Marvel did with the character after partnering with Sony to bring Spider-Man to the MCU. That’s because Sony wasn’t able or didn’t dare to think outside the box. Sony told the same story over and over until Spider-Man got out of the confines of Sony’s Spider-verse and got to play with other major Marvel characters. It’s one thing to see Spider-Man battle the same villains, fall in love with Mary Jane the same way, and deal with the loss of his parents, which is what Sony did until 2016.",DIS,en,BGR.com

Cloud companies like Salesforce pioneered the model, but experts say the 2008 financial crisis was the inflection point — as companies cut costs, the pay-as-you-go model became very attractive. Companies like Adobe and Microsoft made the switch to focus on a subscription model and have reaped the rewards, as their businesses boom. Subscription software companies say that the model is actually better for users — the software gets more features, more often, and customers don't have to pay a high sticker price up front to get started. However, critics note that over the course of the lifetime of a subscription, users will often pay more than they would have if they bought the software outright.

The film you’ve been anxiously awaiting for years premiered earlier this week to mixed reviews. The general opinion seems to be that it’s a great film for fans, with lots of moments that will please Star Wars enthusiasts with references to earlier films in the series. On the other hand, there are some questionable choices for the Rise of Skywalker plot that have the potential to ruin the current trilogy, maybe even the entire Skywalker saga .

Netflix’s cheapest plan ($8.99) only supports streaming SD shows to a single device at a time. If you pay for a full year of Disney+ access, the monthly cost goes down to $5.83. It’s no wonder that more than 10 million people subscribed to Disney+ at launch, with many of them having taken advantage of even cheaper pre-release deals. And that number may hit 20 million by the end of the year, according to recent estimates.

2019-12-10 19:37:11-05:00,Netflix could lose millions of subscribers as rivals continue to pick up steam,"For years now, the value proposition offered by Netflix has been absolutely incredible. Even with a string of price increases over the years, the ability to enjoy a wildly large library of quality content for as little as $8.99 remains a remarkable deal. In turn, it's no surprise that Netflix's subscriber base, over the last three years alone, jumped from 86 million to 158 million. The success of Netflix, however, spawned a new battleground for consumer attention in the media space. It's certainly an interesting development, especially given that Netflix not too long ago was on a path towards total streaming domination. Today, however, Netflix is facing stiff competition on all fronts as companies like Amazon, HBO, Disney, Hulu, and even Apple are trying to slowly but surely chip away at Netflix's subscriber base. Amid the new competition, which will only intensify once HBO Max rolls out, some analysts believe that Netflix losing a significant number of subscribers to competing services is an inevitability.",DIS,en,BGR.com

But a subsequent report by The Wall Street Journal said the two nations are working on a possible delay of the Dec. 15 tariffs. Equity index futures erased early losses to move into the green by the opening bell. A postponement or cancelation of those duties would likely please stock market participants, at least if the two sides can’t reach an interim deal before then. The world’s two largest economies have been trying to hammer out a deal for some time now, and uncertainty surrounding the trade situation has been the biggest headwind facing Wall Street. But recently, excitement about a partial trade deal getting done soon has helped push the market to record highs.

Apple's 'The Morning Show' has more Golden Globe nominations than 'Game of Thrones',"The Golden Globes nominations are out and we have a few surprises right out of the gate. The biggest one is extremely satisfying, considering what we had to go through earlier this year. Game of Thrones season 8 was the worst season in the show’s history, featuring one of the most awful series finales in television history. In spite of that, the 2019 Emmys netted HBO a record number of Thrones nominations, including an embarrassingly preposterous nom for best writing ( the final episode ). Thankfully, D.B. Weiss and David Benioff did not win, and weeks later the duo revealed they decided not to go forward with their Star Wars plans with Disney. If you feel like you need more reparations for what Thrones 8 put you through, you should know that the show has fewer Golden Globes nominations than Apple’s The Morning Show , which started playing on the newly launched Apple TV+ streaming service only a month ago.

Autoplay, which prompts the next episode of a TV series to begin as soon as the current one is finished, can be turned off with a few simple steps. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

So why is everyone else lagging behind? Here we (let it) go again. Frozen II has broken box-office records with presales before it has even been released, and will doubtless cap off a triumphant year for Disney Animation and its subsidiary Pixar. The revamped Lion King is the biggest animation of all time; Toy Story 4 has also taken more than a billion dollars. Cue more fist-shaking at the unassailable hugeness of Disney . But if any rival is hoping to overturn this, they will have to try a damned sight harder. At the beginning of the century, we considered ourselves in a “golden age” of animation, brought on by now-classic early Pixar titles Toy Story, The Incredibles and Finding Nemo, and the non-Pixar Shrek and Happy Feet. But looking around this year, you would have to acknowledge this era is over. Apart from Disney offerings, what have we had?

The hugely profitable, and mostly tiresome, trend of dusting off handcrafted classics and rehauling them for a new audience has sped up this year with Aladdin, The Lion King, Dumbo and a Maleficent sequel all released theatrically, the underwhelming box office of the latter two hinting at growing audience fatigue. The decision to premiere Lady and the Tramp digitally, morphing it into a TV movie, launching Disney’s splashy new content platform Disney+, is therefore a wise one and taken as such, it’s adequate if wholly unnecessary entertainment, ending up somewhere between a lady and a tramp.

Here’s an old-school, PG-rated animation, encompassing some digital wizardry, but generally clinging to a nostalgic, hand-drawn look, with a late-blooming Christmas theme. The director is the seasoned Sergio Pablos, who contributed to Disney’s Hercules and Tarzan and co-wrote Illuminations’ Despicable Me, and now assimilates several of those titles’ most appealing aspects. It also represents a half-decent attempt to revive the angular character design and irreverent humour Disney abandoned after the commercial failure of the underrated The Emperor’s New Groove . Disney’s current stewards would presumably also have nixed the dismal arctic location to which our jabbering postman hero Jesper (voiced by Jason Schwartzman) is exiled.

Even before AAPL unveiled its iPhone 11 in September, the company’s shares were on a run that might make the storybook dog Spot feel jealous. Since the phone’s launch, shares extended their gains to hit a new peak for the first time in more than a year, allowing AAPL to reclaim its mantle as the most valuable company in the world ahead of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ). While the iPhone might capture some headlines, China is another elephant in the room as earnings approach. One big improvement in AAPL’s fiscal Q3 from recent quarters was a rebound in China sales. They fell just 4% year-over-year in fiscal Q3 compared with 22% the quarter before. Consider listening for anything CEO Tim Cook has to say on the call about the situation in China and how the tariff battle is affecting AAPL’s operations there.",DIS,en,Benzinga Feeds

Researchers found that ""descriptive"" logos (logos with a visual reference, like Apple or Starbucks) resonate with consumers more than non-descriptive logos with abstract symbols. The difference isn't just aesthetic — descriptive logos translate into net profit by bonding with consumers. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. It turns out the on-trend logos are, the research says, getting it wrong. We've become used to seeing simple, elegant logos for many companies in recent years (think Mastercard , Dunkin' , or Slack ). But as new research suggests, many minimalist logos aren't effective because they don't indicate what the company does. An effective logo hints at what product or service is being offered. This translates to making a brand more profitable.

Amazon Prime Video has the most bang for your buck, as it's the cheapest option with the biggest catalog of movies and TV shows, as well as lots of quality films. But if you are seeking quality TV shows, Netflix and Hulu are better options for you. If you can put up with ads, Hulu is actually the cheapest option. But without ads, it's still less expensive than Netflix's standard HD plan. HBO Now is the most expensive option with fewer titles than its competition. The premium cable network has historically favored quality over quantity, but its parent company AT&T plans to ramp up the amount of original content it produces. Showtime has the fewest movies and TV shows by a wide margin, and is only a must-have if you are a fan of its original programming.

To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here. The service reportedly continues to have trouble carving out a strong position in Hollywood, as its broader content strategy remains vague, per The Information. In addition to mismanagement and turnover at Amazon Studios — only now stabilizing under Jennifer Salke's leadership — Amazon's video efforts have likely struggled due to hazy brand identity. Amazon's platform is for all things, albeit mostly for shopping. Prime Video is merely a perk within a broader ecosystem of services, and ultimately peripheral to the key touchstone of Prime membership: free 2- or 1-day shipping. And Amazon's emphasis on breadth has likely diluted Prime Video's unique value, as the SVOD platform might be thought of as just another offering within the e-tailer's broader suite. A major constituency confused about Amazon's identity is Hollywood talent and content producers, which could make it hard for the platform to consistently create high-quality original content.",DIS,en,Business Insider

Viacom generated $2.96 billion in its fiscal second quarter (ended March 31, 2019), down 6% from $3.15 billion year-over-year (YoY).

The average stock price target of the 7 analysts surveyed by FactSet has increased to $48.50 from $42 as of the end of April.",DIS,en,MarketWatch

To make a custom ringtone for an iPhone , you'll need to edit a song using iTunes on the computer. You can tweak the start and stop time, save it as an AAC file, and change the file extension. You can then drag the edited song to the Tones section of iTunes and sync it with your iPhone using a connection cable. It doesn't take long to get tired of the handful of ringtones that come with your iPhone . If you'd rather hear a song when you have an incoming call, Apple would like you to pay a dollar or more per ringtone in the Tones store.

AT&T has dropped NFL Network and NFL Red Zone channels from its fiber TV service U-verse and skinny bundle service DirecTV Now, per Deadline. AT&T's deals with the NFL quietly expired and the company hasn't made any moves to renew them with the league. The channels remain on DirecTV, the satellite pay-TV service. What it means: The removal of the channels from AT&T's digital services could be an early sign that the NFL might seek new distribution for Sunday Ticket, the package of out-of-market games that has been distributed exclusively with DirecTV for the past 25 years. NFL rights could increasingly become divvied among various partners, reducing exclusivity. A new deal for Sunday Ticket could include DirecTV plus a digital partner like Amazon: NFL commissioner Roger Goodell signaled last month that he was looking for a streaming partner for the package, per Bloomberg.",DIS,en,Business Insider

2019-04-14 00:00:22-05:00,Lady Gaga Could Save a French Tycoon’s Really Lousy Year,"(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- The past year has been unusually harsh for French billionaire Vincent Bolloré. The former chairman of media giant Vivendi SA was implicated in a bribery scandal in Africa, his electric car-sharing program in Paris shut down, and he’s losing a battle for control of Telecom Italia—the troubled carrier at the heart of his plan to create a southern European entertainment juggernaut. He faces a further potential blow at Vivendi’s annual meeting on April 15, where proxy advisory firms are recommending that shareholders reject a measure that would let Bolloré increase his control of the company. Despite the setbacks, help is on the way—from Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, and U2. Vivendi is planning to sell a 49 percent stake in Universal Music Group, the world’s biggest recording house. The sale could bring in more than $15 billion for Vivendi and send its stock soaring, analysts say—a payout that would deliver billions to Bolloré’s holding company, Vivendi’s No. 1 stockholder.",DIS,en,Bloomberg

2019-03-16 05:55:40-05:00,Here's how a tiny toymaker dodged the Toys R Us disaster that whacked Hasbro and Mattel (FNKO),"Toys R Us store closures and liquidation sales hammered Hasbro, Mattel, Spin Master and Jakks Pacific last year. Funko was hardly affected due to its large and diversified customer base, multiple sales channels, and devoted shoppers. The liquidation of Toys R Us and closure of more than 800 of its toy stores hammered Hasbro, Mattel, Spin Master and Jakks Pacific last year, as their recent results show. The only major toy stock to escape the fallout was Funko, thanks to its diversified customer base, range of sales channels, and devoted buyers. How did Funko dodge the Toys R Us bullet? In stark contrast to its peers, Funko's sales jumped 33% to $686 million last financial year, driving operating profit up 51% to $63.5 million. Funko - which makes pop-culture figurines and bobbleheads under licence from Disney, Netflix, Nintendo, Warner Bros. and others - relied on Toys R Us for less than 4% of its sales in 2017, meaning its sales were hardly affected by the retailer's sudden demise. The key differences between Funko and rivals are that its "" products are channel-agnostic, and we have a diverse set of customers, of which no retailer accounts for more than 10% of our year's sales to date,"" CEO Brian Mariotti said on the group's third-quarter earnings call . ""Because of this, we have been successful in regaining any sales we would have lost because of [Toys R Us] with other retailers."" Funko doesn't publicly break out its sales channels.",DIS,en,Business Insider
