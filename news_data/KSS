As a result, when it comes to most prices in the electronics bucket, Amazon has some of the highest online prices now compared to such upstart online competitors as Walmart and Target , which are now in the unenviable position of having to undercut Amazon's prices to win market share. So is it indeed the case that Amazon's prices are now above its competitors? Not necessarily. This morning, Goldman published the takeaways from week 3 of its annual holiday pricing survey in which the bank captured the online prices of selected baskets of goods at WMT, TGT, AMZN, KR, ULTA, M, KSS, WSM, BBBY, JWN, DKS and Sephora as of November 10th.",KSS,en,Zero Hedge

Respondents noted that Amazon will steal holiday spend from a number of other retailers too, including Best Buy (23%), Kohl's (20%), JCPenney (18%), and eBay (16%). This suggests that, despite its already well-established position, there's still room for Amazon to disrupt other top retailers' performances, even during the all-important holiday season.
