The bank's chief US equity strategist and chief investment officer said in a Monday note that he expects the market to drop another 10% in the near term as investors face uncertainty around the election outcome, more fiscal stimulus, and another wave of COVID-19. But once the dust settles, Wilson said he expects the bull market to ensue — one which will be led by cyclical and smaller-cap stocks as earnings get a boost from the economic recovery. As such, Wilson recommended using a near term sell-off as a buying opportunity. ""We think the best opportunities lie in stocks where earnings are growing with the cyclical rebound and growing by enough to offset any valuation headwinds,"" Wilson said. He continued: ""On any pullbacks, we would look to our earnings upside screen from September — 66% of stocks have outperformed the market with median outperformance of 2.","HOG,HLI",en,Business Insider

The partnership will likely be announced this week.Initially, both parties are set to announce a distribution agreement. The size – and scope – of that arrangement could extend into a mid-size motorcycle project (for 300-500 cc vehicles) in three to five years. That will enable Hero to enter the premium end of the home market, while Harley can take a stab at the segment now dominated by Royal Enfield.ET learns that Hero is being advised by Goldman Sachs on the proposed partnership. Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the queries. In response to ET’s query, Hero Motocorp said it does not comment on market speculation. Separately, Harley said it is evaluating options and would keep its ‘Indian dealers and customers informed.’The partnership is similar to the Bajaj-Triumph alliance, wherein both companies (Hero-Harley) will jointly develop the platform and use India as a production base for the world market.The move will reinforce Harley’s ‘Hard Wire’ plan to come out stronger and profitable by 2025.78611638“The distribution is the first step; the core of the discussions is the joint project, which is why both partners have come together.",HOG,en,Economic Times India

They also stem from his criticism of NRC and CAA.Obviously, these criticisms may well pique segments of India’s attentive public. That said, it would be a critical error to assume that a handful of statements made on the campaign trail are somehow indicative of the overall orientation of Biden’s likely foreign policy towards India. Instead, it is worth examining his prior record as well as his general foreign policy stance to glean some meaningful clues about his possible India policy.

Like the name suggests, the company ordered parts only when it received new car orders. To give a clearer picture, the inventory management system, developed by Taiichi Ohno, a Toyota industrial engineer, was aimed at aligning production, eliminating waste and help producers forecast demand accurately. Within no time, the JIT model revolutionised the business world and was quickly adapted by many small and big enterprises in the world, including Dell, Harley Davidson and McDonalds. The JIT strategy saved huge amounts of expenditure cost with low inventory costs, high quality production and low wastage. The two environments where it worked best were manufacturing and retail. Unfortunately, the JIT inventory caused Toyota’s operations to nearly come to a halt after a fire in 1997 at the company’s automotive parts supplier, Asinin, severely impacted its capacity to produce certain parts.",HOG,en,Economic Times India

The company launched its first electric motorcycle, the $29,799 LiveWire, last August. “We’ll expand our profitable iconic heritage bikes to excite our existing customers,” CEO Jochen Zeitz told investors this week. “We also remain committed to … advancing our efforts in electric,” he added, before the company revealed a 45 percent drop in quarterly profits. While unlikely to appeal to freewheeling Harley-Davidson purists, the LiveWire was drawing praise even before launch and has raised eyebrows since thanks to stunts such as beating a Tesla Model 3 in a drag race and travelling 1,000 miles in 24 hours (thanks to fast charging). Perhaps surprisingly given its classic heritage, Harley-Davidson is something of an early mover in the electric motorcycle market, compared to other traditional manufacturers. Other industry leaders such as Honda and Kawasaki also boast electric models, but to a large extent the nascent e-motorcycle market is occupied by electric-only startups such as Energica and Zero.","HOG,HMC",en,Green Technology

2020-03-01 03:14:41-05:00,"As dust settles on Trump's trip, a relook at the road ahead on trade","By Amit KapoorIn over seven decades of its independent history, India’s relationship with the United States have always been complicated. The Cold War dynamics and India’s nuclear ambitions had dictated the individual leanings of both nations before the turn of the new millennium. But since Clinton’s visit to India in 2000, economics has become the defining feature of the relationship. India’s economic rise post-liberalisation and its unique position to counter-balance China’s dominance in Asia places it in a favourable light from the US perspective. However, the complicated nature of the equation has not yet resolved itself.In fact, Donald Trump’s visit to India – despite all the bonhomie on display – came in the backdrop of some hot and cold trade-related negotiations between the two nations that are yet to fructify. Trump has been quite vocal about his stand with respect to Indian markets and has constantly bashed the country as the ‘tariffs king’. As far back as March 2017 – two months after taking office – in his first address to the US Congress, Trump singled India out for charging 100 per cent tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorcycles.",HOG,en,The Economic Times India

Officials from both sides since then have been trying to hammer out a modest agreement, which would open up India to American exports of agricultural products and medical devices in return for a restoration of India’s preferential status.People familiar with the negotiations say they had been making progress until recent days, building expectations of an announcement during Trump’s Feb. 24-25 visit. But Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative, canceled a planned visit to the country last week as the talks appeared to stall -- as they had ahead of a visit to the U.S. last year by Narendra Modi, India’ prime minister.Trump appeared to confirm that on Tuesday when he told reporters that he still wanted to do “a very big trade deal with India,” but added “I don’t know if it will be done before the election.”“We’re not treated very well by India, but I happen to like Prime Minister Modi a lot,” he added.The negotiations have centered on U.S. demands for greater access to the Indian market sought by American makers of stents and other medical devices as well as dairy farmers -- two constituencies that were behind the push that led to Trump’s decision last year to suspend India’s privileges under the Generalized System of Preferences program for developing countries.Alfalfa HayIndia has offered greater market access for American farm products ranging from alfalfa hay to pecans and dried distillers grains.",HOG,en,The Economic Times India

The US removed India from the list on account of it being a G-20 member and having a share of 0.5% or more of world trade. The move has cast a shadow on India being able to restore preferential benefits under the Generalised System of Preference (GSP) as part of its trade talks with the US, as only developing countries are eligible for it.“For purposes of US CVD law, the USTR therefore considers countries with a share of 0.5% or more of world trade to be developed countries,” the USTR said in a federal notice.",HOG,en,The Economic Times India

The move also follows the US abruptly ending preferential tariffs for some Indian exports earlier this month. Such a move, if implemented, will be taking place just ahead of meetings between US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the G20 summit on June 28-29 in Osaka. Also coming up later this month is a visit by US secretary of state Mike Pompeo to India for bilateral talks with counterpart S Jaishankar. Pompeo said on Thursday that the US was open to discussions on the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP).Higher duties have been proposed on apples, walnuts, chickpeas, lentils, boric acid and diagnostic reagents. The move, which was triggered by the US announcing higher tariffs on Indian steel and aluminium last year, was deferred multiple times in view of the trade dialogue between the two countries.“There will be no further extension of the retaliatory tariffs,” said an official aware of the development, adding that the commerce department and external affairs ministry are on the same page on the decision.Trump has repeatedly called out India for its high tariffs, even though the two countries have developed close political and security ties, often citing levies on Harley Davidson motorcycles.",HOG,en,The Economic Times India
2019-06-12 10:22:17-05:00,Why India must further lower Harley tariffs,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi is slated to meet US President Donald Trump later this month, at the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan. Observers and analysts will be looking for political substance at the meet. Note that a US-India-Japan trilateral is scheduled to take place then, so as to further the ground work for a stable Indo-Pacific that guarantees free navigation for all seafaring nations. But for starters, we need to speedily get the issue of seemingly high tariffs on imports of Harley Davidson motorcycles out of the way. Now, Trump has indeed taken note of the fact that his “good friend Modi” has halved duty on Harley mobikes to 50% lately, and further that the tariffs are still far too high. We can surely do more, and not merely to humour Trump. There are no large-engine mobike manufacturers like Harley in India. And import volumes of the iconic brand here are rather small. Yet as India picks up economic speed, the demand for such large motorcycles is likely to accelerate and zoom. Hence the express need to incentivise stepped-up local demand for the heavier mobikes by dutifully rationalising tariffs on their imports.",HOG,en,The Economic Times India

The US said Indian protectionism was unfairly hurting US exports. Lengthy bilateral negotiations failed to avert this setback, which will hit $5.7 billion of Indian exports covering 5,111 tariff lines. This sad outcome reflects faulty priorities and inflexibility in India’s economic diplomacy, with losses far exceeding gains.The commerce ministry tried to put a brave face on it by saying that US tariffs that will now be imposed are low, often below 4 per cent, so the loss of preferences will amount to only $190 million. This grossly understates the problem. Many Indian labour-intensive exports are sold at very thin margins of 2 per cent or less, so even small duties can render uncompetitive billions of dollars’ worth of Indian exports. Competitors like Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia continue to get duty-free treatment from the US, and so will gain at India’s expense.History shows that no country has become a miracle economy – defined as achieving 7 per cent GDP growth for over a decade – without buoyant exports.",HOG,en,The Economic Times India

He said the company has had no dialogue with the Indian government to reduce taxes and, as in all other countries, will stick to the “rule of the land” to do business. Terming India “a very high-tariff nation”, US President Donald Trump recently said he will end preferential treatment for a host of Indian goods that now enter the country “dutyfree”.India will no longer receive benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) set up to promote trade from developing countries.",HOG,en,The Economic Times India

2019-01-30 18:35:00-05:00,A Markets Game Plan For US-China Trade Talks,"Authored by Garfield Reynolds, Bloomberg markets live commentator For markets, trade talks dominate everything else this week, so here’s a simplified game plan for how it might play out. China’s cooling economy, soggy earnings from the likes of Caterpillar, Nvidia, Harley Davidson, plus a slew of weak export data prints have helped create a consensus that what the markets need more than anything else is trade peace. Such a view may be naïve. China deleveraging, Brexit, Italy, the U.S. shutdown have all done plenty of harm too. Plus, repairing the already-seen trade war damage will be a gradual and difficult process. But that’s mostly beside the point -- the talks are highly likely to set off extreme, sustained market moves because sentiment has become so sensitive to the trade war. Considering that, the potential scenarios could be roughly delineated as follows: Trade talks break down and the trade war escalates No concrete steps, but positive sounds and more talks planned Agreement on tariffs announced, but IP/tech issues go onto a separate track for longer-term talks Agreement announced on both tariffs and IP The first scenario will be the easiest for traders to react to.",HOG,en,Zero Hedge

2019-01-29 07:55:18-05:00,HOG Gets Slaughtered After Harley Reports Biggest Miss In Ten Years,"The stock of America's iconic motorcycle maker, Harley Davidson, is in full-blown slaughter mode this morning, after the company reported dismal earnings, barely breaking even in the last quarter of a year in which HOG got caught up in President Donald Trump’s trade wars. Harley-Davidson fell over 8% pre-market after the company reported 4Q EPS and revenue that not only missed the lowest Wall Street estimates, but were the biggest miss to consensus since 2009. GAAP EPS was $0.000 in the fourth quarter, and 17 cents a share on a non-GAAP basis which excluded tariffs and restructuring costs (somehow excluding tariffs is now part of non-GAAP), missing analysts’ average estimate for 29 cents (range of 19c to 42c) while revenue was only $955.6 million, far below the consensus estimate $1.05 billion (range $1 billion to $1.10 billion, while 4Q gross margin 27.6% was modestly better than the estimated 27.5%. The company also reported 4Q motorcycle shipments of 43,489, down 7.9%, which fell well short of the company’s forecast given in Oct. for total shipments of 45,800-50,800.",HOG,en,Zero Hedge
