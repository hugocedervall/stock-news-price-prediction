2020-04-13 13:55:14-05:00,Massive OPEC+ Cuts Not Enough To Derail Tanker Earnings,"Never before has oil production been slashed this much this quickly, but it still isn't enough to offset coronavirus demand destruction. OPEC and cooperating non-OPEC countries such as Russia (a coalition known as OPEC+) will cut output by 9.7 million barrels/day (b/d) in May-June, 7.7 million b/d in July-December and 5.8 million b/d in January-April 2021. Coronavirus demand destruction is estimated to exceed 20 million b/d. Continued excess production will pull more tankers into use as floating storage, reducing the number of vessels bidding for spot voyage deals and prolonging historically high rates. ""In any other time, an output cut of this magnitude would be the death knell for the tanker industry,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Jon Chappell. ""But with the reductions failing to match the estimated demand destruction, inventories are still likely to build materially … pressuring near-term oil prices and incenting floating storage. ""Tanker stocks are the only place for energy capital before the demand/supply imbalance inflects,"" maintained Chappell.",INSW,en,Benzinga Feeds

2020-04-03 16:07:30-05:00,Roller-Coaster Ride Continues For Crude-Tanker Stocks,"It was all setting up so nicely for crude-tanker stocks until those Trump tweets on Thursday morning … Shares of companies that own very large crude carriers (VLCCs; tankers that carry 2 million barrels of crude) had been climbing steadily since early March, pulled upward by spot rates of over $200,000 per day and expectations for a spike in floating-storage contracts. Then, like a roller coaster that rumbles over the top of the slope and gathers speed on the other side, the stocks came back down. At 10:30 a.m. Thursday, the U.S. president tweeted that Saudi Arabia and Russia would cut production by 10 million barrels per day (b/d), then: ""Could be as high as 15 … GREAT news for everyone!"" Actually, not everyone. Reduced output equates to fewer VLCC cargoes and less future storage. Merely talking about production cuts can immediately incentivize tanker owners to accept lower rates. Between the tweets and Friday's closing bell, crude pricing rose 30% and VLCC stocks went in the opposite direction, despite the fact that VLCC spot rates still exceed $220,000 per day: DHT Holdings, Inc.

2020-03-16 17:24:42-05:00,Crude-Tanker Stocks Plunge As Rates Hit Record Highs,"It is the best of times; it is the worst of times. Just as spot freight rates for supertankers have reached epic new heights, crude-tanker stocks are plummeting. Rates for very large crude carriers (VLCCs; tankers that carry 2 million barrels of crude oil) have in some cases topped $300,000 per day, driven by demand from Saudi oil shipping company Bahri. ""Although we are certainly at very high levels, the market could continue to go higher in the short term,"" asserted Frode Mørkedal, managing director of research at Clarksons Platou Securities. He believes the current VLCC market is ""much stronger"" than the market in October 2019, when rates previously spiked. Some analysts believe publicly listed VLCC owners are an ideal hedge and safe haven during the coronavirus-induced stock-market crash. Alas, they were not a haven Monday, at the very time record-setting VLCC employment contracts were finalized.

2020-03-06 08:52:00-05:00,How OPEC's Coronavirus Cuts Affect Ocean Shipping,"The market expected a new coronavirus-induced 1 million-barrel-per-day (b/d) production cut from OPEC+, the coalition of OPEC and participating non-OPEC nations. What it got on Thursday was a much bigger proposed cut of 1.5 million b/d. Underscoring the severity of the demand problem, crude prices fell by 2% on Thursday despite the OPEC news. How do escalating crude-oil production cuts affect ocean shipping? It depends on the sector. Crude-Tanker Demand There are those who believe OPEC cuts are a plus for crude tankers because such reductions are replaced by U.S. exports to Asia, which travel longer distances and soak up more capacity. That is the minority view, however. ""The global crude-tanker market is around 40 million b/d, so the impact of a 1.5 million-b/d cut — 4% of seaborne volumes — is especially challenging for crude-tanker names,"" said Stifel analyst Ben Nolan. ""The OPEC cut is a negative,"" echoed Jefferies analyst Randy Giveans. U.S. crude exports are indeed very strong. According to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the U.S. exported a record 3 million b/d in full-year 2019 — 3.7 million b/d in the month of December.",INSW,en,Benzinga Feeds
