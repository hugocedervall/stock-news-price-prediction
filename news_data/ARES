At the time, the retailer was able to work out a deal with bondholders that allowed it to preserve its cash while it tried to survive the disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic. But analysts expected more restructuring down the road, and in recent weeks media reports had pointed to an inevitable bankruptcy filing. On Saturday, the clock for Guitar Center, which began in 1959 as a store selling home organs in Hollywood, finally ran out when the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as music lovers moved their shopping online during the coronavirus pandemic. As part of a pre-packaged bankruptcy filing the retailer negotiated to have a total of $375 million in debtor-in-possession financing from its existing lenders and announced its intention to raise $335 million in new senior secured notes, the company said in a statement .",ARES,en,Zero Hedge
