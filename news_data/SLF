Fifty years on and the Editor has kindly allowed me to pen three articles – looking at the past, the present and the future – with a particular eye on the SIPP market. I would list the dominant influencing features during my career as: technology, complexity, (inconsistent) government policy, (increasing) longevity and the evolution of Financial Planning. When I started at Sun Life retirement benefit calculations were performed manually on a Monroe Calculator which are now museum pieces. Alacrity and dexterity in the use of a Monroe were KPIs as much as accuracy – all data and calculations were recorded on cards. The mainframe computer occupied a whole floor of the building and temperature control was crucial to prevent major interruptions.

2020-08-18 04:36:00-05:00,3 factors to lead to bank stocks going up again,"As the lead indicators start showing an uptick in the next six months, the banking sector will start to perform better, says CEO, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMCWhen do you think banking stocks will start moving higher because there is a technical overhang, there is an economy overhang and there is an NPA concern?We are doing some kind of analysis with respect to the profit contribution to the Nifty versus the market contribution. The profit contribution coming from the banking sector which owns about 33% of the index is only about 22%. So, that has dropped significantly. Naturally the market cap of these companies in the last one, two, three years got destroyed because profit contribution did not keep pace with increase in the market cap. The market got corrected as a result of that. But having said that, the banking sector is a proxy to the economy. When we see the economic growth to be negative, the banking and financial sector will tend to underperform. When you see the uptick that could come as you see economic growth coming back, the lead indicator would be credit growth.",SLF,en,Economic Times India

While term insurance products may become as much as 30% dearer, medical insurance premiums may rise by 20-25%.

Medical and morbidity-related risk calculations are undergoing revaluations at global reinsurance level, multiple industry sources aware of the matter said.As per industry executives, the hike in reinsurance rates for the industry can be anywhere between 300 and 400 basis points over the current 8-9%.
