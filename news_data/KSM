2020-01-08 08:04:39-05:00,HubTran Earns Spot On 2020 FreightTech 25 List,"Transportation companies big and small share the common dread of dealing with their back offices. While most would understandably rather focus on the front-end of the business, HubTran is dedicated entirely to automating and streamlining the critically important processes that function behind the scenes.

The company states it can reduce back-office work by up to 80% for brokers, third-party logistics providers (3PLs) and forwarders. In November, HubTran earned the No. 22 spot on the 2020 FreightTech 25 list announced at FreightWaves LIVE in Chicago. The awards recognized the companies considered the most innovative and disruptive in freight today. One-hundred companies were nominated; the FreightTech 100 was winnowed to the top 25, and those were judged and ranked by an expert external panel with voting conducted by accounting firm Katz, Sapper & Miller (KSM).",KSM,en,Benzinga Feeds
