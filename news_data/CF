If approved, the move could solve one of the biggest pain points preventing institutional investors from pouring billions into the US cannabis industry. Cannabis remains federally illegal in the US, though that hasn't stopped investors and banks from strategizing around the booming industry. One of the biggest pain points preventing multibillion-dollar institutions from investing in the US cannabis industry may soon be solved.

A custodian bank holds stock and settles trades for funds that invest in publicly traded stocks. Think of them like the plumbing that allows investors to safely buy stock in public companies. Cannabis industry sources speculate that the bank, which is already very active working with cannabis companies, will use the FINRA approval to act as a middleman between big asset managers like Fidelity, JP Morgan, and BlackRock and Canadian Securities Exchange-listed US marijuana companies like Curaleaf and Green Thumb Industries.",CF,en,Business Insider
