As digital channels become a more critical part of the overall banking journey, banks' design teams need to strategize on how best to create user experiences (UX) that resonate with their customers. A strong UX enables banks to deliver a simple, intuitive, and frictionless digital banking experience. A superior UX can also help banks improve customer satisfaction and bring in new customers. Offering a wide range of in-demand mobile banking features, for example, can satisfy existing customers and drive bank selection among new ones — but only if these features are designed and implemented well: JD Power found that customer satisfaction was negatively impacted across both online and mobile channels by the flood of complex and hard to understand features that are common in banking apps today, per an analysis from its 2019 customer satisfaction ratings.",BAC,en,Business Insider

And while December is not the best performing month on average (that would be July), December is the month when the market is up the most on average. As BofA chief technician Stephen Suttmeier writes, seasonality back to 1928 suggests that December is the month of the year that the SPX is most likely to be up: December is up 74% of the time with an average return of 1.3% (1.5% median). And although December has already rallied 1.8% MTD as of Dec 8, seasonality suggests that December ' s strength is back-end-loaded.

BofA CIO Michael Hartnett showed further evidence of the rampant stock mania citing the latest EPFR fund flow data which shows nothing short of a ""buying bonanaza"", with flows in the latest week as follows: $17.5bn into equities, $6.4bn into bonds, $2.2bn out of gold, $2.9bn out of cash. Extending the lookback period to the post-Pfizer announcement on Nov 9 shows a remarkable surge in bullish sentiment over the past three weeks as follows: Record inflow to equities of $89.0bn (prior high was Jan'18 ) Record inflow to EM debt & equity of $28.0bn (prior high was Jan'18) 2nd largest inflow ever to value stocks of $7.6bn (all-time high was Dec'19) 4th largest inflow ever to small cap stocks of $9.9bn (in past 4 weeks, all-time high was Jun'18 - Chart 5).",BAC,en,Zero Hedge

As we've noted (see: here & here ) , traders, analysts, and bankers are set to experience a flat to a slump in bonus payouts this year despite an explosion in trading and debt & equity underwriting. The message from within Bank of America, according to Bloomberg sources, is that senior executives are likely to keep the bonus pool for sales and trading desks at last year's level, despite a solid year in revenue, jumping more than 20% in the first three quarters of the year. BofA's top leadership is mulling over large bonuses because the virus pandemic has wreaked havoc over its consumer division department and added expenses. Sources said some staff who expected to receive large bonuses for stellar performance are outraged.

The assistant will then provide answers or carry out the requested actions. As Chase iterates on its Digital Assistant, it should follow the lead of Bank of America (BofA), which has molded its Erica virtual assistant to address current customer needs. Bucking the trend of weak interest, Erica has seen significant uptake: It counts 15.9 million users as of Q3 2020, up from 14.4 million in Q2.

If you have an American Express card, you may see Amex Offers for cash back on wine purchases, or for bonus points on food delivery. See Business Insider's list of the best rewards credit cards. In the scheme of things, not being able to fully maximize your rewards credit cards during the coronavirus pandemic isn't the biggest problem.

The elite Wall Street bank announced its 2020 partner class on Thursday — and seven of the 19 investment bankers elevated to partner status came from the bank's technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) group. On the whole, Goldman elevated 60 people to partner status, which brings the total number of partners at the elite Wall Street firm to fewer than 440, a reduction in the historical partner class size, which reflects CEO David Solomon's efforts to tighten the pool on the partner class and make it more exclusive.

2020-11-13 08:24:00-05:00,Loans under deferral at the biggest US banks more than halved in Q3,"Summary List Placement Loans under deferral at the biggest four US banks plunged from $190 billion in June to $90 billion as of September 30, but it is uncertain whether they will continue declining in the coming months, according to Financial Times analysis of regulatory filings. The Q3 decline owes to consumers and businesses resuming payments as the economy began to reopen and social distancing measures eased in many regions. But spiking coronavirus infection rates across the US have raised concerns that the dip in deferrals could only be temporary. US banks pulled back on loan loss provisions across the board in Q3, suggesting confidence in customers' improving financial situations—but gauging the level of risk they face remains a challenge. Bank of America (BofA), Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and JPMorgan Chase have taken more than $62 billion in charges in total for future loan losses this year, largely in the first two quarters, per the FT. They tapered back their allocations in Q3, as more customers exited deferral programs and resumed regular payments: BofA, for example, set aside $1.39 billion for loan losses in Q3, far lower than the $5.12 billion it allocated in Q2.",BAC,en,Business Insider

The firms’ execs explain what’s at stake.,"Summary List Placement The relationship between banks and fintechs is complicated. Once seen as scrappy disruptors, fintechs have established themselves as a serious threat. For a majority of Americans, these consumer apps have become a key part of their financial lives. From peer-to-peer transfers to new forms of credit and no-fee bank accounts, fintechs run the gamut of personal-finance products. But the startup revolution hasn't occurred entirely independently. Fintechs still need banks, or at the very least, the data stored inside them. With many of their customers maintaining accounts at traditional financial firms, fintechs need to be able to connect and share information with their much larger peers. That's where companies like Plaid and Envestnet's Yodlee come in. These data aggregators sit in the middle, connecting third-party apps to various banks' systems.

JPMorgan Chase, for example, is already investing in quantum computing despite the tech being years away from robust commercial use and Bank of America and Nasdaq were well into their cloud migrations before this year, only to have the projects validated by the coronavirus pandemic. HSBC also expanded its cloud investments during the outbreak. While others remain skeptical out of fear of housing sensitive client data in public servers, among other concerns, those that did make the investments may have had an easier time pivoting after the pandemic forced them to require employees to work from home — including call center workers . Amazon Web Services managing director Scott Mullins said that the pandemic has also created a record-breaking volume of trading for its Wall Street customers, which AWS supported through enabling them to quickly scale their services to ""peak processing demands at a moment's notice."" Nasdaq, for example, tapped AWS to reduce the amount of time it took to bill clients at the end of the day from 40 minutes to four minutes — a particularly beneficial improvement when factoring in the increased trading volume over the past few months, according to Mullins.",BAC,en,Business Insider

Wall Street trading powerhouses Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs capitalised on a flurry of activity in financial markets as clients bought and sold stocks in response to the coronavirus pandemic while many companies went public or raised fresh capital. In contrast, banks with retail focus like Citigroup and Bank of America struggled due to historically low interest rates, provisions to cover bad loans and lower consumer spending. Morgan Stanley’s net income applicable to common shareholders rose to US$2.60 billion (RM10.8 billion) in the quarter ended Sept 30, from US$2.06 billion a year ago.

But in a positive sign that BofA is expecting better times ahead for its consumer lending business, it set aside $1.39 billion for loan losses, which is far lower than the $5.12 billion it set aside in Q2 2020. Digital and mobile consumer banking user growth YoY slowed relative to last quarter, but BofA's continued digital investments appear to be paying off in terms of driving engagement. Digital (mobile and/or desktop) banking users grew just 3% YoY to reach 39.3 million, versus 5% YoY in Q2 2020 . And mobile users grew 7% YoY to 30.6 million, versus 9% YoY last quarter.

Unlike BofA's disappointing sales and trading results, Goldman reported revenues and EPS which smashed expectations, with Q3 revenues of $10.78BN, up 30% Y/Y, and smashing exp. $9.40, resulting in Q3 EPS of $9.68, double the $4.79 reported a year ago, and also trouncing the estimate of $5.52. Some more highlights on how Goldman generated more than $10BN in revenue: Investment Banking generated quarterly net revenues of $1.97 billion, including the second highest quarterly net revenues in Equity underwriting.

The bank reported that in Q3, revenues tumbled by 11% to $20.3BN, down from $22.8BN a year ago, pressured ""by low interest rates"", and missing estimates of $20.8BN. This resulted in Net Income of $4.9BN and adjusted EPS of $0.51, also well below last year's $5.8BN and $0.56, respectively, but slightly stronger than the $0.49 expected. According to the bank's presentation, these were the key revenue and net income highlights: Revenue of $20.3B declined 11%, driven by lower net interest income and noninterest income Net interest income of $10.1B ($10.2B FTE 1), down 7% from Q2, driven primarily by lower interest rates as well as lower loan levels Sales and Trading revenue of $3.2B and Investment Banking fees of $1.8B, declined from robust 2Q20 levels Noninterest expense of $14.4B increased $1.0B, or 7%, driven by elevated litigation expense, higher net COVID-19 expenses, and the addition of merchant services expenses Provision expense of $1.4B declined $3.7B Included a $0.4B net reserve build in allowance for credit losses; Net charge-offs of $1.0B were down $0.2B However, as noted above and just like yesterday, there was just one thing investors were looking at, and that's the bank's loan loss provisions.",BAC,en,Zero Hedge

In other words, for the first time in its history, JPM had 100% more deposits than loans, or inversely, the ratio of loans to deposits dropped below 50% for the first time ever: A similar, if not quite as acute pattern emerged at Citigroup, where deposits similarly hit a new all time high, even as the bank's loans have been virtually unchanged for the past decade.

How much time can automated underwriting save? How are lenders benefitting from underwriting automation? Below, we tackle these questions and take a look at what the future of automated mortgage underwriting may look like. What is automated mortgage underwriting? Automated mortgage underwriting is the process where advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technology electronically undertakes the decision making process for granting mortgage loans.

That level would be a record high for the S&P 500, and it is 4% above Friday's levels. However, before you take that cheery aspect of Hartnett's forecast and run with it, consider why he definitively calls it the ""top."" The 3,600 level on Hartnett's radar is the upper end of a 3,300-3,600 band he had expected the S&P 500 to trade in between August and January 2021. And so far, his forecast is playing out . To understand why he's expecting a top in stocks, it's worth walking through the reasons he highlights for why the market will continue ascending in its ""final melt-up."" He anticipates that during the fourth quarter, investors will preemptively price in the successful passage of additional fiscal stimulus for the pandemic-stricken economy.

And while the projected debt number stunned the market, it barely registered on the price or yield of US Treasurys for the simple reason that just weeks earlier the Fed announced it would monetize all gross debt issuance for the US when it unveiled Unlimited QE , something it has been doing since. This massive surge in debt issuance would also result in a far higher Treasury cash balance which would be used to pre-fund various fiscal stimulus programs, and as the chart below shows, that's precisely what happened with the Treasury cash balance exploding from $400BN at the end of March to an record high just above $1.7 trillion currently, an amount that is just waiting to be spent as soon as Congress gives the green light.",BAC,en,Zero Hedge

An estimated $350 trillion worth of outstanding loans and trading contracts around the world are based on LIBOR. What is LIBOR? Somewhat like the US federal funds rate , LIBOR is an interbank rate: It reflects the interest that major banks charge each other when borrowing for brief periods — anywhere from overnight to 12 months.

Virtually all hydrogen is still made from fossil fuels. And hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles — which don't generate tailpipe emissions — represent just a fraction of the transportation sector. But analysts at Bank of America say that's about to change. ""We believe we are reaching the point of harnessing the element that comprises 90% of the universe, effectively and economically,"" the bank said in a report this month. The hydrogen economy is on track to generate annual revenues of $2.5 trillion by 2050, the bank said, citing the Hydrogen Council , an industry group. The total indirect infrastructure investment, including for fuel-cell equipment, could be as high as $11 trillion by 2050, the bank said.

The most perfect example of this repression: the US fiscal deficit soared from 7% to 40% of GDP in Q2’20… ... and less than one month later the volatility of US Treasury market fell close to all-time low. Besides volatility, central bank repression works its magic on yields: case in point Italian & Greek 10-year government bonds which are down to 1%, while US Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities (CMBS) & IG corporate bonds down to 2%, meanwhile the 30-year US mortgage rate just dropped to a record all time low of 3%.",BAC,en,Zero Hedge

For the past two years, crypto-media outlets and Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocates have placed heavy emphasis on the need for institutional investors to embrace the cryptocurrency sector. The oft-stated belief was that institutional inflow would lead to mass adoption and an incredible spike in the value of crypto-assets as a whole. Fast forward to the present, and the total cryptocurrency market capitalization has yet to reach the $750 billion all-time high seen in late 2017. The slow recovery of crypto prices raises a few hard to answer questions. If institutional funds have been flowing into cryptocurrencies, why hasn’t there been a significant price increase over the last three years? Either there is an almost infinite sell pressure — which shouldn’t be a barrier considering the total crypto market cap is just $248 billion — or this theory that institutional investment will pump crypto prices does not hold.",BAC,en,Cointelegraph

In sectors, earnings were hit hard in energy, capital goods, autos, travel, financials, and healthcare providers. On the other side, earnings held in relatively well in staples, utilities, and real estate. Looking ahead, BofA expects earnings to contract 30% on the Y/Y scale in Q2, before beginning to recover gradually from there. That's about as far as any forecasts will go, as visibility for earnings growth a year from now is virtually nonexistent, however for some bizarre reason, bottom-up consensus numbers are showing a +15% growth for Q1 2021 Y/Y, and it's unclear where this growth will come from.

And since the Fed ""is not buying stocks yet and likely only would if pressed by new lows"", this was and remains a bear rally. As both we and Bowler have discussed previously, while bear market rallies are incredibly common, quick recoveries from high levels of stress coupled with record fast drops in the VIX are unprecedented. As such, according to Bowler if history is a guide it would not be unlikely for the S&P to rally near 3000 before rolling over and returning to lows, given 1) the size of this shock, and 2) the fact it is coinciding with a recession. In fact, as the BofA trader notes, "" if the recent S&P peak on April 29th holds, it would start to look quite textbook."" Of course, the bull-case is that this time is different due to still light positioning and the unprecedented $12 trillion so in stimulus ""which could further divorce asset prices from economic reality.""

If high profits do not attract competition, there is something wrong with the system, and it is not functioning properly.” – Jeremy Grantham At that time, the impending recession, and consumption freeze, was only starting and we had no data to suggest just how bad it was going to get. Since then, we have had epic declines in manufacturing, surging unemployment, and plunging retail sales. To wit: “From the decline of 8.7% in retail sales, 40% of PCE, we can extrapolate the decline into expectations for PCE growth. Again, since PCE comprises almost 70% of the economy, this is why expectations are for a drop of 10%, or more, in GDP in the second quarter.” But it isn’t just retail sales.",BAC,en,Zero Hedge

Amid falling interest rates, mortgage volumes have been soaring since the second half of 2019. That went into overdrive this week after the Federal Reserve announced a surprise, emergency cut to its benchmark interest rate in the face of the growing global coronavirus outbreak. Following the rate cut, JPMorgan Chase's call centers and digital channels were flooded with mortgage-related inquiries, leading the bank this week to dial back its marketing spend. In contrast, Bank of America isn't shifting home-equity staff — because it extensively trained hundreds of them on mortgage underwriting in 2019 to give the bank more flexibility. Experts say rates heightened demand will continue as rates fall further, and that could mean long wait times to close on homes and refinancings. Visit BI Prime for more stories .

Specifically, the ""deflation"" assets, such as bonds, credit, growth stocks (315%), have massively outperformed inflation assets, e.g., commodities, cash, banks, value stocks (249%) since QE1. At the same time, US equities (269%) have massively outperformed non-US equities (106%) since launch of QE1."" And, as happens every time the Fed tries to manage asset prices, it had blown another bubble: commenting on the hyperinflation in risk assets, Hartnett said that the ""lowest interest rates in 5,000 years have guaranteed a melt-up trade in risk assets"", which the strategist had called the Icarus Trade since late 2015, noting that the latest, ""e-Commerce"" bubble, which consists of AMZN, NFLX, GOOG, TWTR, EBAY, FB, is up 617% since the financial crisis, making it the 3rd largest bubble of the past 40 years."" Fast forward two years, one failed attempt at normalizing interest rates, one QE4, and one historic P/E multiple expansion meltup later, when the same bull market leadership in ""growth"" assets has led to the unprecedented result that the top 5 stocks now account for a greater share of S&P500 market cap than ever before … ... and when what in 2018 was the third largest bubble of all time only has - thanks to 800 rate cuts by central banks since the Lehman bankruptcy - now been rebranded to "" e-Commerce"" by BofA's Hartnett, and which as shown in the chart below has - after rising more than 1,000% from its crisis lows - become the single biggest asset bubble of all time .",BAC,en,Zero Hedge

Investment-focused tech startups ""mainly had their heyday in the mid 2010s and learned some hard lessons along the way,"" the Deloitte Center for Financial Services said in a report published Wednesday. ""As a result, many have shifted to a business-to-business (B2B) model, merged with incumbents, or simply disappeared."" Andy Sieg, the president of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management , told Business Insider that the unit is focused on investing in Merrill's existing technology and trying to ensure that its thousands of financial advisers are incorporating the full menu of tech into their practices. That thinking highlights how standalone robo-advice and wealth-tech firms may be in a tricky spot as legacy firms invest in their own technology.

If, for example, Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC ) transferred $10 million to Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC ), and Wells Fargo sent $10 million to HSBC (NYSE: HSBC ), these amounts would be aggregated and the ledger would only reflect the money travelling from Bank of America to HSBC, without any information as to the intermediate step. As the volume of economic activity grew, it became imperative to design a financial messaging protocol that would facilitate the transfer of money or securities in real-time.

This is because we leave the 2010s stuck in an economic regime characterized by low growth and low inflation. Real GDP has averaged just 2% in the US, 1% in the EU and Japan, and halved from 12% to 6% in China as the world's most populous nation rebalances towards a consumer rather than export-led economy.

As BofA notes in a recent report, ""the combination of globalization, lower interest rates and a policy and macro backdrop of maximum liquidity and minimal growth have served to exacerbate wealth inequality, and create a surplus of global savings relative to investment, i.e. extremely low ""animal spirits"".

2019-12-10 10:12:07-05:00,Technology Stocks Could Be In Focus Today As Trade Dominates The Headlines,"If you woke up this morning to see some premarket jitters, it might have been due to a report by the South China Morning Post stating it’s increasingly unlikely that a U.S.-China deal will get done this week as U.S. officials focus on a trade pact between the United States, Mexico, and Canada. But a subsequent report by The Wall Street Journal said the two nations are working on a possible delay of the Dec. 15 tariffs. Equity index futures erased early losses to move into the green by the opening bell. A postponement or cancelation of those duties would likely please stock market participants, at least if the two sides can’t reach an interim deal before then. The world’s two largest economies have been trying to hammer out a deal for some time now, and uncertainty surrounding the trade situation has been the biggest headwind facing Wall Street. But recently, excitement about a partial trade deal getting done soon has helped push the market to record highs. In November, optimism around trade, as well as better-than-expected earnings helped spur TD Ameritrade clients to increase exposure to the market and end the month as net buyers of equities, according to the Investor Movement Index ® (IMXSM).",BAC,en,Benzinga Feeds

To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here. The Federal Reserve Board has announced that it is working on a service, dubbed ""FedNow,"" that will enable all US banks to offer real-time payments 24/7, TechCrunch reports . The Federal Reserve's board of governors voted to support the approval of FedNow in a 4-1 verdict on Friday. The system is expected to be operational by 2023 or 2024 and will initially support transfers of up to $25,000. While smaller community banks and credit unions are applauding FedNow, it's meeting resistance from large banks. Smaller banks are enthused about universal access to real-time payments, as it will enable them to offer faster and more convenient services, such as faster check cashing and peer-to-peer (P2P) payments to all customers, regardless of whether or not they work with a service like Venmo or Zelle. However, FedNow will also put the Fed at odds with some of the biggest banks in the world — including Wells Fargo, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, among others — that collaboratively own The Clearing House (TCH), which previously launched a system reducing processing times from a few days to under five seconds, per a senior vice president at the company cited by The Washington Post.",BAC,en,Business Insider

The firm cited trade-war uncertainty between the US and China and a lack of normalization in interest rates as reasons. Emerging markets in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East are holding up amidst global trade woes and should see meager improvements in 2020, BAML says. Bank of America Merrill Lynch lowered its expectations for global gross domestic product growth on Friday, blaming trade-war uncertainties and lagging policy responses for its weakened outlook. The firm slashed its predicted global GDP forecast to 3.3% from 3.6%. BAML already lowered its 2019 forecast from the 3.9% level it proposed in November. The report cited several reasons for the negative adjustment. The first is the continued trade war between China, which BAML global economist Ethan Harris said is ""already lowering growth in much of the world."" ""The obvious story is that policy uncertainty shocks — primarily the ever-evolving trade war — have start to have a notable negative impact on growth,"" Harris wrote in a note to clients. ""Trade has stopped growing; indeed, this is the weakest stretch since the Great Recession."" The chart below backs up this assertion: In the event that a final trade-war truce is reached, BAML still has concerns over the other geopolitical turmoil Trump has created during his time in office. ""Even if there is a deal, we worry about the US' long trade war to-do list, including potential currency intervention and tariffs on other countries and products,"" Harris said.",BAC,en,Business Insider

Some banking apps allow you to turn off your debit card, but you should still contact the bank to get a replacement card if your card is missing. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. If your debit card is lost or stolen, you'll want to cancel it ASAP. That's because the rules for debit cards and credit cards are not the same. While you're rarely liable for any fraudulent charges made on a credit card, your liability with a debit card depends on when you report the card missing; if the charges are made before you report it, you might end up being responsible for some or all of them — up to $50 if reported within two business days and up to $500 up to 60 calendar days.

China has decided to retaliate against the US' tariff hike from 10% to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese goods by taking $60 billion worth of US goods that previously had tariffs of 5-10% and placing those items into four new tariff groups: 25%, 20%, 10%, and 5%, The New York Times reports . Neither the US nor the Chinese tariffs will take effect in full immediately. The Trump administration declared that the US tariff hike will only apply to shipments that left China from last Friday onward, and the heightened Chinese tariffs won't take effect until June 1, giving the two countries a short period to come up with a deal.

Previously, cannabis was viewed as a taboo drug because of its psychoactive nature. However, many countries around the world are now beginning to acknowledge the medical benefits associated with the plant. For instance, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first-ever cannabis-based drug, Epidiolex, last year to treat childhood epilepsy. Moreover, a cluster of other countries have also realized the benefits of cannabis and have since moved to adopt medicinal legislation of their own. The rapid growth of the industry has even led a handful of companies to list on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Exchange, the two largest exchanges in the world.

It has created the right synergy, achieved scale and resulted in better shareholder value creation. It would be wrong to think that this move of GoI was in response to the difficult conditions that many PSBs find themselves in. Nor was it meant to provide protection to a ‘weak’ bank like Dena Bank (as it is perceived to be). This amalgamation is the result of a deliberated choice in the present world economy.It is incongruous for the world’s sixth-largest economy by GDP in 2018 to not have a bank ranked in the world’s top 25 by size; China has six. The UK, whom we will overtake to become the fifth-largest economy this year, has three. Canada, the 10thlargest economy, has two, and Spain ranked 13th has one.

Writer Erica Lamberg has learned the hard way that the most important perk for a good travel credit card is no foreign transaction fees.

Wertheim, 79, is a self-made billionaire worth $2.3 billion, according to Forbes ' The World's Billionaires list. His fortune comes from numerous inventions and buy-and-hold investing. Wertheim could very well be the most significant individual investor many Americans have never heard of, and he recently sat down with Forbes to prove it. Madeline Berg, a reporter at Forbes following the money, flipped through Wertheim's brokerage statements which showed hundreds of millions of dollars in tech stocks like Apple and Microsoft, purchased long ago at their IPOs. There are dozens of other blue-chip stocks in the portfolio, ranging from GE, Google, BP, and Bank of America. Here is Wertheim's interesting path into becoming a billionaire. In the early 1960s, he attended the Southern College of Optometry and after graduation started a small practice in South Florida.

Here Is Goldman's Answer,"On Friday, we reported that with more than 65% of Europe's public companies having reported results, historical Q4 European EPS growth stands at -1% year-on-year, the lowest since Q2 2016 and down from 8% for the full Q3 earnings season. This, as Deutsche Bank observed, is a material 3% disappointment relative to consensus expectations for the companies that have reported so far and the largest negative surprise in four years. Just as bad, the breadth of ""earnings beat"" surprises, at 45%, is at the lowest level since at least 2010 and is below the long-run average of 54%. What is even worse, however, is that as of this moment consensus expects European companies to post no growth in the first quarter, a number that is certain to deteriorate over the next few weeks, and indicating that Europe will almost certainly see two consecutive quarters of declining corporate profits, the definition of an earnings recession.

2019-02-23 19:40:00-05:00,China's Premier Slams Central Bank For Gargantuan Credit Injection,"Last week many traders were dumbfounded when, just as speculation was building that China was preparing to unleash a massive credit expansion a la Shanghai Accord, Beijing confirmed that it had indeed decided to massively reflate its (and the global) economy, in what may soon be dubbed the Shanghai Accord 2.0, when the PBOC announced it had flooded the economy with a gargantuan 4.64 trillion yuan in various new forms of debt which comprise China's Total Social Financing in January, including notably, the ""shadow"" credit which Beijing had been aggressively cracking down on: an aggressive credit expansion which many took as a tacit confirmation that China was losing the fight with deleveraging. As the following chart from BofA's Michael Hartnett shows, which puts China's latest credit expansion in historical context, January's debt tsunami was vastly greater than China's credit expansion during both the global financial crisis and the Shanghai Accord. And while analysts, economists and markets cheered this unprecedented credit generosity by Beijing, which appeared to once again throw in the towel on deleveraging after a similar attempt sent overnight rates soaring five years ago and nearly blew up the local banking system, expecting that China will henceforth inject even more debt which in turn will spark an inflationary impulse across the globe and prop up both economies and markets (it's hardly a surprise that Chinese stocks have soared in the past few weeks), it appears that January's gargantuan credit boost may end up being a one off event, because while China's credit injection amounting to over 5% of GDP was welcome by global market, it also resulted in a rare public spat between Chinese premier Li Keqiang and the central bank, after he expressed concern about record credit expansion in January, a result of monetary stimulus intended to support flagging economic growth.",BAC,en,Zero Hedge

So while technicals will surely be a major hurdle to overcome, there is a case that sends the S&P back to its all time highs around 2,950. According to BofA chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett, while catalysts for the S&P move from 2350 to 2750 were bearish positioning and panicking policy makers, the catalysts for fresh upside to new highs would be ""green shoots"" & ""greed"" even as few see EPS acceleration, while most think the Fed is ""pushing-on-a-string."" To make it easier for the bulls, Hartnett then lays out an indicative ""green shoots"" checklist for EPS emerging from the upcoming earnings recession, would include the following items: US 2s10s yield curve steepens to 50bps from 16bps, Asia export growth up 7% YoY from -2%, global PMI up above 53.0 from 50.7 (Feb survey data poor), China financial conditions index (CHBGMCI) up to 95 from 84, which as we noted previously is already taking place thanks to a gargantuan credit impulse/injection which saw China's Total Social Financing explode in January to the tune of over 5% of GDP.",BAC,en,Zero Hedge

In fact, as BofA notes, the Fed's forecasting accuracy is on par with that of market consensus, in other words rather dismal, and swayed more by the market than underlying fundamentals . To assess the Fed's forecasting record, BofA looked at two sets of forecasts: the Board of Governors staff forecasts (Greenbooks) and the FOMC's summary of economic projections (SEP); whereas the academic literature has focused on the former, BofA examines the SEP forecasts from 2009 to the present.

This was confirmed by the latest Fund Managers' Survey from BofA, which found that the allocation to global equities tumbled 12% to just net 6% overweight in February, the lowest level since September 2016, and the biggest MoM drop relative to the performance of global equities (+7% from Jan 4th start of Jan'19 survey) to Feb 7th (end of Feb'19 survey) on record.

Buffett continued to bid up bank shares, making his Omaha-based firm a major shareholder in four of the five largest US banks.

After posting its worst GDP print in years, Germany’s economy was bolstered by domestic demand in the fourth quarter, as investment into buildings and equipment rose markedly. Also, in delight to fiscal doves everywhere, government spending increased significantly from the previous quarter, while private consumption was up fractionally. However, with exports and imports rising at roughly the same pace, there was no contribution from net trade, which is a problem for an economy that relies greatly on trade to grow its economy.

Matteo Salvini, the outspoken head of the anti-immigrant League party, said the Bank of Italy and Consob, the country’s stock market regulator, should be "" reduced to zero, more than changing one or two people, reduced to zero"", or in other words eliminated, and that “fraudsters” who inflicted losses on Italian savers should ""end up in prison for a long time.""

And while the future of corporate profits is increasingly nebulous - despite the Q1 EPS decline consensus still expects Q2-Q4 to post earnings growth leading to another full year of rising EPS - problems are emerging amid already reported earnings. Here are the facts: with 73% of S&P500 companies having now reported earnings, so far, 60% of companies have beaten on EPS, 53% on sales and 37% on both. While this is not only below the long-term average, it is also the lowest at this point of earnings season in four years. Commenting on earnings, BofA notes that it expected fewer and lower beats this quarter vs. recent quarters, given the deterioration in economic data surprises/the fall in the ISM indices in 4Q, plus weaker results from the early reporters. And that's precisely what has taken place: as BofA's Chart of the Day shows, the ""Era of big beats has come to an end"" and Q4 has seen the weakest quarter for actual results relative to expectations since Q2 2011. 4Q sales are coming in 0.6% below start-of-January levels, and suggest sales growth of +5% YoY (vs +9% in 3Q).",BAC,en,Zero Hedge

Looking at Jim Reid's favorite economic indicator, the yield curve, following the Fed’s U-turn the probability of an inversion has fallen or at least when it occurs might have been delayed according to the DB strategist, who then looks at the only notable ""false positive"" in the 70-year series of yield curve inversions as a precursor to recessions, which took place in the late 1960s where the first inversion happened around 48 months before the recession, ""breaking"" with the 3-year max interval between curve inversion and recession. And yet there is a reason for this false positive: what happened in the 1960s is that in the face of rising inflation but a falling stock market, the Fed made what has since been described as a ""policy error"" by keeping policy too loose especially in the face of higher government spending on the Vietnam War and on the start of Medicare/Medicaid.",BAC,en,Zero Hedge

Meanwhile, even as Net Interest Income continued to grow... ... one can argue that the bank's strong bottom line performance has been mostly a function of aggressive stock repurchases. Going back to the 4th quarter, and looking at what did well, BofA is quick to note that it saw a 4% increase in total average deposits to a record high $1.345TN, driven by a 9% increase in Global Banking deposits.",BAC,en,Zero Hedge
