Over the last decade, companies selling razors, mattresses, clothing, luggage, dog food, and pretty much anything else you can think of, have built their entire brand ethos around the proximity of their product to the consumer. With this proximity came a value proposition: selling their products directly to consumers enabled higher quality products to be sold at lower prices than the ""traditional"" brands that are purchased by and distributed by retailers. Buying a razor from the shelves of your local Target was tired, buying them from Harry's website was wired. So why is it that recently some of the original DTC disruptors have been popping up in the very place they initially decried — the store?

David Palatnik, the owner of MNG 2005 Inc., initially filed the suit two years ago against Visa, along with JPMorgan Chase, its subsidiary Paymentech LLC, and G2 Web Services. The suit alleges that Visa withheld $66,000 in payments, fined MNG $25,000, and cut off transactions involving the business after wrongly determining that it was involved in illegal activities. The defendants had filed several motions to have the claims dismissed, but U.S. District Judge John A. Ross ruled Monday that the CBD chain can sue Visa for unjust enrichment and defamation. He dismissed antitrust claims, however, and ruled that a contract between MNG and Chase and Paymentech limits MNG to just breach of contract claims against those companies.",CVS,en,Benzinga

Here's how it would work, if approved: After purchasing a ticket for a concert, fans would need to verify that they have already been vaccinated ( which would provide approximately one year of COVID-19 protection [ ZH: really ?] ) or test negative for coronavirus approximately 24 to 72 hours prior to the concert.",CVS,en,Zero Hedge

Demand for toilet paper has been so high during the pandemic that in order to keep their shelves stocked, retailers are buying up foreign toilet paper brands, mostly from Mexico. Major chains, across the country, including CVS, Piggly Wiggly, Safeway, 7-Eleven and others, are carrying the international brands. In recent weeks, a CVS in New York has been selling three Mexican brands: Regio, Hoteles Elite and Daisy Soft. Mexico's Petalo was on the shelves of a Piggly Wiggly in Sister Bay, Wisconsin. And a Safeway supermarket in Fremont, California, had those same brands, plus Vogue, whose label says in Spanish that it smells like chamomile. The stores said they needed to get creative during the pandemic and started working with new suppliers to get shoppers what they needed. But don't worry about popular U.S. brands like Charmin - they aren't going to disappear. Supply chain experts expect the Mexican and other foreign-made rolls to be on store shelves only temporarily, until U.S. manufacturers catch up with demand.",CVS,en,Connecticut Post

There is no doubt that investors are living in an upside down world. A speculative frenzy fueled by extreme monetary policy is sending stock markets to all-time highs and bond yields and spreads to record lows. At the same time, a global recession is raging, and social unrest is worsening by the day. We shouldn’t forget a pandemic is still having a significant effect on our lives. Maybe investors are just an optimistic bunch and able to look beyond the current problems. However, it could be that investors are again falling victim to greed and cannot see the forest for the trees. More bluntly, maybe they cannot see the risks for the hope. Another consideration is that desperate times call for desperate measures.",CVS,en,Zero Hedge

Why would it? After going nearly straight up for the last five months, it’s only natural for there to be a pullback. This was particularly true for technology stocks. They’d reached such dizzying heights it was just a matter of time before the thin air got to them. And get to them it did. Some of the mania’s favorites, like Apple, Tesla, and Nvida, fainted in unison…dropping 8 percent, 9 percent, and 9.3 percent, respectively. A company called PagerDuty garnered the honor of the day’s biggest loser. The San Francisco based company, which operates in the cloud, made a graceful 25.8 percent swan dive from its heavenly realm. So, what should you do about it? Should you buy the dip? As far as we can tell, there’s currently no fundamental reason to buy stocks.

In the aftermath of George Floyd’s death, peaceful protests were held in more than 300 cities all across America, and a recent CNN poll found that 84 percent of all Americans supported those peaceful protests. Unfortunately, rioting, looting and violence also erupted in major cities from coast to coast, and very little was done to suppress that violence. As a result, the core areas of many of our largest cities now resemble war zones, and in the months ahead there will be a constant threat that the violence could flare up again at any time.

Authored by John Whitehead via The Rutherford Institute, Cash may well become a casualty of the COVID-19 pandemic… As these COVID-19 lockdowns drag out, more and more individuals and businesses are going cashless (for convenience and in a so-called effort to avoid spreading coronavirus germs), engaging in online commerce or using digital forms of currency (bank cards, digital wallets, etc.). As a result, physical cash is no longer king. Yet there are other, more devious, reasons for this re-engineering of society away from physical cash: a cashless society—easily monitored, controlled, manipulated, weaponized and locked down—would play right into the hands of the government (and its corporate partners). To this end, the government and its corporate partners-in-crime have been waging a subtle war on cash for some time now. What is this war on cash? It’s a concerted campaign to shift consumers towards a digital mode of commerce that can easily be monitored, tracked, tabulated, mined for data, hacked, hijacked and confiscated when convenient.",CVS,en,Zero Hedge

Last year, online pharmacy PillPack was on track to more than triple its annual revenue to surpass $1 billion by 2020 — just two years after being acquired by Amazon for $750 million — according to a pitch deck reported in CNBC. Amazon wasn't the only one eyeing PillPack: Retail giant Walmart — which has also been inching into the healthcare space — was considering acquiring the startup as well. PillPack was on the up and up with big firms mulling acquisitions to unlocking its potential, which begs the question: Why did PillPack settle on the $750-million-dollar deal — and will the deal pay off for Amazon? Here's what it means: Prior to its acquisition, PillPack was feeling the heat of squeezing into a market crowded with high-flying incumbents. PillPack was slammed with steep costs when it was ramping up efforts to crack into the industry.",CVS,en,Business Insider

According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 41 states have so far set up cultivation and production programs to regulate the production of hemp. Cowen, an investment bank and financial services company, noted that in 2018, CBD retail sales were between USD 600 Million and USD 2 Billion . By 2025, Cowen projects that CBD sales will reach the USD 16 Billion mark. Major corporations such as CVS, Walgreens, Amazon, and Sephora have all began to distribute CBD products in their stores.

2019-05-09 03:00:04-05:00,The Corporate World Has Its Own Inequality Problem,"(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- Liberals have a blind spot about inequality. They decry disparity between individuals—the fact, for example, that the 10 richest people in America have more money than the bottom 160 million. But they overlook inequality among companies, instead viewing Big Business as a troublesome monolith. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont occasionally tarred business with a broad brush, once saying the chiefs of large multinational companies “ain’t going to like me.” The surprising truth is there’s as much inequality among large companies as there is among people. As with individuals, a handful of companies make the lion’s share of profits, while struggling companies do so poorly they actually destroy value for their shareholders and debtholders. In the middle is a stressed-out majority: unable to keep up with the best, while pressured by the desperate tactics of the worst. Inequality in the corporate world isn’t new. Perfect competition—with millions of small, roughly equal businesses battling it out on a level playing field—was never more than a teaching device in intro economics textbooks.","DAL,CVS",en,Bloomberg

2019-04-25 09:43:00-05:00,"Anthem is prepping to roll out its pharmacy benefit manager after a strong Q1 (ANTM, CI, AMZN)","This is an excerpt from a story delivered exclusively to Business Insider Intelligence Digital Health Briefing subscribers. To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here . US insurer Anthem reported an impressive $24 billion in operating revenue in Q1 2019, up 9% year-over-year (YoY) from $22 billion in 2018, thanks to the addition of over 1 million new members. Anthem's revenue hike comes as the payer gears up to launch a proprietary primary benefit manager (PBM), dubbed IngenioRx . The payer will start transferring members to its PBM at the beginning of May, per Forbes. For context, PBMs are the middlemen of the pharmaceutical industry, responsible for negotiating the costs of drugs for health plans. Here's what it means: Anthem's move into the PBM market could be lucrative — and its sheer size could be a massive aid in kicking off the initiative. The US PBM market is worth around $423 billion , offering Anthem a ripe revenue opportunity. And as the second largest US insurer — Anthem counted nearly 41 million members as of Q1 2019 — Anthem has ample traffic to funnel through IngenioRx, which could help get its fledgling PBM off the ground.",CVS,en,Business Insider

2019-02-22 11:42:44-05:00,These Are The 50 Most Popular Hedge Fund Longs And Shorts,"After a dreadful year for professional (carbon-based) money managers, when in 2018 the average hedge fund posted the worst return since 2011, equity hedge funds have had a strong start to 2019, returning 6% YTD. Although far from discovering some new source of alpha, according to Goldman's analysis of the latest batch of 13F filings, the recent strong hedge fund returns have benefited from the outperformance of the most popular long positions as well as the decision to increase net length ahead of the equity market bottom in December 2018. Furthermore, the relative performance of Goldman's Hedge Fund VIP basket and hedge fund net long exposure each bottomed in the days before the S&P 500 reached its low on December 24. So far in 2019, the VIP basket, which tracks the most popular long positions, has returned +14%, outperforming both the S&P 500 (+11%) and Goldman's basket of the largest short positions (GSTHVISP, +7%), which is to be expected in light of the massive short squeeze that has taken place in the past 9 weeks.","CVX,CVS",en,Zero Hedge
