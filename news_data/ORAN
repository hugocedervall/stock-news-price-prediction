2019-06-06 07:47:00-05:00,"What the LTE-M roaming pact means for telecoms and customers (T, KPN, ORAN, SCMWY)","LTE-M IoT devices will function when traveling between Europe and North America, thanks to a roaming agreement between international telecoms AT&T, KPN, Swisscom, and Orange. The agreement will initially only cover networks in the US, Mexico, the Netherlands, France, Romania, and Switzerland, but will expand to at least four additional European countries by the end of 2019. LTE-M networks are well suited for a range of low-bandwidth IoT use cases, such as smart meters and location tracking, as well as connected street lights and smart appliances. And by using an LTE-M network, which require little power, devices' batteries can last for as long as 10 years without replacement, according to GSMA. Here's how this agreement will benefit the participating telecoms: LTE-M roaming presents a new revenue opportunity for telecoms, as it allows them to offer enterprise clients a wider array of low-power asset tracking and connectivity products that work in more markets. By opening more LTE-M networks to IoT devices, the telecoms participating in this agreement have effectively increased the number of available use cases for those networks — and the number of devices and services they can sell.","ORA,ORAN",en,Business Insider

In remarks that touched a nerve for the US, Huawei Chairman Guo Ping offered what Bloomberg described as ""his boldest defense yet"" against allegations that Huawei is complicit in espionage during a presentation in Barcelona, where he also brought up the NSA domestic mass-surveillance programs exposed by former contractor Edward Snowden. Many of these programs - like the infamous PRISM program - involved the mandatory cooperation of the US's biggest tech and telecoms firms in the collection of digital communications. Guo pointed out that US federal law requires companies to hand over data to the government, even when that data is stored on foreign servers.","ORA,ORAN",en,Zero Hedge
