LME copper stocks surged 67 percent over Thursday and Friday to 186,425 tonnes after hovering at decade-lows for the first half of this month. But supply concerns for some metals, including copper, could widen the market deficit, ANZ wrote in a note. ""This leaves little room for replenishing depleted inventories."" Production at MMG Ltd's Las Bambas copper deposit in Peru could fall ""in the near term"" due to a month-long road blockade, the company said last week. ""Underlying demand has been resilient, as reflected in Chinese imports,"" which for unwrought copper and copper concentrate combined were up 12.4 percent year-on-year in January-February, ANZ added. FUNDAMENTALS * COPPER: Three-month LME copper ticked up 0.3 percent to $6,451 a tonne by 0517 GMT, after closing up 0.4 percent in the previous session.
