This is further evidence that we could be heading into a long-term and perhaps irreversible decline in gold mine production. According to the World Gold Council, total gold mine output in 2019 came in at 3,463.7 tons. A particularly weak fourth quarter drove the overall decline in gold production. Mine output fell 2% year-on-year in Q4 to 859.5 tons. According to the WGC, it was the lowest level of fourth-quarter mine output since Q4 2016. Gold production declined year-on-year in every quarter of 2019. Although last year marked the first absolute decline in gold production since 2008, it continues a general trend of falling mine output. Gold mine production was up a modest 77.72 tons between 2015 and 2016, 33.92 tons between 2016 and 2017, and 28 tons between 2017 and 2018.
