Sam Randazzo, chair of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO), announced his resignation Friday.

On Thursday, FirstEnergy disclosed a $4 million payment in 2019 to terminate a consulting agreement with “an entity associated with an individual who subsequently was appointed to a full-time role as an Ohio government official directly involved in regulating” FirstEnergy’s Ohio distribution utilities.

2020-11-11 12:01:00-05:00,FirstEnergy’s Carbon-Reduction Pledge Lacks Clear Path to Cutting Coal Use,"Ohio-based utility FirstEnergy is following the example of an increasing number of U.S. utilities in promising to reduce its carbon footprint to zero by 2050. But its reliance on its own coal-fired power plants in a region with relatively low levels of renewable energy could make that goal even more challenging than it’s expected to be for other U.S. utilities that are making similar pledges . And the Akron, Ohio-based utility holding company’s new pledge doesn’t clarify how it will take on the challenge of ending its use of coal-fired power. FirstEnergy’s climate strategy released Monday notes that the utility will “need to move beyond” the coal-fired power that now makes up about four-fifths of the generation capacity under its control. But its target for exiting coal “by 2050 or earlier” provides little guidance on how this will play a part in reaching its 2030 goal of cutting emissions by 30 percent from 2019 levels. Much of the rest of its strategy pertains to grid investments and efficiency improvements for its transmission subsidiaries and its 10 electric distribution companies serving about 6 million customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland and New York.",FE,en,Green Technology Media
