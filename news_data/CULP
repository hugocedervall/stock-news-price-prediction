It takes 450 hours to assemble. It reportedly costs between $17,100 and $36,500. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . If you were freaked out by the above press photo just now, don't worry. Rolls-Royce hasn't suddenly hired a team of white-gloved giants to pose with its cars. What it has done, rather, is made a 1:8-scale replica of its Cullinan SUV. The 1:8-scale Cullinan isn't a toy. You're a goose for even thinking so. It is even ""far more than a mere model,"" the official Rolls-Royce press release states. The little Cullinan is an authentic replica of the full-sized thing. Rolls-Royce says every detail has been perfectly recreated by hand and tailored to the customer's personal preferences. It's made from more than 1,000 individual pieces. Putting the whole thing together can take up to 450 hours — which, as Rolls-Royce points out, is over half the amount of time needed to build a regular Cullinan.",CULP,en,Business Insider
