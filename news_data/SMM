2020-09-29 22:25:09-05:00,"Singapore’s Keppel identifies $13b assets for monetisation, shares rise","SINGAPORE : Singaporean conglomerate Keppel Corp said it had identified assets worth S$17.5 billion ($12.8 billion) for monetisation, including through sales, and started a review of its lossmaking offshore and marine (O&M) business. Its shares, which have been languishing near a decade low, rose as much as 6.5% in early trade. The plans unveiled on Tuesday are part of Keppel’s 10-year strategy flagged earlier this year to refocus its portfolio on energy and environment, urban development, connectivity and asset management. Keppel said it was exploring options including strategic mergers and disposals for its offshore and marine business, which builds oil rigs and has been battered by falling energy prices. Keppel said the assets, such as some of its landbank and investment properties, it has identified to potentially monetise over time have a total value of about S$17.5 billion. “Over the next three years, we plan to monetise about S$3-S$5 billion of the assets from this substantial S$17.5 billion base to seize new opportunities that can help us achieve our desired returns,“ CEO Loh Chin Hua said.",SMM,en,The Sun Daily
2020-09-17 19:00:00-05:00,How COVID-19 Is Transforming The World's Sovereign Wealth Funds,"How COVID-19 Is Transforming The World's Sovereign Wealth Funds Tyler Durden Thu, 09/17/2020 - 20:00 Authored by Oxford Business Group via SafeHaven.com, The IMF predicts that the global economy will contract by 4.9% this year, down from growth of 2.9% in 2019, while the World Bank has forecast a fall of 5.2%, the worst contraction since the Second World War. With national economies suffering from revenue shortages, and populations in need of additional government support to mitigate the impacts of the crisis, SWFs have in many cases seen their roles transformed. As a result of reduced income, many governments have been tapping SWFs to help balance budgets and provide stimulus to businesses or households. This development has changed the conventional wisdom surrounding SWFs, which have combined assets estimated of around $6trn globally. Before the pandemic the funds were seen as having limited – or a total lack of – liabilities. However, Covid-19 has seen SWFs called on to meet the implicit liabilities associated with economic shocks.",SMM,en,Zero Hedge
