More than 300 brands have entered Growpacker’s pipeline in less than two years. As Growpacker plans to go public, CEO Stephen Boyd spoke with Benzinga about the company he founded in 2017. “We previously owned a tea company producing and marketing beverage products while working with other co-packers. I started thinking that 90% of products are co-packed somewhere, so why would the cannabis industry be any different?” he said. “So, we took the proceeds and experience from the tea company and put them toward Growpacker.” This transition to a new family of plants did not deter Boyd, who said he utilized the lessons he learned from marketing black tea with green tea. “Realistically, it comes down to learning how to reverse-engineer the MSRP of a product and what margins, distribution and retail might look like."" With tea, Boyd said he had to come with formulations for the cost of ingredients, which came in varying measurements.",BYD,en,Benzinga
