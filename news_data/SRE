2019-08-08 12:41:53-05:00,"Expert Take On PG&E Equity Offering, Bankruptcy Outlook","PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG ) shares jumped 4% Thursday following a new filing that revealed shareholders have agreed to a $15 billion offering to help the company pay for its reorganization efforts. PG&E stock has had a rollercoaster year as investors try to navigate the company’s massive potential liabilities for recent California wildfires and its complex bankruptcy proceedings. California’s Plan The stock had dropped 74% to under $7 per share in three months when the company officially filed for bankruptcy Jan. 29. Since that filing, the stock has actually gained 34% as the state of California has pushed new legislation that would reset the relationship between utility companies like PG&E and the state moving forward. The wildfire law currently on the table in California would require PG&E, Edison International (NYSE: EIX ) and Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE ) to spend a combined $5 billion improving equipment safety. In addition, the three companies will pay a combined $7.5 billion up front and another $300 million each over the next 10 years to create a California wildfire insurance fund.",SRE,en,Benzinga

The SPDR Utilities Select Sector ETF shed 1.0% in afternoon trade, with 27 of 28 equity components losing ground. The biggest decliner was NRG Energy Inc.'s stock which slumped 5.1%. Among other more active utilities ETF components, shares of AES Corp. lost 2.3%, Excelon Corp. gave up 0.9% and Southern Co. shed 0.6%. The lone gainer was Sempra Energy's stock which tacked on 0.6%. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose 3.6 basis points to 2.484%, after falling 10.4 basis points the previous three sessions, as a bounce in the stock market helped calm risk-off trades. Utilities stocks tend to have relatively high dividend yields, so a rise in yields on low-risk Treasurys make them less attractive. The utilities ETF's dividend yield is 3.15%, compared with the implied yield for the S&P 500 of 1.99%, according to FactSet.",SRE,en,MarketWatch

2019-02-10 19:00:00-05:00,California's Two Remaining Utilities Are One Fire Away From Bankruptcy,"Two weeks after California's largest utility PG&E filed for bankruptcy protection (marking its second bankruptcy in 20 years), Bloomberg is sounding the alarm that California's two other large electric utilities are just one wildfire away from bankruptcy filings of their own - a fact that was underscored last month when S&P slashed their credit ratings to near-junk status. And to the chagrin of California residents, Gov. Gavin Newsom has done nothing to ease these anxieties, leaving large swaths of the largest state in the union without solvent utility companies (a situation that would likely lead to massive rate hikes on California's already heavily taxed consumers). The two utilities in question are Edison International’s Southern California Edison Co. and Sempra Energy’s San Diego Gas & Electric Co. Both utilities have begged California lawmakers to reconsider the state's view on the legal concept of inverse condemnation. Put simply, this legal principle allows utilities to be held liable for any wildfires caused by their equipment - even if the utilities have followed every safety rule.",SRE,en,Zero Hedge
