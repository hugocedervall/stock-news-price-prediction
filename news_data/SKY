2020-07-21 16:00:05-05:00,The Rise of the Murdoch Dynasty review – Succession with phone hacking and foam pies,"The second instalment of this three-part series covers the scandal that left Rupert ‘humbled’ – and nearly destroyed his UK newspaper business At the beginning of part two of The Rise of the Murdoch Dynasty (BBC Two), the question of succession seems to have been parked, if not settled. In 2003, Rupert Murdoch’s youngest son, James, is installed as chair of the satellite broadcaster BSkyB. Accusations of nepotism dog the appointment – James’s main qualification seems to be his surname, his main talent finding ways to tell reporters he is too busy to talk to them – but an heir has apparently been found. A few years later, elsewhere in the empire, another star is rising: in 2009, the editor of the Sun, Rebekah Wade, marries the racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks . The wedding reception, attended by Murdoch and various top politicians eager to curry favour, has the romantic atmosphere of the lunch break at an arms fair. Before the year is out, Wade – now Brooks – will become CEO of News International.",SKY,en,The Guardian
2020-07-14 17:30:00-05:00,How Rupert Murdoch turned a small Australian newspaper into a global media empire — and built a family dynasty worth $17 billion,"Australian-born billionaire Rupert Murdoch, 89, helms a media empire made up of newspapers like The Wall Street Journal , television networks like Fox News , and a handful of other publications across the world. A new three-part documentary on Murdoch's life and influence debuted on BBC Two this week. Murdoch inherited his very first newspaper from his father, who was a war reporter turned publisher. Bloomberg estimates his individual net worth to be $6.34 billion as of July 13, while Forbes pegs the Murdoch family's collective fortune at $17 billion. Following Disney's $71 billion purchase of 21st Century Fox assets, Murdoch distributed $12 billion in proceeds to his six children. In December 2019, Murdoch's son Lachlan purchased Chartwell , a historic Bel-Air estate, for $150 million. The purchase set a California record and is the third-priciest home sale ever recorded in the US. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories .

2020-06-15 17:05:34-05:00,"What Will macOS 10.16 Be Called: Mammoth, Monterey, Skyline, or Something New?","Every year heading into WWDC, one question on many Mac fans' minds is what Apple will choose as the name for the next version of macOS. The tradition dates all the way back to the beginning of Mac OS X with its big cat names, and then in 2013 Apple shifted to Calfornia-themed names with the unveiling of OS X Mavericks. Back in the early days after the debut of OS X Mavericks, we discovered a total of over 20 California-themed trademark applications filed by various limited liability companies that were all but certain to be shell companies created by Apple to hide its identity. Over time, some of the trademarks like Yosemite, Sierra, and Mojave were indeed used by Apple for its major Mac operating system updates, while trademark applications for many of the other names have been abandoned. In last year's lead-up to WWDC 2019, we noted that of that original set of trademark applications, only four unused ones remained active: Mammoth, Monterey, Rincon, and Skyline . All four of those trademarks had been granted by the U.S.",SKY,en,Mac Rumors
