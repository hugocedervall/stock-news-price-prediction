What’s interesting as the country’s momentous day begins is that the “horsemen of risk” aren’t really charging out of the gate. Gold is up a little, but bonds and volatility are both lower and Monday’s stock market rally continued overnight. The relaxed approach so far might reflect widespread market belief that once the election is over, fiscal stimulus hopes could reignite. The market is basically saying that whoever gets in, it will be comfortable, and that the winner—whoever it is—is likely to spend money. Though Wall Street is rallying now, it’s gone up and down a lot lately, so there’s no guarantee of early strength lasting. Volume has been thin lately and remains that way, and when volume is low it’s easier to push things around. It’s unlikely, though, that we’ll see people step in and take a big stand right here ahead of the election.

Fake plants and flowers have become increasingly realistic looking and they can be a solid no-maintenance way to add greenery to your space without any hassle. Several major retailers and boutiques sell artificial plants, including Target , Wayfair , Pottery Barn , The Sill , and more. It's possible to have green decor flair without an ounce of high maintenance care. If you, like me, frequently buy plants to liven up your space with the best of intentions, only to have them die a few months later, perhaps it's time to embrace the faux plant trend. Over the years I've invested in beautiful fresh orchids, low-maintenance snake plants and succulents, and even ambitiously tried out ferns and monstera plants. Despite my efforts at giving them proper sunlight, water, and tender care, they have all died. Some lasted a few months while others managed to thrive for a couple of years, but in the end, they all bit the dust.",W,en,Business Insider

To answer their question, Goldman has put together a real-time reopening scale which, since no fundamental or economic data matter, will soon become the top market-moving indicator for the US stock market. * * * One month ago, when most of the US was still behind the curve on the first wave of the corona pandemic, Goldman published a ""lockdown index"" to keep track of where on the spectrum, so to speak, various US states and country in general were to be found. One month later, the usefulness of this index appears to have peaked as markets now only care about the ""reopening"" - at least until the second coronavirus infection wave hits - and as cities and states across the U.S. begin to reverse lockdown measures at different paces and with different processes in place, Goldman has introduced a new index and weekly series that will measure the pace this reopening is happening by looking at a wide range of data from “Stay at Home” (food delivery, eCommerce, streaming media, grocery sales, etc.) to “Back to Normal” (commuting, box office, travel, etc.) and business activity (freight, housing, equipment sales, etc).","VZ,W",en,Zero Hedge

This time around, it’s gotten so popular that the bidding for slices of distressed companies can resemble a heated takeover battle, with as many as 20 private equity firms clamoring for a piece of one deal.The fever underscores the huge amount of money buyout shops are sitting on -- some $1.5 trillion, compared to $615 billion a decade ago -- and the dwindling number of traditional buyouts available.
