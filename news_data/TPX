2019-05-13 08:00:00-05:00,Cannabis Legalization Persists as a Topic of Discussion all Over the World,"NEW YORK , May 13, 2019 /PRNewswire/ --The rapid proliferation of cannabis legalization throughout the North American region has led to the emergence of new products within the recreational and medical marketplaces alike. Aside from smoking cannabis through joints or pipes, consumers are now enjoying cannabis in a variety of ways, including edibles and extracts. Consequently, the shift towards different cannabis-based products led to a major decline in flower sales. For instance, Colorado began adult-use sales back in 2014 and flower sales accounted for 67% of the state's total revenue. However, four years later in 2018, flower sales sank and accounted for only 44%. During the same period, the concentrates market closed the gap, as its market share expanded from 15% to 31%, according to BDS Analytics. Now, the declining flower sales don't necessarily mean the cannabis market is retracting, rather, it signifies the emergence of innovation within the industry. On the other hand, segments such as the hemp market have made significant progress over the past year.",TPX,en,Benzinga
