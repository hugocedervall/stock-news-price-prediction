El intento de los Estados Unidos, que cobró fuerza el mes pasado, sigue a una ofensiva similar para tratar de excluir al gigante chino de equipos de telecomunicaciones Huawei Technologies de las redes de telecomunicaciones, pero que ha dado resultados mixtos. Como en el caso de Huawei, la campaña contra Nuctech se ha convertido en un test sobre la capacidad de los EEUU de persuadir a sus aliados para que no contraten a un proveedor de equipos más económico, justificando esas presiones en la preocupación de EEUU por la seguridad, unas preocupaciones que las compañías aseguran que son injustificadas.",CHA,es,El Confidencial

Huawei was placed on a trade blacklist last year over national security concerns and Washington has led an international campaign to convinces allies to exclude Huawei when setting up their 5G networks. The Pentagon putting these companies on the list doesn't trigger penalties per se, but its part of a 1999 law that says the president may impose sanctions, which could include blocking all the companies' property.
