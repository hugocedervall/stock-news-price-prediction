2020-09-11 12:24:00-05:00,Out-of-home ad spending is becoming more digitally driven,"Summary List Placement This year, digital out-of-home (DOOH) ad spending will increase by 1.6%, and in 2021 it will rise by 19.2%. We expect DOOH ad spending to increase from $2.72 billion in 2020 to $3.84 billion in 2023. We define DOOH as any out-of-home (OOH) advertising that is dynamically and digitally displayed. It includes digital billboards, digital street furniture, digital transit and digital place-based display. We categorize DOOH as a subset of OOH, not as a subset of digital advertising, which means that our DOOH estimates are excluded from our digital advertising forecast. In 2020, DOOH will account for one-third of total US OOH ad spending. While that share might not seem impressive, consider that back in 2015, DOOH's share of total OOH was just 17.0%, about half of what it is today. By 2023, 42.0% of all US outdoor ad spending will come from DOOH. The number of outdoor displays that are digitized is growing quickly. From 2017 to 2019, the number of total digital displays in Outfront Media's US portfolio increased from 1,693 to 7,266, according to its financial fillings.",OUT,en,Business Insider

2020-04-27 09:58:23-05:00,Buffett-Goldman redux: Private equity firms fight for lifeline deals,"By Crystal Tse and Liana BakerWith buyouts at a virtual standstill, private equity firms are finding a new place to put their billions of dollars: investing in public companies that have been pummeled by the Covid-19 economic collapse.The technique is a throwback to the 2008 financial crisis when, in one notable deal, Warren Buffett threw a $5 billion lifeline to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. This time around, it’s gotten so popular that the bidding for slices of distressed companies can resemble a heated takeover battle, with as many as 20 private equity firms clamoring for a piece of one deal.The fever underscores the huge amount of money buyout shops are sitting on -- some $1.5 trillion, compared to $615 billion a decade ago -- and the dwindling number of traditional buyouts available. The firms are betting that struggling companies such as Cheesecake Factory Inc. and Expedia Group Inc. will recover once the economy opens up.Yet the competition for the deals has forced some firms to lower their typically high sights.",OUT,en,Economic Times India
