2019-02-20 06:46:47-05:00,Deutsche Bank Discussed Extending Trump Loan Maturity Over Default Fears,"Deutsche Bank's PR campaign to get out ahead of whatever "" Kerosene Maxine's"" subpoenas might uncover led to another not-altogether-unexpected revelation Wednesday morning when Bloomberg reported more details about the German lender's efforts to distance itself from the soon-to-be president. We reported previously that Deutsche sought to limit its exposure to Trump during the run-up to his 2016 electoral victory for two reasons: it feared the public blowback that any association with Trump's divisive campaign rhetoric might bring, and it also wanted to avoid the eventuality of Trump defaulting on a loan while in office - which would force the bank into the uncomfortable position of needing to seize the assets of the President of the United States. For these reasons, senior bank executives vetoed a request by the Trump Organization to expand a loan taken out by the Trump Organization (it wanted to use the extra money for renovations at Turnberry, one of its golf clubs). And now, BBG reported that the bank considered extending repayment dates for the Trump Organizations' outstanding loans until the end of a potential second term in 2025 to avoid the possibility of Trump defaulting while in office - a possibility that was discussed by members of Deutsche's management board, including then-CEO John Cryan.",LADR,en,Zero Hedge
