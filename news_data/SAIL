The company has the backing of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has set a goal to reduce the emissions intensity of the economy as well as curb the severe air pollution that chokes large swathes of the country’s urban landscape. Modi is pushing for a gas-based economy, where the fuel is seen more than doubling its share in the energy mix to 15% by 2030.“There is a lot of pressure on these industries because of climate change and we are offering them a solution to convert to gas,” Karnatak, who calls GAIL a “gas warrior,” said. “Oil use can’t be wiped out, and neither can be coal.",SAIL,en,The Economic Times India
