It would have a fully diluted market value of nearly $35 billion at the top end of the indicative range. That figure includes employee stock options as well as restricted share units.Airbnb’s highest valuation as a private company was $31 billion in a funding round in 2017. Warrants in an April round of debt and equity securities that included Silver Lake and Sixth Street Partners valued the company at only $18 billion, Bloomberg News has reported.The company’s IPO valuation and price range could still change depending on demand for its stock on its roadshow with investors over the next week or so.The company is currently planning to price its IPO on Dec. 9 and for its shares to begin trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market the following day, said a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private information.",OR,en,Yahoo Finance

The programme will establish a system of science-based nature targets to help companies play a role in preventing nature loss, which is devastating biodiversity and turbocharging climate change around the world. The targets would give businesses clearly defined pathways to ensure they are doing enough to build a zero carbon future, according to the SBT initiative, which has already worked with more than a thousand companies to set greenhouse gas emissions targets that are independently verified as being in line with the climate goals set out in the Paris Agreement. The body's new Corporate Engagement Programme aims to finalise the methods, tools, and guidance required to set similar science-based targets for protecting and enhancing nature. ""We are excited about working with companies to ensure our nature targets are as user-friendly and easy to implement as possible,"" said Erin Billman, executive director of the Science Based Targets Network.
