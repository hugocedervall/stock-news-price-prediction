Either through new listings on the NASDAQ, NYSE or with Depository Trust Company (DTC) eligibility, their stocks are just beginning to draw in bigger pools of investors. Cronos Group Inc. for example became the first cannabis company to list on the NASDAQ in early 2018. Aurora Cannabis Inc. debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in October 2018. Canopy Growth listed on the NYSE in 2018. Related companies are doing so, as investors become even more bullish. Analysts at Jefferies says the industry could reach $130 billion by 2029 , for example. ""This assumes full U.S. federal legalization, full recreational and medical legalization across Europe , full medical and recreational legalization across Lat Am, and cannabis disruption of a number of other industries,"" noted the analysts, as quoted by Yahoo Finance . ""Industries at risk of disruption are pharma, alcohol, health and wellness, pet care and smoking cessation."" Some of the top companies in the industry include High Tide Inc. (CSE: HITI ) (OTC: HITIF ), Green Growth Brands Inc. (CSE: GGB ) (OTC: GGBXF ), Westleaf Inc. (TSXV: WL ) (OTC: WSLFF ), Curaleaf Holdings Inc. (CSE: CURA ) (OTC: CURLF ), and Aphria Inc.
