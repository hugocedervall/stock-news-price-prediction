But now, as some Christmas shoppers are finding out, it also comes with some brand new negatives - including bots that have been tasked with buying up every new ""hot"" Christmas item as soon as it goes on sale online with major retailers. Such has been the case with items like the Playstation 5, which has been bought up on sites by bots that ""resellers use to snatch up products online and relist them moments later at significant mark-ups on eBay and Amazon Marketplace,"" according to Reuters . And with most people shopping from home this year, the total addressable market for online resellers has never been bigger. 26 year old Benjamin Karmis from Illinois, who has been trying for weeks to buy a Playstation 5, said: “There is no possible way that I could have been more prepared to get one, and I have failed every single time.” And it's not just Playstations the bots are looking to buy.",WMT,en,Zero Hedge

2020-12-05 08:00:00-05:00,"Why DTC brands, like Casper, Harry's, and Native, are selling their goods in the retail stores they sought to disrupt","Summary List Placement The term ""direct-to-consumer,"" by definition, means cutting out the middleman. Over the last decade, companies selling razors, mattresses, clothing, luggage, dog food, and pretty much anything else you can think of, have built their entire brand ethos around the proximity of their product to the consumer. With this proximity came a value proposition: selling their products directly to consumers enabled higher quality products to be sold at lower prices than the ""traditional"" brands that are purchased by and distributed by retailers. Buying a razor from the shelves of your local Target was tired, buying them from Harry's website was wired. So why is it that recently some of the original DTC disruptors have been popping up in the very place they initially decried — the store?

Die US-Regierung will Insidern zufolge dem chinesischen Technologiekonzern Bytedance keinen weiteren Aufschub für den Verkauf der Kurzvideo-Plattform TikTok geben. Präsident Donald Trump habe die Entscheidung bei Beratungen mit hochrangigen Mitarbeitern am Freitag getroffen, verlautete aus dem Umfeld des Treffens. Es werde aber erwartet, dass die Verhandlungen weitergingen. Das Präsidialamt und TikTok wollten sich nicht dazu äußern. Bytedance war in den vergangenen Wochen zwei Mal eine Fristverlängerung eingeräumt worden, die bisher letzte lief nun aus. Ein Vertreter des Finanzministeriums sagte, der Ausschuss für ausländische Investitionen in den USA (CFIUS) berate mit Bytedance über den Abschluss des Verkaufs und andere Schritte, die nötig seien, um die Risiken für die nationale Sicherheit zu beseitigen. Bytedance soll auf Trumps Druck das US-Geschäft von TikTok abgeben.

Still, industry experts and analysts say that the off-price sector is in a good position to beat out department stores during this festive period, despite clear digital and e-commerce advantages for chains like Macy's or JCPenney. Department stores have historically relied on the holidays for a sizeable portion of their revenue.

As of late September, fewer than one-third of US primary care practices said that patient volume was within 10% of what it was before the pandemic, per Primary CareCollaborative.

The payments firm recently announced that it reached 100 million monthly active users in October and processed 925 million transactions—helping it grab more than 40% of India's digital payments market.

One reseller group told Business Insider that it bought 3,500 consoles, and resellers said that they were selling $500 PlayStations for as much as $1,100. The consoles are such a hot commodity that they were the hot item on Black Friday , despite not being discounted at all.

2020-12-01 09:00:00-05:00,Thanksgiving weekend online sales reach new heights but miss expectations,"Summary List Placement Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday, and Small Business Saturday each saw an acceleration in online sales growth as consumers steered away from in-store shopping. Thanksgiving Day ecommerce sales grew 21.5% year over year (YoY), reaching $5.1 billion. The holiday missed ecommerce sales growth projections, which Adobe Analytics estimated would be 42.3% annually this year. However, Thanksgiving Day online sales still surpassed last year's, which capped off at $4.2 billion . With major retailers including Walmart and Target closed on Thanksgiving, more consumers took to online channels to make their purchases. But given that 76% of the top 50 retailers in North America were offering holiday deals on the Monday before Thanksgiving, it's possible that consumers may have spent earlier—contributing to online sales falling short on Thanksgiving Day. Online sales on Black Friday increased 21.6% YoY as in-store foot traffic plummeted . This year's $9.03 billion in Black Friday online sales grew relative to last year's $7.4 billion .",WMT,en,Business Insider

Here are 5 other established food brands that could be acquired next as companies look to put cash from coronavirus-driven sales to use.,"Summary List Placement There's a paradox today for big food companies: Many are reporting their best sales in years and piling up cash as consumers eat more at home — but using that cash to make acquisitions has become trickier than it was before COVID-19. Even as products like mac n' cheese, cold cuts, and other processed and shelf-stable foods fly off the shelves, experts say companies are likely to be cautious about taking on new operations through acquisitions. Though a few major food deals have closed in 2020, such as Mondelez's $1.2 billion purchase of Give and Go , which makes frozen baked goods that can be thawed before retailers and restaurants sell them, there have been fewer acquisitions of brands by big food companies since coronavirus shook consumer habits and financial markets starting this spring. With food companies striking fewer deals, many are accumulating cash. Candy maker Mars's spent a reported $5 billion acquiring Kind, which makes snack bars. The deal provides an example of what the world's largest food companies might be willing to buy.",WMT,en,Business Insider

Amazon dropped its average grocery prices by 2.3% during the third quarter, the steepest cut among leading US grocery retailers, according to data from research firm Profitero. The study, based on prices of more than 700 grocery products, found that Walmart had dropped its prices by 1.5%, while groceries at Target were 6.7% more expensive over the three-month period ended in September. Amazon's pricing strategy reflects the company's continued focus on growing share in the competitive grocery space by undercutting competitors. While Amazon is the largest e-commerce site in the US, it still lags far behind traditional retailers like Walmart, Kroger, and Target in the grocery market, as shoppers still prefer to touch and see the produce they buy. ""It reflects a commitment to the grocery category and to the overall value proposition to consumers that low prices are a fundamental reason to shop at Amazon, in addition to convenience and selection,"" Keith Anderson, Profitero's SVP of Strategy and Insights, told Business Insider.",WMT,en,Business Insider

Most companies don't disclose how much they spend on cloud services, but publicly traded firms will occasionally tell investors when they agree to multi-year deals committing to spending a minimum amount with a cloud provider.

The city has gone from 505 total cases up through Oct. 26 to 1,124 cases as of Monday. Mayor Skip Lee stressed to the council that he did not want to shut businesses down, but he has seen large groups as some businesses. He said that he feels the data is pushing the city to do more to stem the tide of coronavirus cases locally. ""Our hope is for compliance, not necessarily hammering anybody,"" Lee told the council. One of the mayor's concerns was that law enforcement could step in, but business owners did not necessarily have to comply. One idea floated at the meeting was that Lee could revoke a liquor license for a short period of time if a business did not comply. Alderman at Large John Stauter asked if this would apply to bars and not gaming facilities or restaurants. City attorney Tim Zollinger clarified that it would apply to any facility with a liquor license, which would include gaming facilities, but not include a restaurant which did not serve alcohol. ""I think the only way we're going to get their attention is to act in a serious way about it,"" Ward 2 Alderwoman Chris Wilen said. ""I have lost friends.",WMT,en,Sauk Valley Media

When COVID-19 first wreaked havoc on much of the world early this year, WMT was there to help as an essential retailer, dispensing everything from coveted toilet paper rolls to wine and spirits. And its first-half 2020 earnings bore that out. In-store and online sales rallied as WMT was one of the few big-box retailers ready with a robust online presence and the people power to handle the onslaught of lock down-related sales. Most analysts expect continued strength for Q3, but some wonder whether WMT’s results will be off the charts like they were in Q1 and Q2. Online sales in Q2 jumped 97%, and net income surged a jaw-dropping 80% to $6.48 billion. It might be tough to see a repeat performance quite like that when WMT reports early Tuesday. Guidance for Q4 could play a big role in how investors treat WMT shares following the earnings report. How’s That Walmart+ Working Out?",WMT,en,Benzinga

The same pattern seems to be forming early Monday as a week ago today, with stay-at-home stocks putting pressure on the Nasdaq 100 (NDX) even as other indices roar. Shares of MRNA rocketed 16% higher in pre-market trading even as Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ: ZM ) fell 6% and Peloton Interactive Inc (NASDAQ: PTON ) fell 4%.

As a result, when it comes to most prices in the electronics bucket, Amazon has some of the highest online prices now compared to such upstart online competitors as Walmart and Target , which are now in the unenviable position of having to undercut Amazon's prices to win market share. So is it indeed the case that Amazon's prices are now above its competitors? Not necessarily. This morning, Goldman published the takeaways from week 3 of its annual holiday pricing survey in which the bank captured the online prices of selected baskets of goods at WMT, TGT, AMZN, KR, ULTA, M, KSS, WSM, BBBY, JWN, DKS and Sephora as of November 10th.",WMT,en,Zero Hedge

Long before cloud computing was a thing, for instance, Ellison proselytized the premature notion of a network computer. Later he picked up a disgraced ex-computer hardware CEO, the late Mark Hurd , and made him an Oracle selling machine. Then there was the time a few years ago when Ellison seriously considered swapping a giant chunk of Oracle stock for SoftBank's stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. This never-before-reported gambit didn't see the light of the day because Oracle's board of directors squashed it. Given how much Alibaba's stock has outperformed Oracle's, it would have been a hell of a trade. But that's another story. All this talk of Ellison's bold if bizarre moves is highly relevant now because of Oracle's increasingly quixotic quest to grab a piece of TikTok, the Chinese-owned dance-video phenomenon beloved by youngsters of all ages.",WMT,en,Business Insider

Last week, the company filed for a 30-day extension with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the body responsible for approving a sale. But ByteDance claims the CFIUS hasn't responded to its request—so now the company has turned to the federal appeals court to grant an injunction allowing it to continue operations, per TechCrunch . This saga has been confusing and drawn out—here are some of our lingering questions: Didn't TikTok avoid a ban back in September with its Oracle deal? Yes and no. September 20 was the deadline for ByteDance to strike a deal to sell TikTok to a US company, which was met with the Oracle/Walmart deal.

ByteDance filed a petition in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on Tuesday night, requesting the court step in to prevent the Treasury Department’s forced sale.What TikTok is really asking for is more time.“We remain committed to working with the administration -- as we have all along -- to resolve the issues it has raised, but our legal challenge today is a protection to ensure these discussions can take place,” a TikTok spokeswoman said in a statement.",WMT,en,Yahoo Finance

Some may be stuck in pilot phases , unable to figure out how to expand initiatives across the enterprise. Others may run into cultural challenges, like overly-broad ambitions or a reluctance from middle-management to embrace change . And if you ask billionaire entrepreneur and C3.ai founder Tom Siebel, companies are floundering because they're trying to do it alone without tapping outside vendors like his own startup. As the CEO of a company that offers AI-backed software tailored to industries like oil and gas, banking, and manufacturing, Siebel has a first-hand view into companies' struggles, which he blames on the fact that corporations ""most frequently attempt to build the applications themselves with their own IT organization"" instead of enlisting outside help. ""Probably 99 out of 100 are failing and they're all internal build projects that involve sometimes hundreds of thousands of programmers,"" he said.

2020-11-05 09:14:00-05:00,How the pandemic will change 2020 holiday shopping behaviors,"Summary List Placement The ongoing crisis is set to change how consumers shop during the crucial holiday season, which is many retailers' biggest sales period, according to a study from Deloitte. Here's how the pandemic will damage holiday shopping: US consumers' finances and planned holiday spending took a hit this year in the wake of the crisis. Twenty-nine percent of respondents reported that their household's financial situation was somewhat or a lot worse than it was last year, up from 20% in 2019. And 38% said they plan to spend less during the holidays, far more than the 22% who said the same in 2019. The pandemic, which has caused unemployment to surge and created financial uncertainty for some consumers, is likely behind these declining financial situations and plans, cutting into merchants' sales opportunities over the holidays. Shoppers plan to limit their visits to stores now that the pandemic has made in-store shopping a potential health risk. More than half (51%) of respondents are anxious about shopping in-store over the holidays due to the crisis, leading 65% to prefer shopping online to avoid crowds.",WMT,en,Business Insider

According to the Yahoo News/YouGov survey , 51% of voters think Trump will refuse to concede if he loses the election while 77% “worry that violence will break out in the coming days.” Both sides are almost even when it comes to judging the reaction to either candidate winning. 59% of Trump supporters believe that if Trump loses it will be because “Democrats rigged the election,” while 58% of Biden supporters believe if the former Vice President loses it will be because “Republicans stole the election.” With that kind of sentiment being so dominant, it’s almost impossible that there won’t be some form of disorder in the days following the vote. Meanwhile, just 22% of registered voters expect to know the result on election night while only 28% believe the election will be “free and fair”.",WMT,en,Zero Hedge

How did so many miss their own serial treasons, in concert with the Soviet and Russian governments, dating back to 1917? Let us refresh our recollections of how so many Americans reframed history and disinformation. Some of the following may be ""lost history"" to you, but that is okay, because we definitely need some reminders before election day. FDR himself personally schmoozed Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs Maxim Litvinov in the White House and acknowledged the USSR diplomatically for no US advantage whatsoever in November of 1933.

Gold and silver were also getting shellacked. But it wasn’t all crash and burn. First Solar, Rolls-Royce Holdings, and CoreLogic all notched double digit gains.

And something else was up too… Most investors likely didn’t notice that American firearm manufacturer Sturm, Ruger & Company managed to eke out a small return. Why would they? A return of 0.43 percent is nothing to write home about. Nonetheless, we contend that Ruger’s modest gain in the face of a massive selloff is something that should get the attention of investors.

The Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express offers 6% back on your first $6,000 in US supermarket spending each year (then 1% back), which makes it easy to maximize one of the most common spending categories. Beyond that, it offers 6% cash back on select US streaming services, and 3% back on US gas stations and transit. The card does come with a $95 (waived the first year if you apply by 12/10/2020) annual fee, but we feel the fee is well worth it. Why? The astronomical rewards you can earn if you take full advantage. Imagine you are the average family who spends a lot more than $6,000 per year (or $500 per month) at the supermarket.

But there's another component to transformations, too: reputation. Walmart, for example, is investing heavily in technology, both as part of its epic battle with Amazon for retail dominance and from a desire to be viewed as a software behemoth . The company works with a slew of outside vendors , but is developing many of applications in-house, as well — like its recent express delivery option . The overhaul is so robust that some Wall Street analysts believe Walmart's stock should be treated more like that of a tech company. In the case of Aventiv Technologies — the parent-firm of prison communications company Securus Technologies that's backed by billionaire Tom Gores — new CEO Dave Abel is relying on a digital overhaul to rebuild a tattered public image .

While brick-and-mortar shops have been forced to shut down during the COVID-19 pandemic, online retail has become the front and center of everyday lives. The pandemic-fueled demand for e-commerce has caused such an unprecedented strain on Amazon's warehouse, shipping, and logistics that it had to delay the typically July-held Prime Day to October. However, even in the midst of the pandemic lockdown, only 16.1% of US sales were online during the second quarter, a slight uptick from the 11.3% online sales at the end of 2019, according to the Census Bureau of the Department of Commerce . ""When you alert people that's how early we are in this transition, that gets their attention,"" said Hyman, the head of investment strategy at $44 billion ProShares ETFs.

A federal judge has scheduled a hearing for November 4, the day after the presidential election, to make a decision on whether the US government's ban of the viral video-sharing app can be implemented later in the month. The government's attempt at instating its first part of the ban is already being stymied by a temporary injunction granted last month, which the Trump administration appealed on Thursday. But the impending calendar date is still a month away, meaning there's ample time for TikTok and its Beijing-based owner ByteDance to make further moves to ensure the app's future in the US. The delay gives TikTok even further leeway as it grapples to survive in a months-long battle characterized by political jockeying and back-and-forth negotiations.

2020-10-08 09:35:00-05:00,Clover Health is going public in a $3.7 billion blank check deal,"Summary List Placement The insurtech is set to go public via a ""blank check"" deal worth $3.7 billion through which it'll merge with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), per MedCity News. For context, startups use SPACs as an avenue to the public market for a few reasons: These deals are often quicker due to a streamlined negotiation process and can be safer during periods of market volatility—which we're seeing amid the pandemic—because they're not contingent on raising capital through other investors. Clover Health plans to use the funds to fuel its expansion into new geographic markets—and we think the startup is on track to see a surge in users. The insurtech offers Medicare Advantage (MA) plans in 34 counties across seven states—and Clover Health CEO Vivek Garipalli recently said the startup plans to use the funds from its public debut to expand into 74 more counties and an eighth state in 2021, per MedCity News. Looking ahead to next year, investor Chamath Palihapitiya shared a document on Twitter indicating that Clover Health expects to have 273,000 members in 2021—a more than four-fold increase over its current base of nearly 57,000 enrollees, signalling a boom period may very well be on the horizon for the insurtech.",WMT,en,Business Insider

They think it's good for them. That candy — colorful, chewy, shaped like orange slices and teddy bears — is the gummy vitamin. Shmerling, who's been a rheumatologist in the Boston area for three decades and is a professor at Harvard Medical School, said some of his patients were taking a dozen supplements, gummy or otherwise, every day. ""Half of them, they're not even sure what it's for,"" he said. It's not the sugar in each vitamin that concerns him, although with an average of 3 grams a serving , it adds up. Rather, Shmerling thinks his patients should simply eat better. Instead of, say, buying a $55 pack of gummies made with blue algae, wheatgrass, barley, and other veggies, they should probably just eat their veggies. It's an amusing juxtaposition — adults who are health-conscious enough to care about their vitamin and mineral intake but don't mind starting their day off with candy.

Here's what that means for the red-hot payments space — and why big banks are worried.,"Summary List Placement Over the past decade, fintechs have become more than a niche group of disruptive startups out of Silicon Valley. Today, fintechs like Stripe and Square have achieved massive scale — and valuations — and are an essential part of the financial-services industry. But most fintechs aren't licensed banks, meaning they don't have a banking charter issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), one of the key regulators overseeing consumer banking. Instead, they are regulated and licensed at the state level, which means to operate nationally they have to work with 50 different regulatory bodies. That could soon change, however, as the OCC is mulling a charter aimed specifically at fintechs that process payments, allowing them to be regulated at a national level. As a result, payments fintechs would be able to sidestep state-by-state regulation. The charter would be a national version of a state money transmission license, which fintechs currently have to apply for in each state they operate in.",WMT,en,Business Insider

TikTok first filed an injunction request Wednesday as part of the company's lawsuit against the US government challenging the legality of Trump's proposed ban.

What Happened? Chinese-owned TikTok and WeChat will seemingly no longer be able to do business in the U.S. starting on Sunday, presumably unless the two companies announce deals with U.S. companies that gain the approval of President Donald Trump. Why It’s Important: TikTok has taken the U.S. by storm in 2020, and the app now has more than 100 million users. Trump has pushed for TikTok’s parent company ByteDance to sell the platform to an American company due to national security concerns. ByteDance was reportedly seeking a $30-billion valuation for TikTok in buyout negotiations, but the company recently rejected a bid from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and partner Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT ).

""Also with the backing of very strong energy cash flows and partners like Microsoft/Google/Facebook, there is more confidence in delivering on these digitisation plans"", it added. RIL is now between 14 per cent and 17 per cent of the leading Indian equity benchmarks. Morgan Stanley India strategist Ridham Desai, sees two implications of the rising weight. First, passive flows keep rising. Secondly, and more importantly, given that several active manager mandates restrict ownership of single stock at 10 per cent of the fund, such active funds will likely continue to be underweight. ""Both these factors create virtuous demand cycle for the stock like we saw between 2006-2007"", Desai said.

That doesn’t mean the video app beloved by tens of millions of teens will go dark overnight.Trump on Thursday said he wouldn’t extend a Sept. 20 deadline for a deal. But ByteDance Ltd., TikTok’s Chinese owner, may need more time to negotiate with suitors after new regulations from Beijing complicated the deal. The president has said if a deal isn’t done by the specified date then he’ll shut down TikTok.But Unlike India, which recently banned the app and immediately severed users’ access, the U.S. doesn't afford the president the authority to close down a social media site or require service providers to block access to an app. So TikTok could remain on people’s phones and they’d still be able to create dance videos, at least for a while.Experts say the more likely scenario would be requiring Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google to kick TikTok out of their app stores and cut off access to developer tools, preventing new downloads and subsequent software updates to current users.",WMT,en,Economic Times India

A simple and straightforward investment strategy that he followed over many decades helped him reach that number. Here's a look at how my grandpa built stealth wealth in the stock market. Buy good companies and hold them for a long time My grandpa was a marketing professor at the University of Arkansas. The university's location, in Fayetteville, is just a short drive from Bentonville, the home of Walmart. Through his position at the university, my grandpa got to know Sam Walton, Walmart's founder, and at some point decided to buy Walmart stock. If you held onto Walmart as long as my grandpa did, you probably made a lot of money. That stock grew to become a huge portion of his portfolio, but he didn't sell his biggest winner and rebalance. He kept on holding and the stock price kept going up.",WMT,en,Business Insider

While companies including Microsoft, Walmart, and Oracle were reportedly bidding to buy TikTok, the new rules from China could slow down negotiations. Experts and analysts told Business Insider that the tense state of affairs between the US and China seem unlikely to deescalate, and could have lasting implications for the future of tech commerce between the two countries. In the immediate term, US companies could see falling sales in China as nationalistic sentiment there turns against the US. More broadly, the internet could become even more splintered along geopolitical lines, making it increasingly difficult for companies to do business in both countries simultaneously.

Lead bidders for the floated $20- to $30 billion deal include Microsoft, in partnership with Walmart, and Oracle.

And when crude oil prices fell into negative territory in April, the recycled plastic industry experienced a reckoning. Would corporations still invest in relatively expensive circular plastic commitments if virgin plastic prices, closely tied to the petroleum industry, nosedived? So far, most big companies seem to be standing by their pledges. ""Our strategy hasn’t changed,"" Yolanda Malone, vice president of global foods packaging at PepsiCo, told a digital crowd at GreenBiz’s Circularity 20 event this week. ""We aren’t letting the oil prices and the fluctuations in the market sway us from our long-term vision. Our strategy needs to be strong enough to weather it."" Shifting the focus away from everyday volatility and instead emphasizing the long-term benefits of an overarching and durable circular packaging plan can help brands avoid reacting to oil price dynamics and enable them to ignore the small short-term benefits — such as lower virgin plastic prices — in favor of long-lasting ones, according to Malone and other speakers who addressed the topic during the online event.",WMT,en,GreenBiz

2020-08-21 06:53:57-05:00,Why online retailers should increase transparency about their products,"What would change if e-commerce retailers shared information about a product's climate footprint? When shopping online, consumers are able to see a lot of information about a product. There's the product description and specifications of an item. For a bottle of perfume, the listing would declare the fluid ounces and describe the scent. A piece of clothing would show the material makeup and available sizes. A page for a bookshelf would have information about the dimensions. And of course, all of these would display the cost. But even with so much information at the ready, it is still rare to see details about the impact the product has on the climate or the chemical makeup of an item. The Environmental Defense Fund is calling for change. ""You have this greater real estate available to share this information about products right on the product page, just like you would the size of a product or colors or product reviews and you have the ability to tell more of the sustainability story, because you essentially have endless shelf space online,"" said Boma Brown-West, senior manager of EDF+Business at the Environmental Defense Fund, the arm of EDF focused on corporate sustainability.",WMT,en,BusinessGreen

Because whether Trump likes it or not, China is the world's biggest market (by population) and second-biggest economy after the US (Chinese economists argue that it's already larger than the economy of the US) . And WeChat is critical medium through which Chinese consumers perform a multitude of tasks, from paying their bills, to ordering takeout, to shopping online - and so much more.

Tencent, which owns WeChat, said it believes the ban applies only in the U.S., but it is seeking clarity. The wording in the executive order is vague, banning any transaction that is related to WeChat, and it is up to the Commerce Department to work out the details. A WeChat ban in the United States has the potential to cause a minor drop in sales, but a WeChat ban in China would be devastating for Apple as many Chinese ‌iPhone‌ users feel their devices would be useless without the WeChat app. In a Weibo survey highlighted by Bloomberg , for example, 95 percent of the 1.2 million people who responded said they would switch to an Android smartphone over an ‌iPhone‌ rather than give up WeChat.",WMT,en,Mac Rumors

2020-08-07 08:46:42-05:00,Trump aap ban risks snarling global business,"By Zheping Huang and Vlad SavovBanning WeChat, the world’s most-used messaging app, has the potential to upend the international businesses of companies from Apple Inc. to Walmart Inc. and shut down personal communications between America and China.The White House’s vaguely worded edict left a lot of open questions about how broadly the ban would be applied and the full ramifications for Tencent Holdings Ltd. But it likely gets WeChat bumped off Apple and Google’s app stores in 45 days, which means at least suspending updates for a service vital to everything from engineers talking with iPhone assemblers to Chinese people video-chatting with family back home.If the ban extends to a block on its use, that threatens to eventually sever those ties because WeChat is the go-to for a billion people for everything from booking movie and train tickets to shopping, and alternatives like WhatsApp are blocked in China. The potential ructions underscore Tencent’s pivotal role within the global tech and internet economies, as a juggernaut with deep investments or connections with American businesses from Activision Blizzard Inc. and Snap Inc. to the NBA.“It would practically shut down communication between the U.S. and China,” said Graham Webster, China Digital Economy Fellow at think tank New America. “These orders just wrap the real issues up in political theater.”Trump’s order on WeChat came after a similar injunction against ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok, the viral video service the White House accuses of jeopardizing national security.",WMT,en,Economic Times India

No major fast-food chains or CEOs of prominent chains are donating to Trump in the 2020 election, according to a review of FEC data by Business Insider. PACs run by chains and PACs run by franchisees are donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to candidates for Congress, with chains typically donating more to Republicans than Democrats. The viral rumors started after Business Insider reported the CEO of an independent franchisee who owns Wendy's, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut locations donated more than $440,000 to Trump's campaign. A handful of wealthy industry insiders are also Trump donors, including Nelsen Peltz, who sits on Wendy's board; Stephen Ross, whose company has invested in smaller brands like &Pizza and Momofuku; and Tilman Fertitta, the CEO of Landry's, which owns Bubba Gump, Del Frisco's, and Joe's Crab Shack.

Digital therapeutics deliver evidence-based therapies via software — often in the form of consumer-facing mobile health apps — that replace or complement the existing treatment of a disease.

2020-06-05 04:13:33-05:00,How Ocean Spray cranberries became America's '100 percent sustainable' crop,"Ocean Spray reveals how it was able to certify its cranberry crop as '100 per cent sustainable' Cranberries are more than just an American Thanksgiving Day tradition; they also are a tradition of the American land. The crop is one of only three native cultivated fruits in North America. Because the plant is actually meant to grow in the natural environment, many growing and harvesting practices already help the surrounding land and could be considered sustainable, under normal conditions. The berry grows best in boggy, water-soaked soil that can't be used for many other crops. And every one acre of cranberry bog requires 5.5 acres of wild marsh needed around it - a built-in wetlands preservation strategy. ""It's a symbiotic relationship,"" said Chris Ferzli, director of global corporate affairs and communications for Ocean Spray, the well-known agricultural co-operative, which generates annual revenue of about $2bn. ""The water in natural land supports the cranberry bog and in return, the cranberry bog enriches the soil that supports outside land."" Ocean Spray recently took advantage of the crop's natural sustainability to become the first major food manufacturer in the United States to have its entire crop be certified ""100 per cent sustainable."" Specifically, the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform (SAI Platform) used its Farm Sustainability Assessment to verify that each organization within Ocean Spray's 700-farm co-op is operating with regenerative agriculture in mind.",WMT,en,BusinessGreen

To answer their question, Goldman has put together a real-time reopening scale which, since no fundamental or economic data matter, will soon become the top market-moving indicator for the US stock market. * * * One month ago, when most of the US was still behind the curve on the first wave of the corona pandemic, Goldman published a ""lockdown index"" to keep track of where on the spectrum, so to speak, various US states and country in general were to be found. One month later, the usefulness of this index appears to have peaked as markets now only care about the ""reopening"" - at least until the second coronavirus infection wave hits - and as cities and states across the U.S. begin to reverse lockdown measures at different paces and with different processes in place, Goldman has introduced a new index and weekly series that will measure the pace this reopening is happening by looking at a wide range of data from “Stay at Home” (food delivery, eCommerce, streaming media, grocery sales, etc.) to “Back to Normal” (commuting, box office, travel, etc.) and business activity (freight, housing, equipment sales, etc).",WMT,en,Zero Hedge

Michels' theory states that all complex organizations, regardless of how democratic they are when started, eventually develop into oligarchies. Michels observed that since no sufficiently large and complex organization can function purely as a direct democracy, power within an organization will always get delegated to individuals within that group, elected or otherwise.

Authored by John Whitehead via The Rutherford Institute, Cash may well become a casualty of the COVID-19 pandemic… As these COVID-19 lockdowns drag out, more and more individuals and businesses are going cashless (for convenience and in a so-called effort to avoid spreading coronavirus germs), engaging in online commerce or using digital forms of currency (bank cards, digital wallets, etc.). As a result, physical cash is no longer king. Yet there are other, more devious, reasons for this re-engineering of society away from physical cash: a cashless society—easily monitored, controlled, manipulated, weaponized and locked down—would play right into the hands of the government (and its corporate partners). To this end, the government and its corporate partners-in-crime have been waging a subtle war on cash for some time now. What is this war on cash? It’s a concerted campaign to shift consumers towards a digital mode of commerce that can easily be monitored, tracked, tabulated, mined for data, hacked, hijacked and confiscated when convenient.",WMT,en,Zero Hedge

The government in the United States and Canada has decided to take away the guesswork in the stores that are still open and decide for you what’s “essential” and what’s not. When I have gone to the store to pick up groceries (I’m still getting fresh produce while I can), I also like to pick up a couple of things that are pleasant diversions: magazines, a crossword puzzle book, coloring pencils, some craft supplies. It’s nice to have some things that are enjoyable on hand to keep lockdown from feeling so grim and torturous. If the store is already open, getting a sunny yellow pillow for the living room is a pick-me-up, not a frivolous jaunt to a place I wasn’t already going.

The overall industry's sales grew 4% year-over-year (YoY), a notable improvement from Q4 2018 when total retail grew just 3.4% annually. Meanwhile, e-commerce grew much faster in Q4 2019 and also bested its Q4 2018 results, posting a 16.4% YoY growth rate compared with the 10.8% YoY growth of the previous year. Q4 2018's performance was a steep deceleration from Q4 2017, when total retail sales surged by 5.1% YoY and e-commerce sales increased by 16.5% annually, so Q4 2019's return to acceleration is surely a positive sign for retailers. Here are three major takeaways based on the US retail industry's recently reported performance for Q4 2019 and 2019 overall.",WMT,en,Business Insider

On the plus side, crude has really turned things around this week, with front-month crude futures (/CL) starting the day around $54 a barrel. We’re approaching the end of another week, so even though this may sound like a broken record, investors might want to stay on their toes today and tomorrow for some potential profit-taking pressure ahead of the weekend.

Police are able to request Ring footage from any household near a crime scene. The Ring user would have to consent to their video being shared, but once shared, the police are able to keep the footage indefinitely.

That’s because the Motile M142 is Walmart’s house brand, and it’s one that the retailer itself often passes over to promote brand-name PCs. Yes, the M142 cuts some corners. At about 6.5 hours, its battery life is comparatively poor. The screen is somewhat dim, and lacks touchscreen capabilities. Given the price, however, it’s a laptop we wouldn’t mind recommending to friends and family with tight budgets. The M142 has one notable thing going for it: AMD’s mobile Ryzen 3000-series chips. For years, seeing an older AMD A-series chip among the listed specifications meant a lackluster experience. With AMD’s mobile Ryzen, that’s changed. The M142 generally outperforms our current best budget laptop, the Acer Aspire 5 A515-54-51DJ , and for a price that’s about $100 less. To read this article in full, please click here",WMT,en,PCWorld

It is part of India's efforts to become a $5 trillion economy by 2024, from around $2.7 trillion currently, the documents said.But the draft text of the new law dated Nov. 15 does not cover demands related to enforcement of tax obligations, a critical area of concern for foreign investors.Several firms including IBM, Royal Dutch Shell and Vodafone have collectively faced billions of dollars in tax claims from India's government in recent years, leading to arbitration cases and protracted legal battles in courts.A separate internal government document which analyses the draft law noted that taxation issues were of ""great interest"" to investors and excluding it from the law's purview could reduce the proposal's intent to boost their comfort level.Nevertheless, the document defended the exclusion, saying ""the power to tax is an integral part of the state's police powers even recognised in international law"".The Finance Ministry, which drafted the law, did not respond to a request for comment.Two sources familiar with deliberations on the law said it could still undergo several changes before it is finalised.",WMT,en,The Economic Times India

In a ruling issued Jan. 6, the three-judge panel from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the drivers were entitled to compensation under California law because Walmart had exercised control over their schedules during mandated layovers and other breaks.

Generally, when people refer to ocean container rates, they are either referring to fixed-rates (""contract rates""), or variable-rates (""spot rates""). For all containers moving in and out of the U.S., rates (both contract and spot rates) are required to be filed with the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) 30 days in advance of the containerized cargo being shipped. This adds an additional layer of complexity to the way ocean container rates are negotiated and governed. In order to effectively explain the process through which ocean container rates are negotiated and managed, we will examine a specific trade lane known as the trans-Pacific Eastbound.

In 2005 he wrote an article entitled “How We Would Fight China”, though he didn’t say when or why we will be doing that fighting, or even the how as per the title. Well the tears are flowing now as the relationship is mostly over. China’s share of world exports peaked just shy of 15% in 2015 and is now contracting. China’s share of world GDP is also about 15% and that too will contract. In Carroll Quigley’s ‘ Tragedy and Hope’ first published in 1966, he wrote that the Chinese Communist regime in the first years after its founding was “insanely aggressive.” The Chicoms reverted to type about ten years ago and went back to ‘snarl diplomacy.’ Only being poor had kept them from trying to impose their will on others.

Authored by Patrick Hill via RealInvestmentAdvice.com, Recently, analysts have been discussing the pros and cons of using negative interest rates to keep the U.S. economy growing. Despite this, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said that he does not anticipate the Federal Reserve will implement a policy of negative interest rates as it may be detrimental to the economy. One argument against negative interest rates is that they would squeeze bank margins and create more financial uncertainty. However, upon examining the actual rate of inflation we are likely already in a ‘de facto’ negative ­­interest rate environment. Multiple inflation data sources show that actual inflation maybe 5%. With the ten year Treasury bond at 1.75%, there is an interest rate gap of – 3.25%. Let’s look at multiple inflation data points to understand why there is such a divergence between the Fed assumptions that inflation is under control versus the much higher rate of price hikes consumers experience.",WMT,en,Zero Hedge

It is also a sign of how Thursday evening store openings have continued to hurt what has traditionally been a day that kicked off the US holiday season. The importance on the shopping calendar of Black Friday, or the day after the US Thanksgiving Day holiday, has waned in recent years. This is due to the choice by many retailers to open their stores on Thursday evening, as well as to early holiday promotions and year-round discounts.

Writing in Forbes , Dans professes to be unclear as to the motive of the big e-tailers to lose money on every fresh grocery shipment other than it become a net positive for one of them to lose on every transaction in return for cornering the market because of its low price points. The damage is especially noticeable in markets like New York City, where Walmart unit Jet.com confirmed last week that it would stop deliveries on fresh products to focus on dry goods because it was losing $20 on each delivery. If Walmart can't hack it, how does one expect local merchants to, according to Dans.

2019-11-25 11:24:59-05:00,Housing Starts To Build Hope For Downtrodden Freight Market,"If you have seen the Lego movies, you will know the theme songs quite well—""Everything is Awesome"" in part one and ""Everything's Not Awesome"" in part two. These songs could be the theme songs to the 2018 and 2019 economy and subsequently the freight market. The overheating and overspending in 2018 was bound to have a hangover effect at some point. Companies over-invested, driving costs higher at too rapid of a pace until demand dried up, leaving the freight market oversupplied with trucks with less to move. There is a glimmer of hope, however, as the housing and construction sectors are starting to perk up at a somewhat strange time of the year. First, let's take a look at a few other major sectors that impact freight. Retail demand drives a lot of the freight market throughout the year, but more significantly in the late third and fourth quarters as shippers like Walmart and Target stock the shelves for the flood of consumption that has now become embedded in American culture over the past few decades.",WMT,en,Benzinga Feeds

However, the Switch included with the ""Mario Kart 8 Deluxe"" bundle is actually an older version of the console with less battery life than the newer model Nintendo released this summer. The original version of the Switch (model number HAC-001) only had a projected battery life of 2.5 to 6.5 hours, whereas the new model (HAC-001(-01)) can last anywhere from 4.5 to nine hours. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

One of those things is technology. A Thanksgiving staple in plastic netting. Image courtesy Anthony Easton/flickr. People often ask, what are the greatest technological achievements of all time?

They also involve combinations of technologies, arranged in new and unique ways to do something big. In my mind, great technological achievements are not mega events, they are subtle little breakthroughs that change everything. I think of the discovery of the simple machines, including the wheel—and the axle. The lever. The pulley. The inclined plane.",WMT,en,PlasticsToday

It also means we could have a thin market because bond trading is closed. The weak volume and slow trading last Friday didn’t happen in a vacuum. With investors anticipating a quieter market on Monday without as many players, people might not have been as anxious to buy stocks ahead of the holiday. Veteran’s Day is typically slow, and there really isn’t any reason to expect anything different this year. The market has a softer tone early Monday following losses overseas. Factors at play here appear to include unrest in Hong Kong, a decline in Chinese producer prices that raised more concern about China’s economy, and a rising dollar. We just finished an impressive stretch with the S&P 500 Index (SPX) now up five weeks in a row. Some of the momentum appeared to fade toward the end of last week, but that might have reflected pre-holiday consolidation and possibly a little profit-taking as investors lightened up.

That’d be unusual anywhere, but that it’s happening in India offers some hope for the country’s long-awaited tech renaissance. This is also great news for Walmart Inc. The U.S. retail behemoth paid $16 billion for 77% of India e-commerce company Flipkart Group in May last year. That deal included payments unit PhonePe — an early pioneer in the digital-wallet business — which Flipkart had acquired two years earlier. Now Walmart is engineering a spinoff as part of a $1 billion funding round that could value payment unit at up to $10 billion and give the retailer an 82% stake in PhonePe and Flipkart, India’s Economic Times reported. From one $20.8 billion company 18 months ago, India will get two unicorns at a combined value of up to $30 billion.There are already indications that PhonePe has shed its Flipkart training wheels. From 50% of its transactions three years ago, Flipkart now accounts for just 0.5%, Indian media outlet The Ken reported, citing PhonePe’s head of strategy and planning.","WIT,WMT",en,The Economic Times India

A C-suiter explained to us how the delivery giant is doing it differently than everyone else —and what's behind dumping Amazon.,"FedEx made waves in the industry recently for dumping Amazon as a partner.

Among US internet users who expect to spend more with Amazon during the holidays in 2019 than they did in 2018, 52% expect Amazon to steal some of their sales from Walmart, while 32% said the same for Target, according to a report from Coresight Research sent to Business Insider Intelligence. Respondents noted that Amazon will steal holiday spend from a number of other retailers too, including Best Buy (23%), Kohl's (20%), JCPenney (18%), and eBay (16%).

CareCredit has both short- and long-term financing options. The short-term option has 0% interest for up to 24 months, and the long-term option gets you a reduced APR of 14.90% to 17.90% for up to 60 months. It can be a good option for paying down expensive treatments, but only if you pay off your purchase in full by the end of the promotional term. CareCredit is different than your average credit card. It offers financing for health, wellness, and beauty-related treatments and other procedures that aren't covered by your insurance. If you have these expenses, CareCredit's financing offers with 0% interest periods can be appealing, though it's very important you read the fine print and pay the full amount by the end of the promotional period so you're not hit with huge interest rates.

To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here. Walmart's first standalone primary care clinic, dubbed Walmart Health, will be piloted in Dallas, Georgia, and housed in a building next to Walmart's retail store. Patients will be able to receive a variety of primary care services at the clinic, including immunizations, lab tests, dental care, optometry, audiology, and behavioral health services. Sources close to Walmart told CNBC that, should the pilot prove successful, the retail giant will likely scale up its primary care offerings across its nearly 5,000 locations. Wading deeper into primary care makes sense for Walmart: Health and wellness made up approximately 9%, or $36 billion , of its $332 billion total revenue for its last fiscal year (ended January 31, 2019). The company could also be shoring up defenses against digital disruption in the pharmacy space by investing heavily in dedicated clinical locations for services that require face-to-face interaction, like lab procedures and dental work: Shockwaves spread throughout the industry last year after Amazon acquired digital pharmacy startup PillPack in 2016, for instance.",WMT,en,Business Insider

The Indian government weakened several of its foreign direct investment (FDI) rules, which impact foreign companies, including the requirements for single brands that want to sell in India, per Quartz . Previously, brands with significant foreign investment had to open a physical store in India before selling online in the market and needed to source "" 30% of the value of goods purchased"" from India, making it difficult for brands to sell in the country. But now, foreign brands can sell online two years before opening a brick-and-mortar location in India, and the 30% requirement has been relaxed to consider more aspects of sourcing, like materials sold in India.

It developed the cash-on-delivery model and made its own billion-dollar logistics unit in an economy rife with a fractured logistics system. After building a business up from scratch, the ecommerce company stirred up the market further in 2018 when Walmart acquired it for $16 billion. All this while, another potentially mammoth business was sprouting under its shadows.The foundation of this business came from Flyte, the digital music and content business Flipkart tried to build in 2012. But the online music store couldn’t beat the odds. Neither e-wallets nor paying for music were widespread in India then. A bunch of other reasons also led to the venture closing within a year. But the lack of a smooth online payment process had planted the seeds of a potential money-spinner: a payments platform.The brains behind Flyte, Sameer Nigam and Rahul Chari, used the learnings from their failed venture to exit Flipkart and set up PhonePe in 2015, hoping to ride the coat-tails of India’s exploding digital payments ecosystem.",WMT,en,The Economic Times India

Millions of Indians gained regular access to the internet for the first time over the past three years.

2019-08-16 00:33:25-05:00,Here's how India can regain its textile glory,"By Ajay SrivastavaA look at last year’s apparel export figures is chastening. China exported $145 billion, Bangladesh $36 billion, Vietnam $33 billion and India a mere $17 billion. India is far behind China and steadily losing to smaller countries.The biggest reason is India’s near absence from the main product category that accounts for 70% of world trade in apparels – synthetic apparels. Today, most formal, sports and fashion wear uses synthetic fabrics. They are durable, do not fade, can have any colour. Easy blending with wool, cotton, or rubber allows experimentation. Unsurprisingly, synthetics have overtaken cottons and become favourites of the fashion industry.With weak synthetics, India’s apparel industry is a horse running with one leg tied. The results are low exports, low wages, and low investments in the sector. Here is how.Globally cotton dominates spring and summer sales seasons. Synthetics and blends dominate autumn and winter seasons. Indian units run six months a year to produce cotton apparels.",WMT,en,The Economic Times India

What’s more, the brick-and-mortar segment is no longer worried about online discounts because there is “more sanity” in the market.At Amazon’s Prime Day sale and Flipkart’s Big Shopping Days this week – the first major online promotional events held since foreign investment rules for e-commerce were tightened in February – the average discounts had halved to 5-10% from 10-20% last year, industry executives said.Still, sales increased by up to 80% from a year earlier and were two to five times the level of regular daily business, three executives said.

But when an acute shortage of banknotes gave a fillip to digital wallets, that purpose was added as an afterthought to justify an act of farcical state overreach.The real innovation in mobile payments in India began a few months prior to the cash ban. It’s called a unified payment interface, or UPI. The name is clunky, but the idea is simple. One smartphone owner who’s a customer of Bank A can request a payment from, or initiate a payment to, another owner who has an account with Bank B. Neither party needs to know anything more than each other’s mobile number or a virtual ID. They don’t even need to use the same mobile app to transact. In this, India was ahead of even Asian money centers like Singapore and Hong Kong. With more than 140 Indian banks sharing the interface, and Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook Inc.’s WhatsApp offering instantaneous payment services on it, UPI has become a keenly watched experiment.",WMT,en,The Economic Times India

The comments come as support for real-time settlement gains steam in the US — a favorability that seems likely to grow as RTP becomes widely available, particularly among consumers and merchants. Internationally, Mastercard-owned Vocalink and other players have been launching real-time settlement functionality for years. But in the US, the technology is newer: In 2017, The Clearing House (TCH), with support from Vocalink (now owned by Mastercard), launched a Real-Time Payments system, and last fall, the US Fed began early-stage research into developing a similar platform — a move supported by both major retailers like Walmart and Target as well as big tech.",WMT,en,Business Insider

America’s favorite pancake topper—Aunt Jemima, a PepsiCo brand that last year reached 132 million consumers—is, in fact, made of corn syrup. It contains zero maple tree sap. The same is true of the two other top-selling syrup brands, Mrs. Butterworth’s and Log Cabin. If, however, you poured “pure maple syrup” this morning, then there’s a good chance you were using the product of a cartel. More than 70% of all maple syrup sold worldwide, and most of the maple syrup consumed in the U.S., comes from a single Canadian conglomerate, the Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers. The OPEC-like entity at last count was holding 7.5 million gallons in barrels, waiting for prices—currently at about $33 per gallon—to rise. Is the $500 million maple syrup industry ripe for a new brand steeped in wholesome artisan charisma? A small Vermont company thinks it is.

Walmart reported earnings for its fiscal Q1 2020 (ended April 26, 2019), announcing that its US comparable sales growth was up 3.4% year-over-year (YoY), its best performance in nine years.

Arvind Fashion is said to be in talks with Walmart-owned Flipkart to offload the India licences for a raft of foreign brands, including Izod, Nautica, Gant and Ed Hardy, according to people familiar with the development. US-based VF Corp, owner of the Vans brand, is also said to be talking to the ecommerce company to sell its India licence, they added. “The trend is that the brands that do not find favour with the consumers through offline stores are now going through the online channels,” said Harminder Sahni, cofounder of retail consultancy Wazir Advisors. 69191097 Flipkart said questions about such talks were speculative. “We always work closely with all Indian brand owners/partners to list and grow their brands on our marketplace,” a Flipkart spokesperson said in an email. “It is deeply satisfying that brands are also seeing us as an unparalleled and unique channel for their growth and also to strength positioning in India.” The Flipkart group controls about 65% of the online fashion business in India along with its Myntra and Jabong portals. “Online is an effective and low-cost kind of a channel as there are no fixed costs attached to the brands themselves,” Sahni said. “Flipkart want the rights to manufacture Vans products to be sold in India,” said one of the persons cited above.",WMT,en,The Economic Times India

It’s a clear pivot toward consumer offerings in a country that’s becoming a battleground for giants such as Amazon.com and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart Online Services Pvt.“The deals may be tiny, but it’s more likely that they are putting together a team of talented people by acquisitions, who can then be invested in to build out larger platform products,” said Kunal Agrawal, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.Ambani is racing to grab a share of an online shopping market that Morgan Stanley estimates will grow to be valued at $200 billion by 2028 from about $30 billion last year.",WMT,en,The Economic Times India

That has led some customers to threaten to boycott and cut themselves off from Amazon completely. Amazon relies on the interconnectedness of its services — and Amazon Prime in particular — to keep customers in its ecosystem. But there are plenty of alternatives to nearly all of its offerings, if you're willing to do a little research. Amazon is quickly growing to be one of the most powerful companies on earth, spreading into so many categories and offering so many services that it can be difficult to keep track of them. With such rapid growth, it was bound to catch the eye of both scrutinizing politicians and customers who might be inherently distrustful of such a large organization. Amazon's repuation has taken a beating over the last year, with high-profile detractors like Sen. Bernie Sanders repeatedly criticizing the company over its workplace practices and pay standards. Amazon is one of Sanders' top examples of a company that has become too powerful, and he frequently makes reference to CEO Jeff Bezos' incredible wealth in his criticisms.",WMT,en,Business Insider

2019-03-26 11:30:00-05:00,"UPS just beat out Amazon, FedEx, and Uber to make America's first revenue-generating drone delivery","UPS , in partnership with drone technology company Matternet , began its daily drone delivery of medical supplies within the WakeMed Raleigh campus on Tuesday. This cuts the drone delivery time of crucial medical specimen from half an hour to just over three minutes. It is the first revenue-generating drone delivery ever — and the first commercial application of the much-hyped and highly regulated technology. UPS is part of a public-private US Department of Transportation drone testing program that rolled out in spring 2018. Amazon , which has made highly-publicized moves into drone testing, was not included in the program. Moving medical samples around WakeMed Raleigh's sprawling medical campus can sometimes take up to 30 minutes in traffic. That can be challenging when the material being moved is life-saving specimen like blood or organ samples. But today, that commute has been cut to three minutes and 15 seconds — thanks to drone delivery. UPS, in collaboration with drone technology company Matternet, made its first revenue-generating delivery of medical samples at WakeMed Raleigh on Tuesday.",WMT,en,Business Insider

In this op-ed, Nakai argues that Microsoft Excel, which has been used by the investment community for years, is no longer relevant for picking stocks. The explosion of alternative data in particular has pushed stock analysis beyond what Excel is capable of. Most investors are equipped for megabytes. Winners are equipped for terabytes. The vast majority of institutional investors today use Microsoft Excel as the primary tool for picking stocks. It isn’t working. During the last decade, hedge funds have underperformed a simple 60/40 equity/bond split almost every year. Hundreds of billions of dollars continue to shift from mutual funds towards passive strategies. Yet the ubiquity of spreadsheets has persisted. An objective observer might find it peculiar why the investment community does not question the utility of their bread-winning tool, despite leading many to famine. It is time for money managers to ask themselves this basic question: “What if the tools we are using are no longer appropriate for investing?” Today, ""alternative data"" is becoming more common as an incremental tool to address performance woes.",WMT,en,Business Insider

2019-02-19 08:38:24-05:00,31 Kirkland Products Retirees Should Buy at Costco,"For many, retirement is a time to pinch pennies on everyday expenses. It might help explain why retirees are so fond of Costco. Research shows that older shoppers tend to prefer the discount warehouse club over popular retailers such as Walmart and Target. Further, baby boomers -- there are about 74 million of them alive today in the U.S. -- are more likely than millennials to renew their Costco memberships, which run $60 to $120 a year. As a boomer and regular Costco shopper, I've learned over the years that some of the best values can be found in the warehouse club's own Kirkland Signature line of products. In fact, one in five products on Costco's shelves carry the Kirkland brand. Many of these exclusive items hold unique appeal to retirees as well as near-retirees like me. Oh, and don't let an empty nest discourage you from buying in bulk. Check expiration dates, stock up on items with long shelf lives, and remember that a surprising number of foods can be frozen. Take a look at our list of retiree-friendly Kirkland products from Costco.",WMT,en,Kiplinger

2019-02-12 15:35:00-05:00,Amazon Hikes Prices At Whole Foods As Consumers Brace For Inflationary Tidal Wave,"Feb. 12, 2019 is a day that will live on in the annals of American industry. Because it's the day we finally learned - thanks to a repoert in the Wall Street Journal - that Jeff Bezos (and, presumably, his investors) tolerance for loss-making businesses does have its limits. According to emails obtained by the paper, Amazon-owned Whole Foods Market raised prices this month on dozens of items ranging from Dr. Bronner’s soaps to Häagen-Dazs ice cream. These prices hikes followed increases on another 55 items, including crackers, olives and cookies, according to an email from December. The reason for the price hikes? As we have previously reported , Clorox, Coca-Cola and Mondelez are just a few of the producers of consumer products, snack foods and beverages who were preparing to raise prices. According to figures cited by WSJ, nearly half of 52 consumer-goods manufacturers surveyed recently by consulting firm Acosta raised prices last year. The hikes, we argued at the time, would blindside consumers who have grown accustomed to sub-2% inflation in a world where the Phillips Curve has broken down.",WMT,en,Zero Hedge

2019-02-06 22:05:00-05:00,"The ""Retail Apocalypse"" Isn't Over: It Is Only Just Getting Started","Last year's holiday sales season was one of the strongest in years . But unfortunately for America's struggling retailers, many missed out on the sales bonanza as Amazon and other e-commerce platforms accrued nearly all of the sales growth while foot traffic at US malls was stagnant. Already, Kohl's and Macy's have helped crush the narrative of the strong consumer by slashing their earnings guidance, something that doesn't bode well for Q4 GDP , thanks to what we warned would be an unsustainable inventory build up that has inflated growth numbers in recent quarters. The retail space has already seen the first headline-grabbing retail bankruptcy of the year (see: Gymboree ). And as Bloomberg warned in a story published this week, even after high-profile bankruptcies including Sears and Toys R' Us , the ""retail apocalypse"" is far from over. Though the Fed has capitulated to the whims of the market, retailers still make up about one-fifth of the universe of distresses borrowers.

2019-01-28 05:00:00-05:00,"'Election-Meddler' Wasserman Schultz Now ""Fixing Democracy"" In Venezuela","Regime change and foreign interventions are things that the two US ruling parties agree on regardless of how much they exchange blows at home. Venezuela is the latest place where Republicans and Democrats have found common ground. If you watch the US media, you know what is happening in Venezuela: Dictator Nicolas Maduro is brutally suppressing the people he has been robbing for years, and now they have revolted and elected a true representative of their interest, the one true legitimate acting president Juan Guaido. And now, as RT's Alexandre Antonov reports below , it’s up to America to ‘fix’ democracy by whatever means necessary. The House Foreign Affairs Committee has even offered a simple explanation on how a ‘dream team’ of Democrats have prepared a package of laws, which will ensure Venezuela’s transition into a better future. We refuse to recognize the legitimacy of Maduro’s presidency. That’s why @RepEliotEngel , @RepDWStweets , @RepShalala , and @RepDMP are joining to introduce legislation to support the people of #Venezuela and hold the illegitimate President accountable for the crisis he created. pic.twitter.com/3JBCJLmwLf — House Foreign Affairs Committee (@HouseForeign) January 11, 2019 Debbie Mucarsel-Powell will be bringing humanitarian aid, Donna Shalala will stop the arming of Maduro’s thugs with batons and tear gas, while Debbie Wasserman Schultz gets arguably the hardest task of them all – taking on Russia’s President Vladimir Putin.",WMT,en,Zero Hedge
