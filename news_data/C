As bankers wonder what the future might hold as far as when they'll be returning to the office for good (if they haven't already), Bloomberg has published a wide-ranging interview with Corbat on Friday as he prepares to hand over the reins to Jane Fraser, set to become the first woman to ever lead an American megabank. During the interview, Corbat addressed reports that WFH has - counterintuitively - led to a surge in productivity as the bank's workers pull long hours and 7-day weeks. He added that productivity like this could come with serious long-term drawbacks. ""People talk about the productivity that comes with working remotely,” Corbat said in a televised interview for a Bloomberg Invest Talks event that aired Friday. “Well, if I worked seven days a week, 15 to 16 hours a day and I don’t take any holidays, at least for a period of time I’m going to be more productive.” Although he's concerned about the ""hollowing out"" of workers' skill sets, Corbat says Citi should take its time to assess how WFH impacts productivity over the long term, arguing that a final decision about WFH policies shouldn't be made in hast. ""I don’t want to wake up as an industry and have hollowed out our skill sets,"" Corbat said.

To be sure, Obama’s 2008 Republican opponent, the late John McCain, was a CFR member, too. Michael Froman later negotiated the TPP and TTIP international trade agreements, before returning to the CFR as a Distinguished Fellow.

The upgrade marks Google's deepest foray yet into the US financial system, just as the pandemic speeds up the shift toward a ""cashless society"" and authorities raise concerns about Chinese super-apps such as Alipay and WeChat.

The Q3 decline owes to consumers and businesses resuming payments as the economy began to reopen and social distancing measures eased in many regions. But spiking coronavirus infection rates across the US have raised concerns that the dip in deferrals could only be temporary. US banks pulled back on loan loss provisions across the board in Q3, suggesting confidence in customers' improving financial situations—but gauging the level of risk they face remains a challenge. Bank of America (BofA), Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and JPMorgan Chase have taken more than $62 billion in charges in total for future loan losses this year, largely in the first two quarters, per the FT. They tapered back their allocations in Q3, as more customers exited deferral programs and resumed regular payments: BofA, for example, set aside $1.39 billion for loan losses in Q3, far lower than the $5.12 billion it allocated in Q2.",C,en,Business Insider

Crisis yes, maybe even a touch of market turmoil for a few weeks in March, but never something that would embroil the world’s mightiest financial institutions, the way that subprime mortgages embroiled them 12 years before. So starting in March, a series of emergency measures were rolled out that temporarily eliminated or blunted restrictions on bank balance sheets, along with ramped up support for financial markets that in the US at least, was unprecedented. Risky Finance joined forces with Washington DC-based advocacy group Americans for Financial Reform to analyze some of the impact on the six biggest US banks. Our research showed that the key limiting constraint this year for the banks has been the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), part of the 2012 Dodd-Frank Act that harmonised US bank regulation with global Basel rules.",C,en,Zero Hedge

I am an Enemy to all banks discounting bills, or notes for anything but Coin. If the American People allow private banks to control the issuance of their currency, first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the People of all their Property until their Children will wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered.” – Thomas Jefferson. (1743-1826). If we look at just one example of “depriving the People of their Property” as Jefferson stated, the consequences for the ordinary man are devastating.

We’ll hear tomorrow from Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and BlackRock. Then on Wednesday, we have UnitedHealth Group, Bank of America, ASML, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and United Airlines. Thursday sees releases from Morgan Stanley and Walgreens Boots Alliance. And on Friday we’ll get earnings from Honeywell International and BNY Mellon. A summary of this week's reporters is below courtesy of Earnings Whispers: This week's earnings aside, Goldman's David Kostin over the weekend minimized the importance of Q3 earnings for the broader market, which he listed as third in order of importance behind a Covid vaccine and the elections. There is a reason why the Goldman strategist may want to minimize the importance of the next 4 weeks, because as he admits, the consequences of the semi-frozen economy on an uneven road to recovery will be visible in 3Q results: consensus expects 3Q S&P 500 EPS will decline by 21% on a year/year basis, following a 32% drop in 2Q and a 15% fall in 1Q.",C,en,Zero Hedge

As DB's Jim Reid adds, there will also be some attention on the European Council summit on Thursday and Friday at an important point in the UK-EU negotiations. This meeting has previously been Prime Minister Johnson’s self-imposed deadline to reach agreement on a trade deal. It seems progress has been made and if this continues talks will likely continue beyond that self imposed UK deadline. Mr Johnson held weekend talks with Macron and Merkel so the right people are talking. Bloomberg is reporting that the French are digging in their heels over fishing rights and this is now the main issue. Elsewhere, in terms of the regular data and central bank calendar, this week is a fairly quiet one.

The company said Tuesday that it will remove Facebook pages, groups and Instagram accounts for “representing QAnon” — even if they don’t promote violence. The social network said it will consider a variety of factors to decide if a group meets its criteria for a ban, including its name, the biography or “about” section of the page, and discussions within the page, group or Instagram account. Mentions of QAnon in a group focused on a different subject won't necessarily lead to a ban, Facebook said. Administrators of banned groups will have their personal accounts disabled as well.

A representative for Citigroup was not available to comment at press time.

While the dollar share of global reserves increased in the first quarter of 2020, it fell sharply in Q2, resuming a more than two-year trend downward. The share of euros making up global reserves rose slightly and the share of yen dropped. The second quarter saw the largest build-up of reserves in Chinese RMB and “other currencies” The increase in dollar reserves in Q1 was likely an anomaly triggered by increased valuation and safe-haven buying during the early stages of the COVID-19 panic. A Bank of America report concluded, “the de-dollarization theme appears intact.” According to its data, the share of US holdings has declined to 61.3%, “slightly more than expected based on FX, bond and equity valuation changes.” Central bank reserves globally rose significantly as they aggressively intervened in foreign exchange (FX) markets.",C,en,Zero Hedge

In so doing, the SEC is dampening an important risk signal to corporate management and investors, especially with respect to environmental, social and governance issues. The change appears to have been heavily influenced by a network of corporate oil and gas interests, and is likely to be contested in court. First, some background. Shareholders in publicly traded companies have the right to vote on certain corporate matters.

As shown in the table below, the capital levels determined by the Fed’s most recent stress-test process, give Goldman Sachs the highest CET1 Capital Requirement target among domestic banks, with an overall capital minimum at 13.7% of risk-weighted assets, while Morgan Stanley is second with a target of 13.4%; JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, will need to maintain 11.3% under the standards taking effect Oct. 1.",C,en,Zero Hedge

The first quarter was rough, but it really only reflected a couple of weeks in March.” Loan losses are expected to rise as spiking unemployment has left many unable to service, or pay back, their loans.

Portfolio manager Alberto Gallo, who runs the Algebris Macro Credit Fund, said that while the market outlook is “bumpy”, there are “very good returns” available in credit markets for patient investors. Gallo’s strategy - which trades bank debt, sovereigns, and investment grade and high yield corporate debt, has so far advanced 2.68 per cent month-to-date. Having initially remained cautious throughout January and February, putting more than half of the portfolio in cash, Gallo did not expect the market reaction to the Covid-19 outbreak to be as deep as the 2008 slide. But speaking on Algebris Investments’ podcast update, he noted how the sharp unwind of heavily levered funds – especially in the hedge fund space – has compounded the sell-off to create value across good quality assets. “We took advantage of that and we invested the fund up to 70-75 per cent, adding in assets which are solid companies that are strategic and can resist even in a prolonged shutdown,” he explained, citing telecom companies such as Vodafone and Telefonica, larger systemic banks including Société Générale, Barlcays and ING, and Citigroup in the US, and US industrials such as General Electric. “We have improved the quality of our portfolio,” he said of recent positioning.",C,en,Hedgeweek

The US government had initiated the TARP at the height of the Wall Street financial crisis of 2008. The US Treasury Department created the TARP fund to stabilize the financial system and restore economic growth. TARP was rolled out to accomplish targets by purchasing troubled companies' assets and stock. September of 2008 saw a worldwide freeze as global credit markets came to a near standstill as several major financial institutions, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and American International Group (AIG), experienced severe financial stress and others, like Lehman Brothers went bankrupt due to the effects of the sub-prime mortgage crisis that had begun the previous year.",C,en,Sify.com

About a year ago we described how modern financial systems have grown dependent on central bank balance sheets , and why another round of easing from the US Federal Reserve — a “QE4” — was vital for markets. Fed chair Jay Powell has so far proved sufficiently flexible to reverse the balance sheet shrinkage, to which his immediate two predecessors, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, had been committed. The “Fed Listens”, as the name of its tour of US cities suggests and, true to form, recent worries in the repo market spurred the central bank to inject a further $400bn into the financial sector.

2019-06-13 08:33:35-05:00,11 dairy-free foods that are high in calcium,"Despite being rich in calcium, dairy has its drawbacks . Fortunately, it's far from the only way to get calcium in your diet. Leafy greens and other produce, like figs and acorn squash, are good sources of calcium. Nuts and seeds may be tiny, but many are calcium-dense. Soybeans, tofu, tempeh, soy milk, and other soy products can contain a lot of calcium. Milk has calcium and your bones need calcium, so milk gives you strong bones. Right? Thanks to a very good marketing campaign, this is the common wisdom. But it turns out milk, calcium, and strong bones might not be tied together as closely as we've all come to believe. Osteoporosis , or loss of bone density, is enemy No. 1 when it comes to health issues that calcium is supposed to prevent. And while scientists haven't settled on a magic number when it comes to calcium intake and bone health (not to mention that calcium is only one of many factors), there is a consensus that calcium matters. What's less certain is that dairy, bones' supposed best friend, is the best source of calcium.",C,en,Business Insider

Odds are in favour of the Fed having gone too far already and the stock market figuring it out in due course... — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) January 30, 2019 Which has hurt the dollar, helping gold to its sixth January gains in a row as investors sought a haven against slowing growth and U.S.-China trade disputes. While short interest in GLD (Gold ETF) has soared along with price... Bloomberg survey results show a decidedly positive bias on the precious metal (Bullish: 13 Bearish: 2 Neutral: 2) If the Fed’s rate-hike cycle really has come to an end for now, the sooner-than-expected dollar weakness may help gold to “rise more quickly and more sharply,” Commerzbank said in a note. “Both the tone and language of the Fed statement and presser appeared more accommodative versus consensus expectations,” Citigroup Inc. analysts including Aakash Doshi wrote in a note. “To take advantage of an ongoing gold market rally, investors might consider positioning for upside.” “Gold is benefiting from a lower dollar in general, as well as safe-haven buyers hedging against the outcome of the U.S.-China trade talks,” Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp. in Singapore, said in a note.",C,en,Zero Hedge
2019-01-28 12:37:14-05:00,CBO Unveils Apocalyptic Long-Term Debt Picture With US Set To Borrow Over $1 Trillion For Second Year,"On Monday morning, the CBO announced in its latest forecast that, as widely expected, U.S. budget deficits are set to widen further in coming years and economic gains will be muted"" - a growth outlook that’s weaker than the Trump administration’s target of at least 3 percent growth. However, the surprise was that contrary to the CBO's last forecast, the budget deficit is now expected to hit $1 trillion two years later than previously projected. Specifically, the U.S. budget deficit is forecast to widen to ""only"" $897 billion over the 12 months through September, from $779 billion last year. This means that contrary to the CBO's last forecast in April, the U.S. budget deficit will top $1 trillion in fiscal 2022. The CBO estimated in April that the budget deficit for the entire fiscal year would increase to $804 billion, before widening to $981 billion in fiscal 2019 and topping $1 trillion in 2020. “That reduction in projected deficits results primarily from legislative changes -- most notably a decrease in emergency spending,” the CBO said, somewhat optimistically especially since the economy is forecast to slow over the next three years with the growth rate easing to 2.3% in 2019, 1.7% next year, and 1.6% in 2021, the CBO forecasted; growth was an estimated 3.1% last year. “The slowdown begins in 2019 as the positive effects of recent tax legislation on business investment are expected to wane and federal purchases under current law are projected to drop sharply starting in the fourth quarter of this year,” according to the report.",C,en,Zero Hedge

California passed legislation last year in the aftermath of the deadly Wine Country fires requiring utilities to post public notices for employees at least 15 days before a change of control, including a bankruptcy filing. This potential bankruptcy announcement comes after PG&E's AIG moment hit late on Thursday, when Moody’s did precisely what S&P did two days earlier, and cut the utility's credit rating to junk citing the electric company’s potential wildfire liabilities. “We see a much more challenging environment for PG&E,” Moody’s analyst Jeff Cassella said in a statement. “The company is increasingly reliant on extraordinary intervention by legislators and regulators , which may not occur soon enough or be of sufficient magnitude to address these adverse developments.” As Bloomberg reports, a notice may signal that the company has accelerated plans to make a Chapter 11 filing as way of dealing with crippling liabilities from wildfires that tore through California in 2017 and 2018, killing over 100 people and destroying hundreds of thousands of acres.","CASH,C",en,Zero Hedge
