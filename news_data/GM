No single victor could satisfy that level of demand. This was obvious even in the early days of the auto industry, when scores of carmakers, engine-makers, and coachbuilders were competing to put Americans and Europeans behind the wheel. Yes, there were obvious winners and losers: Henry Ford captured a huge amount of market share early on with his Model T, then General Motors grew itself into a competitor and took the lead. But more than a century on, both are carrying on, more or less fine. That's not how races work. In the 20th century, plenty of other famous names got in on the action.

Interest pay-out and a significant depreciation cost, however, pulled Kia into a net loss of Rs 326 crore for the year.In the ongoing fiscal 2021, if Kia manages to attain its target of producing 200,000 vehicles, the company may post a turnover of nearly $2.4 billion (Rs 17,000 crore), as per ETIG analysis.It had sold more than 105,000 units in the last fiscal year where exports contributed about a fifth of the total volumes.In a market where global behemoths like General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen struggled to cross a 2-3% market share even after being present for over a decade, Kia has grabbed a 5% market share so far in FY21 and is knocking at the podium just behind Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra.With just three products in its portfolio, which are all utility vehicles, Kia now has a 13-15% market share in the segment.The combined turnover of Kia and sister company Hyundai Motor in India was 63% of market leader Maruti Suzuki's turnover in FY20.",GM,en,Economic Times India

After being snubbed in September, the carmaker has just joined an enviable financial club — and instantly became one of the 10 biggest holdings in the index. The upshot of this momentous event is twofold. First, the short case against Tesla, already shot after the company went on an epic rally at the start of 2020, is now hopeless. Far more investors are going to be passively long Tesla's stock simply because index funds will buy the S&P, and Tesla with it. Second, Tesla's ability to raise additional capital by issuing new shares should encounter little resistance, now that inclusion in the S&P 500 has effectively priced the company to perfection, at a market capitalization of around $400 billion.

We’ll talk to Maxine Joselow, the journalist who reported the story for E&E News over many months. She talked with more than two dozen former GM and Ford employees, retired auto industry executives, academics, and environmentalists about what the companies knew about climate change five decades ago. It leaves the reader wondering: what if automakers had taken the problem more seriously a half-century ago? We are still feeling the ripple effects of investigations five years ago showing that ExxonMobil Corporation’s staff scientists were well aware decades ago that petroleum caused global warming.

By analysing the International Energy Agency's (IEA) business-as-usual scenario, the study calculates that transport in emerging markets accounts for more than 80 per cent of all expected growth in oil demand up to 2030, with half that growth forecast to come from India and China alone. But these countries are already taking steps to reduce their dependence on oil, the report notes, actively supporting EVs and pushing prices for the non-emitting vehicles close to those of their petrol and diesel counterparts. ""China is leading the way"" in EV development, the report states, and ""other markets are poised to follow.""

After more than two decades of hauling mail and packages to American homes and businesses, the U.S. Postal Service is replacing its aging delivery fleet. Mercedes-Benz Metris vans have begun to replace the familiar boxy Grumman Long Life Vehicles in Cedar Rapids. In all, a total of 17,310 Metris vans and more than 7,100 Dodge ProMasters will be swapped out for Grumman LLVs, Chevrolet Uplanders and Dodge Caravans over the next three years The Metris is a right-hand drive van designed and manufactured for commercial use. It is assembled in a Mercedes-Benz factory in Ladson, S.C. “This vehicle was deployed into delivery operations earlier this year, and is equipped with standard safety features such as rear view camera, antilocking brake system, air bags, and anti-collision assist,” said Nicole Hill, communications specialist with the USPS based in Minneapolis, Minn. “The locations for deployment of the Metris are determined based on operational needs.” The Grumman LLVs were built for the USPS and placed in service in the early 1980s.",GM,en,The Gazette Iowa

LG Chem will own 100% of the division for the time being but is planning an initial share sale that would float between 20% and 30% of the unit.The vote is a victory for a LG Chem management that faced opposition to the split from some investors, including second-biggest shareholder National Pension Service with a 10.3% stake. The powerful South Korean pension plan said it viewed the split as unfavorable because it may lessen the company’s value.“If you just look at the business, spinning it off is the best option because it will need more funds for expansion,” said Lee Ji-yeon, an analyst at Shinyoung Securities Co. in Seoul, ahead of the vote. “But the way this was handled has angered many investors,” she said, with reference to the legions of retail shareholders who are also disgruntled.Shares of LG Chem fell 2.6% at 10:40 a.m. in Seoul.",GM,en,Yahoo Finance

Many issues regarding Tesla suspensions were discussed on Twitter and Reddit under the guise of Tesla vehicles having ""whompy wheels"" for the last few years. In fact, suspension issues are one of the oldest ongoing critiques involving Tesla's manufacturing ( before Musk shattered Cybertruck windows live on stage, before Model 3s had dirt collect in their bumper and before Model Ys saw their roofs fly off ). Legacy complaints involving suspension date back years, to Tesla's original run of Model S vehicles. And now, what the NHTSA was too blind to see, the Chinese have clearly noticed. That's why Tesla appears to have been forced into a recall of 30,000 Model S and Model X vehicles made for the Chinese market over suspension issues. Another major issue is whether the recall could prompt a similar recall - that would likely affect over 200,000 vehicles - in the U.S.",GM,en,Zero Hedge

This time, the company slashed prices for its longer-range and performance Model S by 23,000 yuan for each model, according to Bloomberg. Including today's cuts, it is the seventh price cut for Tesla in China alone this year, according to GLJ Research's Gordon Johnson. Perhaps the company's newly released September sales numbers in China were the driving force behind the cuts. As Johnson notes in his latest report on the company from Tuesday, October 13, Tesla actually lost market share in China and unsold inventory doubled. Johnson writes: TSLA sold 11,329 made in China (“MIC”) Model 3 cars in Sep. 2020, bringing quarterly totals to 34,333. This compares to 30,494 in 2Q20, a growth of +12.6%, while production grew 13.2%, and unsold inventory roughly doubled q/q (i.e., up +75.5% q/q). Interestingly, while the Chinese NEV market grew 26% m/m in Sep. 2020 ( link ), TSLA’s MIC M3 sales were down -2% over the same time frame (TSLA’s Model 3 MIC market share fell from 10.5% in Aug. to 8.3% in Sep.).",GM,en,Zero Hedge

The overhaul is so robust that some Wall Street analysts believe Walmart's stock should be treated more like that of a tech company.

2020-09-20 06:14:00-05:00,Wall Street isn't worried about Nikola despite its legal battle. Here's why analysts say the stock could still surge another 60%. (NKLA),"Summary List Placement Nikola, the high-flying electric-truck maker, hasn't seen its stock price recover yet from the damage inflicted by a short-seller earlier this week, but that's not for lack of optimism on Wall Street. Analysts have largely been unswayed in their conviction about the startup, even after it corroborated some of Hindenburg Research's allegations while rebutting its overall thesis. In analysts' eyes, the stock could still have a 60% upside. But that doesn't mean things will be easy. The company hasn't actually sold any trucks yet, and its $2 billion deal with General Motors doesn't actually involve any cash — yet. ""Despite the loud bear noise this week we continue to believe the GM partnership is a huge shot in the arm for Nikola and cements credibility not just for its Badger production slated to begin by the end of 2022 but for its hydrogen fuel cell ambitions and semi truck vision going forward,"" Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, said this week. ""Taking a step back there have been many skeptics around Nikola and its founder Trevor Milton's ambitions over the coming years, which remains the challenge but also the opportunity to execute on its vision now with the stalwart GM partnership a major catalyst,"" he continued. ""For Nikola, this still remains an execution story over the coming years and will be a noisy stock until the EV/hydrogen fuel cell trucks hit the road and deliveries begin to ramp.""

After initially promising a tit-for-tat rebuttal within the day , the company, presumably on the advice of well-heeled counsel, released a full response on Monday to Hindenburg Research's allegations of lies, deception, and outright fraud. For the most part, the company's response flatly denied most of the accusations against it — but many require a little nuance. Perhaps most notably, the company would like you to know that its truck did, in fact, simply roll down a hill for a video shoot. However, the video was not a lie, Nikola said, because it was shot by a third party and never insinuated the truck was actually moving on its own power. As for the other allegations, even Wall Street's top analysts have brushed off most concerns in the Hindenburg allegations, given that they had to do with things that occurred before Nikola's full launch or at founder Trevor Milton's previous companies.",GM,en,Business Insider

Though Tesla's vehicles run on electrons, their body styles resemble those of gas-powered competitors (with the exception of the upcoming Cybertruck pickup truck). The same can be said of newer companies like Rivian and Lucid Motors. Canoo , on the other hand, is making an almost clean break from how car companies operate today. Its debut vehicle has a nearly symmetrical shape that resembles a loaf of bread more than anything you'll find in a dealership. And the only way you'll be able to drive a Canoo (the vehicle shares a name with the company) after its 2022 release is through a subscription that can be canceled at any point after the first month.

The news sent NKLA shares down 4% after hours. Ironically, this means that the company's founder, Trevor Milton, has gotten his wish: Nikola pulled a Wirecard and encouraged the laughably toothless SEC to get involved to settle the report claims. As reported previously, the Phoenix-based company said it reached out to the SEC to discuss its issues with the Hindenburg report, and ultimately held a call with agency officials on the morning of Sept. 11. Nikola says Hindenburg was attempting to profit from a ""manufactured decline"" in its share price.

Crab Mode adds to the long list of impressive features planned for upcoming EV trucks, including the Rivian R1T's ability to spin in a circle with its 360-degree tank turns . It's not clear if a full 90-degree swivel will be possible with the Hummer's crab-walk feature, so those of you waiting on a car that can crawl sideways like the Batmobile might be disappointed.

If anything, she underestimated the pace of the transformation, which has now gone far beyond the car business to encompass trucking, logistics, shipping, aviation, rail, goods delivery, big data, manufacturing, and the final frontier, as SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, and Blue Origin have ushered in the age of private rocketry. ""We are a species that lives in the Space Age, but on a day-to-day basis, most people are unconnected with that,"" Julia Hunter, senior vice president at Virgin Galactic, said. ""Getting a large enough group of people off-world to see the world with their own eyes, and experiencing it, is what the human race needs.""

Electric vehicles seem to be on the forefront of investors' minds, even with few on the market. Stocks may change when some of these companies actually release vehicles. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . Like legendary comedian Rodney Dangerfield, traditional automakers such as General Motors and Ford ""don't get no respect."" Not from Wall Street, anyway. Take GM, which has seen its stock price slide by as much as two-thirds from the $45.88 high it hit as recently as October 2017. The same story can be repeated over and over again with manufacturers like Ford, Volkswagen, BMW, Toyota, and Nissan. On the other hand are the new players, such as Tesla, which has seen a 500% surge in its own stock price since mid-March, while startups like Nikola Motors are being rewarded with market cap numbers in some cases approaching those of legacy automakers — even though they've yet to build a single vehicle.",GM,en,Business Insider

Godrej Appliances, for instance, expects its trade partners to stock up for about 10-15 days based on the demand, while last year it was for a month. “This time, liquidity is the biggest challenge, as consumers would want to save due to lower disposable income,” said Kamal Nandi, business head and executive VP at Godrej Appliances. “The focus will be to offer more flexible finance options, including lower EMIs and down payments.”Fashion retailers, too, are not keen on stockpiling. “We are working to ensure that there is the right inventory at stores.",GM,en,Economic Times India

Why would it? After going nearly straight up for the last five months, it’s only natural for there to be a pullback. This was particularly true for technology stocks. They’d reached such dizzying heights it was just a matter of time before the thin air got to them. And get to them it did. Some of the mania’s favorites, like Apple, Tesla, and Nvida, fainted in unison…dropping 8 percent, 9 percent, and 9.3 percent, respectively. A company called PagerDuty garnered the honor of the day’s biggest loser. The San Francisco based company, which operates in the cloud, made a graceful 25.8 percent swan dive from its heavenly realm. So, what should you do about it? Should you buy the dip? As far as we can tell, there’s currently no fundamental reason to buy stocks.

The $5 billion in new equity the company plans to sell is about twice as much as it has ever issued before (it's an ""at the market"" raise, meaning the shares will be sold over time, at potentially variable prices). The raise should also even out Tesla's cash-to-debt position on its balance sheet, at roughly $14 billion on both sides.

Take General Motors, for example. In early March, the company announced it would have 20 new EVs by 2023. It also is tackling ambitious innovations with its Ultium battery and propulsion system that could enable a GM-estimated range up to 400 miles or more on a full charge with 0 to 60 mile-per-hour acceleration as low as three seconds. And then COVID-19 hit. Sales for all vehicles plummeted. But new consumer revelations were (and are) occurring on a daily basis — and it is good news for the EV market.

The first installment, on how the storage industry has already improved its safety procedures, is available here . The grid battery fire in Arizona last year ended with an explosion, but disagreement has emerged on how exactly it began. Owner Arizona Public Service concluded that a defect in a single lithium-ion battery cell caused it to heat up, triggering a chain reaction that destroyed a whole rack and released gases that later exploded. But LG Chem, the manufacturer responsible for the battery cells and modules, published its own report with a different conclusion. According to LG Chem’s ""progress report,"" compiled by scientific investigation firm Exponent, the physical evidence does not support the battery defect theory. The report , filed with Arizona's utility regulators last month, instead theorizes that external causes heated up the battery.

The company is Wednesday reported a net income of $110m for its second-quarter earnings , with a net profit of $104m - making it eligible to be listed on the S&P 500, the stock market index of 500 of the largest businesses traded in the United States. The move would be more symbolic for Tesla than it would be financially helpful . Although the potential listing is likely contributing to the stock market surge that's seen Tesla's shares rise from a low of around $360 per share in late March to close to $1,600 per share Monday - that's a crazy run, even for Tesla, one of the most volatile stocks out there (although Tesla's stock actually traded lower Thursday, probably because many analysts had already priced the anticipated earnings into their valuations). But the broader symbolism of an S&P listing would be that an all-electric car company has broken through to the mainstream stock index, which includes big automakers such as Ford and GM, oil companies such as Chevron and Exxon and tech companies such as Apple and Facebook.",GM,en,BusinessGreen

These were all male members in their 20s and 30s, the companies told ET.Data centre providers were able to offset the additional expenditure due to a sudden surge in demand for data storage and computing capacity from companies as online traffic and transactions surged during the lockdown. Most commercial data centres saw business grow by 80-100% in the last four months.In some cases, employees of these companies have spent over 100 days away from their home and family, either on-site or at hotels arranged by the company nearby. 77135940While 60%-65% of work at a data centre can be performed remotely, it is critical for some technical and on-site 24x7 to maintain and monitor different parameters that ensure the system works smoothly.“Even if one person were to catch the virus, the rest of the staff on duty would have to be quarantined and the data centre would have to remain shut for a brief period for sanitisation.",GM,en,Economic Times India

Full-size trucks trend toward lifestyle accessories rather than utility vehicles for high-income buyers, so it's most logical for EV companies to build high-priced pickup designs using past drivetrain technology and focusing on sports car feel. Two promising entrants to the electric-truck scene are Rivian and Bollinger, with the Rivian R1T and Bollinger's B2 — both at steep price tags. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . Over the past several years, a shift in full-size truck sales has subtly changed the calculus for both Detroit and Japan's pickup purveyors.

Over the years, it has broadened use of the technology and invested heavily in 3D printing equipment. Last year, it opened the 4,000-square-foot Additive Innovation Lab in Warren, MI. That breadth of expertise and institutional knowledge allowed the automaker to efficiently design the first-ever mid-engine Chevrolet Corvette — in the initial physical version of the car, 75% of the parts were 3D-printed — and to pivot in quite a remarkable fashion to making medical devices and personal protective equipment (PPE). 3D printers from GM's Additive Innovation Lab and Additive Industrialization Center were shipped to its Kokomo, IN, plant to print tools for ventilator production.

Rates are therefore still suppressed, and capacity remains loose. To improve their operations, carriers are accepting almost all contracted loads, optimizing hours of service, and fully utilizing their telematic technology to decrease dwell times.

These markets include Detroit, Michigan; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Wilmington, North Carolina; and El Paso, Texas. The El Paso market shows increasing volumes and tender rejections, since there's ongoing cross-border activity there, and a good portion of it is long-haul freight from the automotive industry. In Detroit, automotive production similarly plays a role in its recent activity.

While Tesla has developed an edge in advanced driver-assistance technology, its cars don't have the hardware necessary to turn Autopilot into a fully autonomous system, said Carnegie Mellon professor Raj Rajkumar. Tesla did not respond to request for comment on this story. Are you a current or former Tesla employee? Do you have an opinion about what it's like to work there?

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has acted swiftly as lender of last resort. It has mandated loan moratoria, injected enormous liquidity into the financial system, and joined hands with the Centre to guarantee a wide range of loans.Next, we must plan for a terrible year ahead in which GDP falls by 5% or more, the most calamitous collapse since 1929. Bankruptcies galore are inevitable, including very big ones. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has proved very tardy in old cases and cannot possibly cope with the coming flood of major bankruptcies.Veni, Vidi, VCJeremy Stein of Harvard University recently proposed an appealing solution in a Princeton webinar. In most recessions, the central bank acts as lender of last resort, flooding the financial system with money to revive companies suffering from illiquidity, as distinct from insolvency. But in a megarecession, such as the 2008 Great Recession, a lender of last resort may not be enough.",GM,en,Economic Times India

As high-profile companies like Shell and General Motors announce dividend cuts and suspensions, it points to a greater trend of uncertainty in the market, he says, as this year alone, more companies have suspended or cancelled their dividends than in the past 10 years combined. “It is important for investors to consider both the short and long-term view of the dividend space right now,” Huemmer says, commenting that dividend policies are now facing both macro-economic and regulatory pressures. “With interest rates so low there will be a demand for investors who need income and need to look further than fixed income to meet their income goals, so it’s important to focus on the dividend space today and the quality of dividends.” The macro economic environment has seen economies being effectively shut down around the world and this has had a particular impact on companies that have a lack of cash flow or whose operations are being hindered by the pandemic.",GM,en,ETF Express

This has led to several consequences that we have been documenting at length here on Zero Hedge. The main consequence is that auto dealers are losing billions of dollars in fleet sales , which we documented just last week. Fleet sales account for 1.7 million vehicles per year, or about 10% of total U.S. auto sales. Another consequence is that rental car companies have nowhere to store their inventories. Parking lots across the U.S. are full of rental cars, forcing some rental car companies to even rent out the parking lots of unused sports stadiums to store their cars. This, combined with a massive demand drop off, has led to a massive inventory glut for auto dealers, who are being forced to consider major incentives across the board to try and sell vehicles when the consumer makes their way back to the showroom.",GM,en,Zero Hedge

The collapse is coming as a result of used vehicle auctions grinding to a halt - along with the rest of the country - and vehicles piling up at places where buyers and sellers transact secondhand cars, according to Bloomberg . A price drop in used vehicles could be another headwind for automakers and their lending units, which could be forced to write down the value of lease contracts that had previously assumed vehicles would retain more value. GM, for example, has $30.4 billion worth of leased vehicles on its books at the end of last year. Every 100 bps it has to raise its estimate for depreciation costs the company $304 million.

Total EV sales will plunge 43 percent in 2020, according to new research from Wood Mackenzie. The 2020s are the decade in which EVs are expected to move from the margin of the global auto market to its fast lane, as battery pack prices tumble, driving ranges extend, and charging infrastructure becomes more sophisticated and widespread. But the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic shockwaves have not made for a good start. WoodMac now expects global EV sales of 1.3 million units in 2020, nosediving from a record 2.2 million sales last year. Coronavirus deserves much of the blame. In China, the world’s largest EV market, sales of all types of cars fell 21 percent in January compared to last year, and by an eye-watering 80 percent in February. Things were even worse for EVs, with February sales projected to be down more than 90 percent. “Most new EV buyers are still first-time owners of the technology,” Ram Chandrasekaran, principal analyst for transportation and mobility at Wood Mackenzie, said in a research note. “The uncertainty and fear created by the outbreak has made consumers less inclined to adopt a new technology.” “Once the epidemic is contained in China, we suspect consumers will flock back to car dealers and reaffirm their confidence in EVs.” The bounce-back could take longer in Europe and North America, where the COVID-19 outbreak is several months behind China. “The first lockdown in the U.S. did not start until March 20, but the effects have already begun to show in EV sales,” Chandrasekaran said. “General Motors is offering a discount of $10,000 for its Chevrolet Bolt.",GM,en,Green Technology

Thus, Chrysler — now called Fiat Chrysler — created the minivan segment as we know it. The minivan market has since declined from its 2000 peak, but FCA still holds a firm grip on it to this day. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . In May, Fiat Chrysler will end production of the Dodge Grand Caravan — the minivan that many say started it all. The minivan segment roared from the 1980s through 2000, when minivan sales hit their peak. They've declined steadily since, and many manufacturers have ducked out of the market in favor of the new boom: crossovers and SUVs. But minivans had a strong run, even if the market has shrunk in the past couple of decades, and the Dodge Caravan kicked that run off when it rolled off of the line in 1983.",GM,en,Business Insider

But Tesla has never been priced as high as it is now: even after a 20% bear correction, it's still over $700. Playing the Tesla-volatility game has become a lot more expensive. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . Tesla has always been a volatile stock. But in the good old days of 2019, you could buy all that risk-on volatility for a relatively cheap price — relative to what Tesla has been trading at lately. Over the last few weeks, some investors have bought Tesla shares at close to $1,000. Sellers might have been in the stock since it was around $200, so one can easily understand why those folks who quadrupled their money would want to head for the profitable exits. Meanwhile, the latecomers are betting on a future in which Tesla manages to vindicate a market capitalization that adds up to four General Motors. (GM, by the way, made over $8 billion last year and sold about 8 million vehicles worldwide, while Tesla finished 2019 in the red and sold around 370,000 cars.) The latecomers are now in a world of hurt as Tesla swiftly entered a bear correction sliding 30% in a week.",GM,en,Business Insider

FDA has contacted all of the manufacturers, said Hahn, adding that several of the facilities in China are adversely affected by COVID-19, including by quarantined workers.

Operating profits for 2019 are estimated at $2,065 billion, off 0.5% from the prior year total, and extend the streak of annual declines in operating profits to 5, making it the longest stretch of consecutive annual declines in the post-period surpassing the prior record of 4 at the end of the 1990s.

2020-02-08 10:00:06-05:00,What Tesla Investors Can Learn From Where GM Was 100 Years Ago,"Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) shares have been on fire in recent weeks, sparking a heated debate between Tesla bulls and bears as to whether the stock is a compelling long-term value or a mania-driven bubble. DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas took a fundamental look at where Tesla stands today compared to where auto giant General Motors Company (NYSE: GM ) was nearly 100 years ago. The Numbers Colas compared Tesla’s current numbers to a GM financial report from 1932. At that point, GM had been around for 24 years, eight years longer than Tesla is today. “General Motors back then was much like Tesla today; a driving force in developing an important new technology,” Colas said. However, there are several key differences. The most obvious difference is that GM’s stock was never as expensive as Tesla’s is today, even during the peak of the Roaring 20s stock market prior to the 1929 crash. GM’s Roaring 20s peak share price was $92 and market cap was $4 billion. Adjusted for inflation, GM’s peak valuation was $60 billion, less than half of Tesla’s $135 billion market cap today.",GM,en,Benzinga Feeds

Tesla shares were last up 1.4 per cent at $555 after trading was closed on Tuesday, reports CNBC. The milestone came less than a month after Tesla's stock crossed $420 -- a price Musk tweeted last year which put him in much trouble. The $100 billion valuation must stay for both one-month and six-month average in order to help Musk get first of 12 tranches of $346 million in a record-breaking pay package. Tesla is currently valued more than Ford Motor and General Motors combined. Musk lost his position as Tesla Chairman after posting a notorious tweet in August last year that he was ""considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured"". The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk over the tweet, saying he misled investors by claiming falsely he had lined up funding for the take-private transaction. Musk reached a settlement with the SEC, agreeing to give up his role as Tesla Chairman and pay a $20 million fine.",GM,en,Sify.com

Whoever planned Ghosn's escape was likely skilled, Tulane professor and security expert Robert Allen said, but this probably wasn't the work of a reputable security company, which would not want to risk the reputational damage resulting from a botched operation. To pull off this kind of high-stakes endeavor, you need to plan it in a way that minimizes your odds of being detected. That means traveling at night and using a private airport, Allen said. While Allen said it is difficult to determine how much money the operation might have cost, he estimated it fell somewhere in the range of a few million dollars. There has been speculation that Ghosn was transported inside a container of some kind. That scenario would make sense, Allen said, as the alternative, using a disguise, would not hold up to serious scrutiny.

El paró le costó a la empresa una pérdida de beneficio de cerca de 3.000 millones de dólares y consiguió algunas mejoras laborales para los trabajadores, aunque no cambiar el problema estructural para la plantilla estadounidense: evitar que buena parte de la producción se desplace a economías más baratas, como México. Quien navegó al sindicato hacia esa movilización brutal fue Gary Jones, un veterano sindical que ascendió a presidente de la organización este mismo año.

(AMZN),"Amazon has grown its business almost 10 times over in the past 10 years. Founded primarily as an online retailer, Amazon has bulked up its physical retail operations in the US and across the globe in the past decade. Amazon also bet heavily on its web services in the 2010s, which has proved highly lucrative for the company. Here's how Amazon's priorities and scope have transformed over the past decade. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. In a letter to investors in 2010, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos outlined the threats that he predicted the company would have to contend with as it plotted its future. Amazon might not be successful expanding internationally, he wrote . It still needed to figure out how to optimize and operate its fulfillment centers. And as the company grew, Bezos predicted, it would have to contend with increasing scrutiny and taxation from governments at home and abroad. More broadly, Bezos wrote that Amazon's ambitions were largely uncharted territory, making it impossible to predict exactly what the company's future would hold. ""Many of the problems we face have no textbook solutions,"" Bezos wrote. ""And so we — happily — invent new approaches."" For the most part, the bets that Amazon took paid off throughout the 2010s.",GM,en,Business Insider

The seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) is forecast to finish near 16.9 million, up from last month's strike-impacted 16.5 million level, but down slightly from the current 2019 year-to-date pace near 17.0 million. Total sales through October 2019 are down 1.4% compared to last year, and this negative trend is expected to continue. Sales volume, supported by an extra selling day, is expected to finish down 0.4% compared to November 2018 . Sales, however, will be up nearly 4% from last month. One key factor will be incentives, which generally rise at the end of the year as OEMs try to push old inventory to make way for new products. Black Friday and year-end sales promotions have become an important part of the sell-down strategy and are even more important in a downward moving retail market. (For more perspective on sales incentives, see this Data Point in the Cox Automotive Newsroom: Year-End Incentive Complexity Is A Real Grinch .)

Of course, GM, along with every other vehicle manufacturer in the world, will not be shunning plastic materials any time soon.

Fiat Chrysler wollte sich bereits im Frühjahr mit dem französischen Hersteller Renault verbinden und den weltweit drittgrößten Autohersteller formieren. Die Gespräche scheiterten jedoch. Wie das ""Wall Street Journal"" am Dienstag berichtet hatte, wären Fiat Chrysler und der Opel-Mutterkonzern PSA an der Börse rund 50 Milliarden Dollar (45 Milliarden Euro) wert. PSA führt auch die Traditionsmarken Peugeot und Citroën. Fiat Chrysler hat die Marken Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Lancia oder Maserati unter seinem Dach. Autohersteller stehen heutzutage unter einem riesigen Druck, denn sie müssen in autonome Autos und Elektromobilität investieren.",GM,de,Volksstimme.de
2019-10-30 03:54:16-05:00,Milliardenfusion: Fiat verhandelt mit Peugeot,"Aus dem Zusammenschluss könnte ein neuer Autogigant im Wert von 45 Milliarden Euro entstehen. Fiat Chrysler hat harte Zeiten hinter sich. Den Wandel in der Automobilindustrie hat der italienisch-amerikanische Konzern - kurz FCA genannt - lange verschlafen, bei neuen Technologien zu sehr gezaudert: So baut FCA serienmäßig bisher weder Elektroautos noch Hybrid-Modelle. Eines der Erfolgsmodelle, der Fiat 500 City Car, rollte auch schon vor zwölf Jahren das erste Mal vom Band. In China , dem größten Automarkt weltweit, ist der siebtgrößte Autobauer so gut wie nicht präsent. Auch in Europa schwächelt das Geschäft. Und selbst die sagenumwobene Marke Alfa Romeo hat das Unternehmen bisher nicht sichtbar wiederbeleben können: Im ersten Halbjahr 2019 fielen die Verkaufszahlen von Alfa in Europa um mehr als 40 Prozent. Fiat selbst verkaufte 10 Prozent weniger. Den Gewinn macht Fiat Chrysler in den Staaten: Dank der starken Nachfrage nach seinen Jeep-Geländefahrzeugen und Ram-Pick-ups stammen mehr als 90 Prozent des Gewinns aus dem Nordamerika-Geschäft.",GM,de,Kurier.at

But, the company's third quarter results easily beat up estimates despite the $1 billion strike cost for the quarter. This national strike was the longest in almost 50 years. As a consequence, the company has lowered its guidance for the year as the strike's cost was significantly higher than expected. Third Quarter Results Revenue of $35.47 billion exceeded the forecasts of $33.82 billion resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $1.72 versus the expected $1.31. The strike has taken 52% per share of the company's earnings whereas the revaluation of its investment in Lyft Inc (NASDAQ: LYFT ) and warrants from PSA Group deducted an additional 15 cents per share.

For example, do we know if a faster adoption of EVs would be in India’s interest? Is the currently used EV technology robust enough? Will EVs make us dependent on China?Answers are straightforward. We just need to look at the most critical part of an EV – the battery. What the internal combustion engine is to a petrol car, the battery is to EV. Currently, all EVs use lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). It is the limitations of LIBs that will prevent widespread adoption of EVs. LIBs are expensive and do not support longdistance travel. Worse, raw materials needed to make LIBs are in short supply. Let us understand the seriousness of the issue.The battery used in a typical EV is a massive 500 kg pack consisting of hundreds of large lithium-ion cells that use metals like lithium, cobalt, nickel and manganese. Each metal serves a useful purpose. For example, lithium generates a flow of electrons and helps charge the battery.",GM,en,The Economic Times India

2019-04-30 23:01:17-05:00,Zalando Brings Massive CEO Compensation Packages to Germany,"(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- Thrift and discretion have traditionally been seen as virtues in Germany—even in executive suites. Companies long resisted publishing individual compensation of top managers, whose pay is often a fraction of what many of their global peers receive. German chief executive officers rarely get more than €10 million ($11.2 million) annually. Volkswagen AG paid its CEO around €8 million last year, less than half the $22 million Mary Barra made at General Motors Co., even though VW’s sales are almost twice the size of GM’s. And on average, German leaders earn 97 times as much as employees, vs. 312 times as much at the biggest U.S. companies, according to the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. Yet a trio of German millennials could upend the status quo—and become Europe’s highest-paid executives in the process.

Macklowe, 81, hasn’t paid income tax since the 1980s, according to a court opinion in his divorce proceedings issued in December. The ruling, which also divided luxury homes and an art collection worth more than $650 million between Macklowe and his ex-wife, Linda, doesn’t suggest the couple did anything wrong to avoid paying income taxes. Rather, it highlights the special perks available to property investors in the U.S.—advantages that have expanded under the tax law signed in 2017 by Donald Trump, America’s real estate developer president. “The real estate industry is notorious for throwing off lots of deductions, and real estate developers are notorious for paying very few taxes,” says Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

Three had dropped the Fiat brand from their stores—including the one that originally leased him the car. “We had this orphaned car in our driveway that we needed to bring back, with no dealership willing to take it in,” says Kim. “It was such a weird and bizarre situation.” Kim’s troubles are a sign of just how much Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’s American experiment with stylish Italian microcars has failed to live up to expectations. Fiat brand sales in the U.S. peaked at about 46,000 in 2014, with the addition of the roomier 500L, and have been in free fall ever since. They were down 45 percent year-over-year in the first quarter of 2019, after a 41 percent plunge last year to 15,521, the lowest level since the brand’s reintroduction to the U.S. in 2011.

2019-03-25 05:00:20-05:00,What First Responders Don’t Know About Fiery Electric Vehicles,"(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- After an out-of-control Tesla Model S plowed into a stand of palm trees on a highway median outside Fort Lauderdale last month, police rushed to put out the ensuing blaze using a department-issued fire extinguisher. It was a wasted effort. The car kept on burning after the crash, which killed the driver. The police may not have known lithium-ion batteries inside electric vehicles, once ignited, can’t be put out with chemicals from a conventional extinguisher. The battery fires are susceptible to a self-destructive chain reaction known as thermal runaway, causing a feedback loop of rising temperatures.

Ride-hailing titan Uber is close to accepting a $1 billion investment for its autonomous vehicle (AV) project from Japanese telecom Softbank and Toyota, according to Venture Beat. The investment will reportedly be finalized within the next month. Both companies are already Uber investors: Softbank has been Uber's largest shareholder since last year, and Toyota invested $500 million in Uber last year and agreed to co-develop certain self-driving technologies with the company. The news of the significant capital injection indicates that Uber is intent on developing its own self-driving tech as opposed to bringing third-party AVs into its fleet.

To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here . Waymo, Alphabet's autonomous vehicle (AV) technology spinoff, is seeking outside investors for the first time, according to TechCrunch. The company is reportedly looking to secure an investment from German auto giant Volkswagen (VW) and is aiming for any cash injection to value it at ""well north of $15 billion,"" the most recent valuation of Cruise, GM's AV business unit. Any stake that Waymo sells to another investor would be less than 20% of the company. Waymo follows other AV companies in considering investments from third parties to alleviate the massive costs required to build AV technologies. Uber's self-driving project got an injection of $500 million in cash from Toyota last year, while Softbank poured $2.25 billion into Cruise. Still, AV companies are racking up significant losses without the promise of any near-term revenues: GM's Cruise unit lost $728 million last year, 19% more than it shed in 2017, while Uber's AV unit loses between $125 and $200 million a quarter and is responsible for 15-30% of Uber's quarterly losses.",GM,en,Business Insider

The competition has been pressuring revenue since 2013 and is only getting stronger. 2018 used-vehicle values were as good as it’s going to get. Airline passenger volume falls during recessions and 68% of Hertz’s revenue comes from airport locations. In a recent interview with Real Vision, I identified Hertz as a good short target. Since the interview, Hertz reported Q4 and full-year earnings (or lack thereof) that were above analyst estimates causing the stock to rally. Most of the improvement that took analysts by surprise was due to the abnormally strong performance in used-vehicle values during 2018 which dropped Hertz’s used-vehicle depreciation per unit by 16% on a year-over-year basis. So is all of the pessimism surrounding Hertz overdone and should the 2018 results be the all-clear signal to buy? Let’s let’s take a closer look.

My responsibility is to help you answer that question, and I’ll do so with the aid of proprietary indicators that I have developed to very accurately forecast volume and margin for several companies in the automotive sector.

Despite the fact that they were crippling traditional sedan sales, Americans' transition to SUVs was seen as a silver lining, prompting many automakers to make infrastructure changes to account for the change in demand. Those days, however, seem to be over, according to the latest, February U.S. auto sales data. Fiat Chrysler posted its first monthly sales decline in a year, according to Bloomberg . The kicker? Jeep, the company's driving force for the past several years, showed a rare back-to-back drop in deliveries. Charlie Chesbrough, senior economist of Cox Automotive said: “ The results today suggest a much bigger story: The sales pace has finally shifted into a lower gear.” The fact that Jeep sales have slowed is a warning indicator that the SUV ""boom"" in the U.S. could be coming to an end. Mired by higher interest rates and continued tightening of credit, buyers are forcing once record high SUV sales and prices back down again.",GM,en,Zero Hedge

Layoffs recently ""quietly begun"", according to additional reporting from Reuters. Neither Ford nor its China JV, formed in partnership with Changan Automobile Group, had a comment on the reported layoffs Wednesday morning. Car sales in China continued their relentless descent in January, falling 17.7%, as we recently expected would happen when discussing Europe's tumbling January auto sales.

Buffett continued to bid up bank shares, making his Omaha-based firm a major shareholder in four of the five largest US banks. This includes increasing stakes in JP Morgan and Bank of America during the last three months of the year. Buffett also boosted his stakes in regional lenders like PNC Financial Services Group and US Bancorp which may have been plays on consolidation in the industry (a trend that is starting to play out following the recent BB&T-Suntrust deal ). And while bank stocks have rallied during the opening weeks of the year during one of the biggest market rebounds in recent memory, Buffett unexpectedly cut his stake in Apple.",GM,en,Zero Hedge

2019-01-29 15:39:20-05:00,Is Tesla's Growth Story About To Die A Sudden Death,"With Tesla set to report earnings, bulls are more nervous than they have been in a while and the main reason for rising concerns, as Vertical Group's Gordon Johnson explains, is that the company recently guided 4Q margins lower despite higher 4Q shipments. As Johnson elaborates, despite TSLA: guiding ’18 CAPEX to cutting 7% of its workforce this past Fri. (after cutting 9% of its employees Jun. ’18, where E. Musk boldly predicted the company would “never have to do this again”), ending its referral program (which was seen as providing “endless” demand at no marketing cost), and killing its entry level 75kWh Model S & X (which accounted for ~80% of all Model S/Xs sold in ’18), … all of which portend slowing growth the bull case on TSLA still centered on the thought that the more Model 3s produced the higher company margins would ascend. Yet, as detailed here , despite deliveries growing +8.6% q/q in 4Q18, Musk expects 4Q18 GAAP profit to lag that reported in 3Q18. Or said otherwise, ""while still trading at a forward P/S multiple of ~2x (vs. 0.37x for GM), the TSLA “growth narrative” appears to have died a sudden death. "" So after declaring that the Tesla growth story has seemingly ended with a whmper, Johnson provides his Tesla model update, where he highlights the following key highlights: We see a Modest EPS Miss in 4Q18, Followed by a Sizeable EPS/Delivery Miss in 1Q19.",GM,en,Zero Hedge

2019-01-03 12:07:42-05:00,Ford Will Stop Reporting Monthly Sales Data After Sales Plunge 9%,"Capping what has been an abysmal year for the global automobile market and starting off what Morgan Stanley predicts to be another coming awful year for the industry, Ford reported that its sales for December were down 9%. Ford's fleet sales and car sales both cratered, falling well into the double digits, or -19.5% and -27.8%, respectively. And it looks as though Tim Cook isn’t the only one not especially excited about giving up on transparency heading into the back end of a decade-long artificial bull market. Taking a page out of General Motors' book, Ford announced that they were no longer going to report monthly sales data and will be moving to reporting sales data on a quarterly basis instead. As a reminder, when General Motors changed its reporting of sales, it hilariously stated that reducing its disclosures would ""give a more accurate view of its business operations"". ""Thirty days is not enough time to separate real sales trends from short-term fluctuations in a very dynamic, highly competitive market,"" Kurt McNeil, GM's U.S.",GM,en,Zero Hedge
