2020-07-09 09:19:58-05:00,Cargo-Friendly Airports Shine During COVID Crisis,"Secondary airports geared toward cargo are proving their value during the coronavirus pandemic as a faster alternative for delivering goods. Airports outside major metro areas have always had a speed advantage over international passenger gateways such as Chicago O'Hare and New York's JFK airport. An onslaught of freighter aircraft full of medical supplies for the COVID response has magnified congestion at those hubs and forced shippers to consider other options. Good infrastructure, customer service, longer operating hours and priority clearance from customs authorities make it easier to pick up inbound shipments at second-tier airports, freight transportation specialists say. Rickenbacker International Airport outside Columbus, Ohio, exemplifies the cargo-centric approach. The airport authority services parked freighters to expedite loading and unloading, or airlines can self-handle cargo. Several freight forwarders have airside cargo terminals, giving them direct control over their freight compared to using a third-party for disassembling and preparing loads for pick up.",ANF,en,Benzinga Feeds
