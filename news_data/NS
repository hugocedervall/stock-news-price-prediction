Among the participants were railroaders David LeVan and Al Braverman. Strategic planner Jim McClellan confided that he also probed the changing landscape. Coal's possible decline was a factor in Norfolk Southern's (NS) market diversification strategy and the acquisition of Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail).
