The PlayStation 5 continues to sell out in seconds in the US and the UK as retailers drop new stock, some bought by bots that purchased them faster than any human could. Pent up demand may have been responsible for repeatedly crashing Walmart's website in November, Ben Gilbert reported. One reseller group told Business Insider that it bought 3,500 consoles, and resellers said that they were selling $500 PlayStations for as much as $1,100. The consoles are such a hot commodity that they were the hot item on Black Friday , despite not being discounted at all.

2020-11-27 18:18:08-05:00,Microsoft is trying to figure out why PS5 games outperform Xbox Series X games,"In early testing, PS5 games look better and run more smoothly than Xbox Series X games. Microsoft says that the Xbox Series X is ""the world's most powerful console,"" but many multiplatform games are performing better on the PlayStation 5. Microsoft is working with its Xbox development partners to address these discrepancies. One of the more compelling mysteries heading into this video game console generation concerned the power of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Which console would have the edge? The raw numbers pointed to the Xbox Series X coming out on top -- which explains why Microsoft calls it ""the world's most powerful console"" -- but the early tests seem to suggest that the PS5 is actually outperforming its next-generation rival. While the PS5 has a number of exclusive launch titles that debuted alongside the console on November 12th, many of the biggest games of the fall are available on both PS5 and Xbox Series X. The problem for Xbox fans is that most of those games appear to be running better on Sony's console than on Microsoft's.",SNE,en,BGR

2020-11-20 19:55:04-05:00,How to fix the PS5 download queue bug without a factory reset,"PS5 ""Queued for Download"" bug has a solution that doesn't require a factory reset. If you're having trouble downloading games or apps on your new PS5, try starting up in safe mode and rebuilding the database, which PlayStation Support suggests in a tweet. Sony has yet to announce when or if a software update will permanently fix this bug. Shortly after the PlayStation 5 launched in the US and other regions last week, early adopters began reporting a bug that was affecting their ability to download games on the new console. A number of PS5 owners discovered that when they hit the Download button for select games and apps on the PlayStation Store or in the Game Library, the console would either say it was ""Queued for Download"" and never actually start downloading the files, or the download would suffer an error before it even started. Either way, it became impossible to download that game or app. This would have been problematic enough on its own, but to make matters worse, the only way to address the issue seemed to be to initiate a factory reset, wiping everything from the affected PlayStation 5 and starting from scratch.",SNE,en,BGR

The announcement of a follow-up starring Parker’s understudy Miles Morales caused great excitement in June, but that soured a little when developer Insomniac clarified that it would be a spin-off rather then a sequel – a shorter, alternative take on the original, but at full price. Anyone who played 2018’s game should be advised that from the combat to Manhattan itself, many elements are exactly the same. But although Miles Morales is definitely more condensed than its predecessor, it is hugely enjoyable and even moving in its own right. Peter Parker is off on holiday for a few weeks, leaving young Miles to protect New York as a sort of substitute-teacher Spider-Man.",SNE,en,The Guardian

But the company has squandered goodwill before at the launch of a machine: it followed up the beloved PlayStation 2 with an awkward-looking, difficult-to-develop-for console that cost the equivalent of £600 in today’s money. It took PlayStation 3 almost a decade and several remodels to make up the ground it had lost. The PlayStation 5 certainly looks wild next to the modernist oblong that is PS4, but this is no conceptual experiment in hardware design. It is a console that wants to make you feel good, to celebrate the time, money and passion we expend on video games. The console itself is a statement object. Standing vertically, its white casing tapers to a V around the shiny black body of the machine.",SNE,en,The Guardian

The 25th James Bond movie was supposed to premiere in April, but the release date kept being pushed back because of the novel coronavirus. The film is now set to launch in April 2021, assuming the health crisis is under control by then. A new rumor says that Apple and Netflix are involved in a bidding war for No Time to Die , which might bring the highly-anticipated James Bond movie to streaming services instead of theaters. No Time to Die , Daniel Craig’s final James Bond film, was supposed to be one of this year’s biggest blockbusters. The film was supposed to premiere on April 10th, but then the novel coronavirus reached pandemic status, and the world shut down. Universal had to delay the release, pushing it back to November 20th, hoping that the health crisis would be solved by then. But it was clear a few months ago that the pandemic is here to stay. Several studios postponed their biggest 2020 films, and No Time to Die was pushed back to April 2nd, 2021.",SNE,en,BGR

In the space of nine months between November 2019 and July 2020, four major subscription video services will have come to market from traditional US media companies and tech giants, with Disney, AT&T/WarnerMedia, and Comcast/NBCUniversal (NBCU) each having launched its own major branded streaming service: Disney+, HBO Max, and Peacock, respectively.

2020-10-23 15:32:25-05:00,You can already buy an awesome PS5 accessory that the Xbox Series X will never have,"PS5 custom faceplates have been rumored ever since the console's design was revealed, but one third-party company has actually started selling them. PlateStation 5 sells PS5 faceplates in matte black, cherry red, chromatic, indigo blue, and jungle camo. Each of the custom plates costs $39.99, and should arrive by the PS5's release date on November 12th. When Sony first revealed the design of the PlayStation 5 back in June, there was some speculation that the massive white plates that covered the sides of the console would be replaceable. A PlayStation executive stoked those flames by revealing in a Q&A session on LinkedIn that the PS5 would be ""customizable in ways previous gens weren’t."" Our suspicions were finally confirmed when Sony shared an official PS5 teardown video a few weeks ago. As we see in the video, the side panels of the PS5 can be removed without any tools. All you need to do is lift up on the plastic at the top of each panel and slide it off of the console. This will be necessary if you plan to add storage to your PS5, as the M.2 expansion slot for NVMe SSD drives sits beneath one of the panels.",SNE,en,BGR

One of the more frustrating and perplexing things about owning an Xbox One for the past seven years has been the lack of an official solution for playing those games on iOS devices.

2020-10-14 21:02:31-05:00,We finally know why the PS5 is so enormous,"Sony's PS5 is one of the biggest video game consoles of all time, and now we finally know why. According to one of the lead engineers behind the PlayStation 5, the cooling fan determined the size of the console, as one large fan was preferable to two smaller fans. Sony could have made a smaller console by using two fans, but the PS5 might have been more expensive to make as a result, and thus would have cost more at retail as well. Sony finally showed us the design of the PS5 during its Future of Gaming event, but we walked away with nearly as many questions as we had going in. We still didn't know the price, the release date, which games would be available on day one, or what the user interface would look like. Many of those mysteries have been solved, but this week, we finally got an answer to the most important question of all: Why is the PS5 so dang huge? In an interview with Nikkei Xtech on Tuesday, Yasuhiro Ootori, the Sony Interactive Entertainment VP of mechanical design (who you might remember from that PS5 teardown video ), explained that the cooling fan is the culprit behind the PS5's considerable bulk.",SNE,en,BGR

2020-10-09 14:43:00-05:00,Aukey EP-N5 review: Entry-level ANC that gets it (mostly) right,"Not too long ago, you would have been right to doubt the quality of any true wireless earbuds with active noise canceling selling for less than $100. The $60 Aukey EP-N5 thus serve as a pleasant reminder that the technology is no longer as out of reach as it once was. These buds still fall short in features like mic quality and water resistance when compared to pricier competition from the likes of Apple, Samsung, and Sony, but they’re worth checking out if you’re hunting for good sound and decent ANC above all else. Note: This review is part of our roundup of wireless and true wireless earbuds . Go there for details on competing products and our testing methods. From a distance, the EP-N5 earbuds look even more expensive than they actually are, in part because the design of both the case and buds pulls so heavily from Apple’s AirPods and AirPods Pro—save for the fact that they only come in black. The difference in build quality is more apparent once they’re actually in your hands, as Aukey crafted them with a lightweight plastic that doesn’t feel super durable but does help keep them comfortable when worn for hours at a time.",SNE,en,Macworld

It’s a struggle across the industry, with new players giving power back to artists In September, Kanye West took to Twitter to declare the music industry (and NBA) “modern day slave ships”, as he sought to regain the rights to his master recordings. He explained: “When you sign a music deal you sign away your rights. Without the masters you can’t do anything with your own music. Someone else controls where it’s played and when it’s played. Artists have nothing accept [ sic ] the fame, touring and merch.” For West, owning his masters, some of which are held by label Universal Music and publisher Sony/ATV, is personal. “My children will own my own masters, not your children, my children,” he followed up. Since then, West has pledged that all artists signed to his own GOOD Music label will get back the 50% share he holds in their masters. He’s also proposed an eight-point plan for revolutionising the music industry that focuses on master ownership, short-term deals, an 80/20 split of royalty payments in the artist’s favour (it’s traditionally been the other way around) and transparency.",SNE,en,The Guardian

The Spider-Man sequel is scheduled to hit theaters on December 17th, 2021.

The multiverse is key to some of the craziest storylines in the history of Marvel comics, and the Doctor Strange sequel could lay the groundwork for the future of the movie franchise. But it sounds like Doctor Strange will have even more responsibility than fans might have expected. According to The Hollywood Reporter , Benedict Cumberbatch will reprise his role as the caped magician for the next Spider-Man movie as well.

The air-cargo industry is planning to ship up to 20 billion doses of a COVID-19 vaccination, according to a new report from Doug Cameron at the Wall Street Journal . But without knowing how many doses they'll actually need to ship, where they will be made, and how they will need to be stored during transit, there is only so much that carriers can figure out ahead of time. Complicating matters is a reduction in cargo-hold freight capacity on passenger airliners, with many airlines cutting routes and frequencies during the pandemic; increased demand for shipping as people continue to work from home and avoid non-essential trips; and the coming peak shipping season that runs from fall until February. According to the Journal, space on scheduled cargo flights is already filling up through February, with holiday shopping and consumer electronics leading the demand.",SNE,en,Business Insider

2020-09-29 15:51:42-05:00,Some customers are going to have to wait until 2021 to get their PS5 preorders,"PS5 preorder customers are being told that they might not receive their consoles until 2021. GameStop Ireland is the latest retailer to tell customers that placed PS5 or PS5 Digital Edition preorders that they won't get their console on time when it launches in November. There's a chance that more PS5 preorders could become available within the next month. At long last, Sony announced the price and release date of the PlayStation 5 on Wednesday, September 16th. The company also revealed that preorders for its next-generation console would begin on Thursday, September 17th, but on Wednesday evening, preorders suddenly began springing up without any notice. It was an unmitigated disaster as websites were overwhelmed and PS5 consoles went in and out of stock all night. Sony issued an apology and made more preorders available, but it looks like the full scope of the fallout is still coming to light. According to Video Games Chronicle , some GameStop Ireland customers have been received notices that the store “won’t be able to fulfill your pre-order until 2021.” The notice also claims that the delay is “due to circumstances out of our control,” and gives customers the option to cancel their preorder and get a refund.",SNE,en,BGR

Her first memoir reveals her to be not just in on the joke, but peeling back the layers to deconstruct it. Because, for all the dry humour that flashes through The Meaning of Mariah Carey, it is not the glitzy, gossipy celebrity reminiscence some might expect, but instead a largely sombre dive into her past that, at times, feels like therapy. Indeed, Carey says as much: “Singing was a form of escapism for me, and writing was a form of processing.” In this memoir, Carey processes her chaotic upbringing and troubled family relationships, her scrappy rags-to-riches entry into the music industry, and the gilded cage of her first marriage, to former Sony CEO Tommy Mottola in the 1990s, which she describes as emotionally abusive.",SNE,en,The Guardian

Sony conceded that the PS5 will not run PS3, PS2, or PS1 games, as it did not have time to implement the feature. The PS5 will run 99% of the existing PS4 collection.

Sony confirmed earlier this week that the PlayStation 5 will run 99% of PS4 games without addressing older hardware in the process. The new Xbox Series X and Series S can run not only all Xbox One games but also older games that were created for Xbox 360 and the original Xbox. That seemed to be a massive win for Microsoft, especially if you're the kind of gamer who owns a considerable collection of games, or who wants to try older games on the new system.

2020-09-18 03:36:30-05:00,Sony launches new over-ear headphones in India,"New Delhi, Sep 18 (IANS) Sony on Friday launched the latest over-ear headphones in India for Rs 29,990. According to the company, the 'WF-1000XM3' headphones can be paired with two Bluetooth devices at the same time. The feature allows the headphones to switch between two devices quickly and smoothly. The headphones can detect which device is ringing when the user receives a call and switches to the right one automatically. ""These headphones are designed for those who travel frequently, the super-soft, pressure-relieving ear pads evenly distribute pressure and increase ear/pad contact for a stable fit,"" the company said in a statement. The headphones feature two microphones on each earcup, which are used for noise canceling. The Dual Noise Sensor technology captures ambient noise and passes the data to the trusted HD Noise Cancelling Processor QN1. Then a new Bluetooth Audio SoC (System on Chip) senses and adjusts to music and noise at over 700 times per second. Using a new algorithm, the HD Noise Cancelling Processor QN1 applies noise cancelling processing in real-time.",SNE,en,Sify.com

The four 2020 consoles will feature similar hardware, which means you’re bound to experience the future of gaming no matter which you choose this fall. The Xbox Series X offers better theoretical performance, but the PS5 models make use of similar components to achieve comparable speed. The Series S features the same chip as the Series X, but a slower GPU, which appears to be a necessary compromise to keep the price down.

On his latest album, companion to a PBS broadcast in the US , he performs with friends – Jeremy Denk , Peter Dugan and Kamal Khan – and his wife, the soprano Larisa Martínez . Joshua Bell: At Home With Music (Sony) contains eight short tracks, from Dvořák (arr Kreisler) to Gershwin (arr Heifetz), via Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Chopin, Wieniawski and Bernstein. The choice is personal and idiosyncratic, the mood salon-style music of the highest quality, impeccably performed by Bell on his 1713 “Huberman” Stradivarius . He and pianist Jeremy Denk play only the opening movement of Beethoven’s “Spring” sonata, but it’s enough to hint at the work’s serenity, drama and scale. You might wish for the whole sonata, but that thought is banished by the quick shift into Dvořák’s wistful Slavonic Fantasy in B minor (with Peter Dugan).",SNE,en,The Guardian

Apple kicked Fortnite off the App Store three weeks ago after Epic allowed users to pay the company directly for in-app transactions.

Three divorces and one name change later, they’re back When the Dixie Chicks signed to Sony in 1995, the label worried that their name was politically incorrect. At the time, the bosses were more concerned about “Chicks” than “Dixie”, a shorthand for the former Confederate states, although they warned the Texan trio that listeners in the northern states might be put off. But Natalie Maines and sisters Emily Strayer and Martie Maguire stood their ground and went on to become one of the biggest country acts of all time. The Dixie Chicks brought traditional instrumentation back to a genre that had been growing overly slick. They used their country bona fides not in the service of misogynistic murder ballads but, rather, cheeky proto-feminist classics. Almost everything they did riled purists and pearl-clutchers, but that did not stop their first album for Sony, 1998’s Wide Open Spaces, selling more copies that year than every other country act combined.",SNE,en,The Guardian

One of the hottest topics online in 2020 has been speculation about the prices of the new game consoles from Sony and Microsoft. Months ago, a Bloomberg report suggested that Sony was struggling with the price of the PlayStation 5 due to the costly parts needed to produce the hardware, and it seemed likely some of that cost would be passed on to the consumer. Five months later, we still don't know how much the PS5 is going to cost, but in recent weeks, rumors have been flaring up with regularity, to the point that Sony felt the need to comment. On Friday, The Game Awards host and creator Geoff Keighley shared the first official hands-on video with the PS5's DualSense controller, and had a chance to speak with PlayStation's Head of Marketing Eric Lempel.",SNE,en,BGR

In its May 2020 corporate strategy meeting, Sony noted that ""image sensors will be key devices in the AI era.""

One of the first, and most exciting, trailers to debut at Sony's PS5 Future of Gaming event on Thursday was for what appeared to be a brand new game set in the same universe as 2018's Marvel's Spider-Man . Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales was set to be the first PS5 title from Insomniac Games, and one of the first next-gen exclusives period, with a release window of holiday 2020. But details were sparse. Was this a full-fledged sequel to the 2018 game? Was it a spinoff? We had no idea, but in an interview with The Telegraph published after the event, Sony executive Simon Rutter referred to Miles Morales as ""an expansion and an enhancement to the previous game."" The Telegraph then called Miles Morales ""an expansion bolted on to an upgraded version of the original title.""

Two years ago at E3, the yearly video games conference, Microsoft’s Phil Spencer told the Guardian that “we pivoted about three or four years ago to thinking about the gamer first, not the device first … Our focus is on bringing console quality games that you see on TV or PC to any device.” But Sony is doubling down on the idea of the games console, of generational technology shifts that make new kinds of games possible, and on the idea of selling us a new box by funding games that you can only play on PlayStation 5.",SNE,en,The Guardian

It is difficult to explain how exactly it does this without robbing players of the chance to experience it for themselves, but I will say this: no video game has ever gone to these lengths to humanise the enemy, or to interrogate the violence that it asks the player to perform. We play as Ellie, a 19-year-old born a few years after a fungal illness devastated human civilisation, turning the afflicted into shambling, deformed husks and the world’s cities into overgrown relics.

People still argue over how successful that first assumption was, but with this recording he puts his own stamp on it. Kaufmann’s Otello starts out as less the swaggering hero, more the serious commanding officer, and as he becomes more and more defined by his own instability he alternates between a taut, intense tone of anger and certainty and a less tightly focused, more burnished voice full of doubt – at times it’s almost a Jekyll-and-Hyde-type characterisation, but a subtler one than that might suggest.

Why did Sony repurpose its Game Developers Conference talk rather than prepare something new for an audience made up of hundreds of thousands of consumers? Why have we not seen any games running on the PS5 yet, or even a technical demo of the console in action? The simple answer to virtually all of these questions is as follows: Sony isn't ready yet. That's not to say that the final design of the console is still in flux, or that the PS5 is incapable of playing games in its current state, but Sony's not ready to pull back the curtain yet.",SNE,en,BGR.com

Then, a few days ago, Microsoft confirmed almost all the official specs of the new Xbox Series X console in a blog post. The coronavirus may have ruined Sony’s PS5 launch plans, but we’ll never really know. Sony never got to announcing a PlayStation Meeting event, and we might not get one considering the current state of the epidemic.

The Xbox Series X name and design were revealed in mid-December, and the company just shared many of the console’s next-gen specs this week. Both were complete surprises, as Microsoft hijacked an awards show to reveal the console’s design last December, and then suddenly dropped a blog post that featured a deep dive into the Xbox Series X’s hardware this week. While we wait for Sony’s moves, which will likely be affected by the coronavirus outbreak that prompted the cancelation of several major events, with Sony itself pulling out of at least three trade shows so far, we do have more exciting PlayStation news for you. Unlike Microsoft, which has controlled the narrative, Sony’s innovations have leaked at a steady pace.

Sony might not be ready to make any PS5 announcements and the company won’t be present at PAX East or GDC this year, but we do have a huge new leak for PlayStation 5 fans following yesterday's news that GameStop confirmed some important PlayStation 5 specs : The first PS5 accessory might've just been uncovered, and it appears to confirm even more key PS5 specs.

I would've laughed if you had told me a few months ago that I would be saying this now, but for the time being, Microsoft has an obvious edge. Sony absolutely crushed Microsoft in the current-generation console battle, with PS4 sales that have exceeded 110 million units and about doubled estimated Xbox One sales. A few months ago when PS5 and Xbox Series X leaks started picking up steam, it seemed like we were headed for more of the same following their releases ahead of the holidays in 2020. There was so much hype surrounding the PlayStation 5 and it seemed like almost no one was talking about the Xbox Series X, which was only known at the time as Project Scarlett. Now, things have definitely changed. Sony was rumored to be planning a PS5 event sometime in February, but that obviously didn't happen.

With just hours left to go in February, it seems unlikely that this will be the month we learn more about the next-gen console, which is why even a page on GameStop's website to sign up for notifications about the PS5 has made some waves online. To be clear, you can't even preorder the console -- GameStop will just email you when you can. Snark aside, GameStop does run down a few of the key features and specifications we learned about last year, so we thought it might be interesting to compare everything we know about the PlayStation 5 with the detailed blog post that Microsoft shared earlier this week about the ridiculously powerful Xbox Series X. Here are the PS5 bullet points on GameStop's website, summarizing virtually everything we know so far: Full 8K TV support Bespoke 8-core AMD chipset 3D Audio Built-for-purpose SSD storage Backwards compatibility with PS4 games/PSVR hardware Ray tracing capabilities In order to make it easier to compare the two, I condensed the Xbox Series X blog into bullet points as well: AMD CPU with Zen 2 and RDNA 2 architectures 12 teraflops of GPU performance Variable Rate Shading Hardware-accelerated DirectX Raytracing Next-generation SSD Quick Resume Dynamic Latency Input HDMI 2.1 Auto Low Latency Mode and Variable Refresh Rate 120FPS support Backwards compatibility with Xbox One, Xbox 360, and Xbox games Smart Delivery for buying games on multiple console generations Let's start with the similarities.",SNE,en,BGR.com

While essential for many devices, buying an SD card isn't always straightforward. There are different names, like SDHC and SDXC, and numbers for speed class and storage all mixed together in a jumble of technical jargon. The best SD card for one device may be overkill for the next, or even incompatible. For most devices using standard-size SD cards, the SanDisk Extreme Pro SDHC UHS-I is our pick. Not only is it affordable, but it has a decent balance of speed and durability — enough to handle demanding tasks, like recording 4K video and capturing RAW photos. For the best microSD card, we opt for the equally-affordable Samsung EVO Plus . But, if you want to learn more on how to choose an SD card or microSD card in this guide, read on.

Xperia 2 is out of the question, so a variation of Xperia 1 is inevitable. Sony also unveiled the Xperia 10 II mid-range handset at the same event, a device bearing the same naming structure.

Waiting on Microsoft to set a price on its own console isn’t helping, either. According to a report from Bloomberg, the PS5’s current unit cost is up to around $450, which would push the retail price of the console almost $100 more than its predecessor. The company is struggling to obtain enough DRAM and flash memory, already in high demand from smartphone manufacturers.

That partnership fell apart, but not before protoypes of the joint console were created. Though the prototypes were scrapped and the partnership dissolved, at least one prototype console managed to survive — and it's now available in an auction if you've got a few hundred thousand dollars to spare. It's the only known version of the game console in existence. At least one millionaire with a vested interest in video games is leading the auction: Palmer Luckey, who co-founded Oculus VR, created the Oculus Rift, and subsequently sold his company to Facebook for $2 billion.

It admittedly sounds crazy, but there's actually an interesting backstory to a console that, at first glance, sounds completely made up. As the story goes, Sony and Nintendo back in 1988 inked a deal whereby Sony would provide Nintendo with CD-ROM drives for the SNES. The thinking, at the time, was that the SNES would be able to play traditional Nintendo cartridge games along with disc-based games via Sony's CD-ROM technology. Ultimately, the hybrid device never saw the light of day as the two companies ultimately couldn't work past a variety of licensing issues. In short, money ended up killing a console that could have easily altered the trajectory of gaming for years to come. Before the deal was axed, an estimated 200 prototypes were manufactured.

Sony has been making Spider-Man films for nearly two decades, but none of them had the same success as the Spider-Man trilogy that Marvel included in its big, daring cinematic universe.

Nonetheless, the number of patients is increasing at a steady rate — and with it, the number of fatalities. The spread of the virus might not only affect production but actual product announcements in the coming months, PS5 included . Sony just announced that it’s pulling out of Mobile World Congress, the most important mobile trade show of the year, following the lead of other companies that withdrew from MWC in the past few days. Is the hotly anticipated PS5 launch the next big event that will be impacted?

Elliott's involvement is likely to cast new light on SoftBank's financial track record, which has been scrutinized heavily by investors after several of its expensive bets on startups around the world, including office space-sharing firm WeWork, soured. The New York-headquartered hedge fund has owned SoftBank shares for years but late last year grew its stake into one of its largest-ever positions in a company, the sources said. Elliott now owns roughly 3% of SoftBank, the sources added. SoftBank has been vulnerable to investor criticism that its stock trades at a deep discount to the value of its holdings. Its shares jumped 8% on Friday morning in Tokyo, giving the conglomerate a market capitalization of roughly $95 billion.

Sony first started revealing PS5 features last year, without actually delivering any specifics. We know the console will feature a powerful CPU/GPU combo, as well as much faster storage than before. On top of that, some of the DualShock 5’s new features have also been revealed. But Sony stayed away from offering actual specifics about the PS5.

That said, Sony just went on record to say that it hasn’t yet decided on the PlayStation 5’s price. And while we have no idea how much it’ll end up costing, there’s a good reason to believe that Sony's indecision is actually good news. Several rumors said in the past few weeks that the PS5 will cost $499, which sounds like a reasonable price for a next-generation gaming rig at launch.",SNE,en,BGR.com

2020-02-04 10:58:24-05:00,A supposed insider might’ve just leaked Sony’s PS5 launch timing,"PlayStation fans have been anxiously waiting for Sony to finally send out press invites ahead of the rumored February PlayStation Meeting 2020 event, but that didn't happen. Seven years ago, Sony invited the media on January 31st to attend the PS4 press conference that took place three weeks later. That gives Sony only a few days to announce an event that would take place in late February, at best. But a new report claims that the PlayStation 5 press conference will take place in March, with invitations to be sent out later this month. An insider who has shared plenty of information about the PS5 before took to Twitter to say that the keynote will happen in March, as previously stated on the same account: https://twitter.com/PSErebus/status/1223380445246754816 https://twitter.com/PSErebus/status/1223379187765063681 https://twitter.com/PSErebus/status/1223376677994205184 We did cover @PSErebus 's claims before , when the anonymous leaker said that PS5 preorders will begin in March with the console set to be released in mid-November. https://twitter.com/PSErebus/status/1211044165682896897 However, he didn't reveal an actual date for the PS5 press event before, and the loose March preorder date seemed to suggest a February press event.",SNE,en,BGR.com

The Z Flip is going to be Samsung’s second take at foldable handsets, a phone that has the same design as the Motorola Razr that’s now available for preorder. The clamshell design will make the handset a lot easier to carry around than the Galaxy Fold, which still looks huge when folded. Moreover, the Z Flip is supposed to be the first Samsung foldable to feature an ultra-thin glass display, as well as a more affordable price tag. Add to that a 2019 flagship processor, and the Z Flip is a much better offer than the mid-rang Razr clamshell. These are just rumors for the time being, but the video below can at least confirm the Z Flip’s design. Posted on Twitter by leaker/designer Ben Geskin, the video below shows someone operating the phone with one hand. The person can easily fold and unfold the handset and flip it around. https://twitter.com/BenGeskin/status/1223926886658605056 The device is quite tall, certainly taller than initially believed, and it’s reminiscent of Sony’s 2019 Xperia flagships, although those handsets do not fold.",SNE,en,BGR.com

More recently, a leaker who shared plenty of information about Sony's PS5 launch plans offered an actual date and venue: Sony Hall, New York, on February 5th. But as we get closer to that date, it seems increasingly unlikely Sony will hold an event so soon. The company has yet to issue press invites, which usually drop a few weeks in advance of a keynote. Sony announced the PlayStation Meeting 2013 presser on January 31st that year, nearly three weeks ahead of the February 20th debut. But Sony might still hold its PS5 event next month, and fans think they've finally discovered actual the date. Redditor PennyOhms looked at the Sony Hall calendar for February and found a Private Event scheduled for February 29th, which would kick off at 7:00 PM ET. According to the Redditor, there's nothing on the schedule for February 5th. As with other PS5 rumors, however, there's nothing definitive to confirm the date.",SNE,en,BGR.com

Of these five games, Gearbox Software's Godfall is the only one that has been made official by the studio working on it.

Initially TVs were a luxury item for the wealthy, but thanks to price drops, sales were booming by the end of the 1940s, and by 1989, 60% of Americans had cable. Throughout the last century, TV designs have changed from bulky to sleek, large to small — but not every new set has been a hit. Visit Insider's homepage for more stories. From ""Who Shot JR?"" to The Red Wedding, ""I Love Lucy"" to ""Friends,"" TV has offered defining moments of pop culture and modern society. Together, viewers have witnessed tragedies like 9/11 and collective joys like the Moon Landing. Television sets themselves have changed a lot in the past hundred years. What began as a large box with three channels and grainy images has evolved to high-definition flat screens with multitudes of content. Streaming sites like Netflix and Amazon Prime continue to change the way people absorb media, often placing the power in the palm of a hand.",SNE,en,Business Insider

Horizon Zero Dawn , which launched in 2017, was developed by Guerrilla Games -- the studio which once dedicated most of its resources to the Killzone series. Not only was Horizon well-received by critics, but it went on to sell over 10 million copies, making it one of the biggest success stories of the generation. A sequel is all but guaranteed, but even with a new console in the works, Sony is already extending its tendrils beyond home consoles. Kotaku's report suggests that Horizon Zero Dawn will hit both Steam and the Epic Games Store when it makes its way to PC.

Although the home console isn't going anywhere (at least not any time soon), Microsoft has already begun to redefine the gaming industry with the launch of services like Xbox Game Pass and Project xCloud. In the months to come, gaming on Xbox won't actually necessitate owning an Xbox. Driving this point home was Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty, who recently sat down with MCV/Develop in order to discuss the next generation. One of the first topics of discussion was how this console launch will differ from other generations, as Xbox's first-party games will be playable on multiple pieces of hardware. “As our content comes out over the next year, two years, all of our games, sort of like PC, will play up and down that family of devices,” Booty says. “We want to make sure that if someone invests in Xbox between now and [Series X] that they feel that they made a good investment and that we’re committed to them with content.” Watching Microsoft balance its new software strategy with a relatively standard next-gen console release could very well end up being the most intriguing storyline of the decade for the industry.",SNE,en,BGR.com

2020-01-06 19:06:07-05:00,Sony CES 2020 press conference: Watch the live stream right here at 8 PM ET,"CES keynotes typically aren't as exciting as the individual press conferences these enormous tech companies later in the year. For example, we know that Samsung will host its next Unpacked event in February, which is where its major mobile announcements will be made. But Sony's press conference has the potential to be huge -- not because of a new TV or a fridge that can do your laundry, but because the PlayStation 5 might be unveiled. In all likelihood, Sony will reserve the full PS5 reveal for an event like the one it held in 2013 for the PS4, but following the surprise showing of the Xbox Series X at The Game Awards, it will be interesting to see if Microsoft forced Sony's hand. At the very least, there's a small chance we'll know what the PS5 looks like after tonight. Sony's CES press conference kicks off at 5 PM PT / 8 PM ET, and providing it's about the same length as last year's event, it should last around 40 minutes or so. Beyond the potential of the PS5, Sony will almost certainly have a wide variety of consumer electronics on display, including 4K TVs, soundbars, headphones, and speakers.",SNE,en,BGR.com

We already know what sort of performance upgrades to expect from the hardware, and Sony previously revealed the significant haptic improvements coming to the PS5 controller, which will probably be called DualShock 5. But a new discovery indicates that the device might have a few additional features that aren’t available on DualShock 4, and Sony might not be ready to reveal them just yet. Dutch-language blog LetsGoDigital found a Sony patent application dated June 20th, 2019 that was published online on December 26th. The documentation details the functionality of a PlayStation controller that features extra buttons on the back.

The winner? The console from Sony, with its PS4 still as popular as ever and having racked up some 154,522 more units than the Xbox One in the last month, according to VGChartz. That's only added to a substantial lifetime sales lead the PS4 enjoys over the Xbox One, with the website's estimates showing that almost 4.6 million additional PS4 consoles have been sold, compared to its rival, since the launch of both consoles in November 2013. All of those numbers mentioned above, just to reiterate, are US totals. The latest estimates show that in the previous 12 months, the PS4 has also sold 701,767 more units than the Xbox One, and the lifetime US sales estimates for both consoles are as follows: PS4 total sales in the US : 31,411,653 Xbox One total sales in the US : 26,845,047 In terms of global sales, meanwhile, it should be noted that the PS4 surpassed 100 million units sold back during the quarter that ended in September.",SNE,en,BGR.com

Both next-generation consoles will have the same powerful AMD CPU and GPU chips, as well as high-speed SSDs that will make game loading times a thing of the past.

As Coyle pointed out, Bluetooth audio latency in wireless earphones can cheapen the user experience of these devices, and can particularly cause major issues for certain accessibility features reliant upon audio accuracy. Coyle measured latency by testing how much time passes between a user triggering a sound and when they hear it in the earphones. The developer pointed out that these user-initiated sounds ""are the most commonly encountered example"" of Bluetooth audio latency, because they are unpredictable and therefore difficult for most platforms to respond to with finesse. These include keyboard clicks, accessibility features like VoiceOver, and sound effects in games. Image via Stephen Coyle Using the default iOS keyboard and his own game Tapt as means of measuring this latency, Coyle discovered that the ‌AirPods Pro‌ have the lowest average audio latency (measured in milliseconds) among the entire ‌AirPods‌ line. ‌AirPods‌ 1 measured in at 274ms between the time the sound was triggered and the time the sound was heard, then ‌AirPods‌ 2 was at 178ms, and ‌AirPods Pro‌ clocked in at 144ms.",SNE,en,Mac Rumors

Sensor-shift technology could change this, as the stabilization would apply to the camera sensor itself and not be dependant on any specific lens. Sensor-shifting image stabilization could also result in better shots with attachable lens accessories like the OlloClip. The report backs rumors that the high-end 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch iPhones will each sport a triple-lens rear camera system with time-of-flight 3D sensing.

All we had was a teaser trailer, but PlayStation LifeStyle got the chance to interview Keith Lee, Counterplay Games CEO and creative director on Godfall , to find out more about the game and why it needed to be on the PS5 instead of a current-gen console.

So why is Godfall exclusive to the next-gen console, and not cross-gen?

Debretzeni’s joyful, spirited playing, precise but free, gives endless pleasure. • The Greek violinist Leonidas Kavakos , one of the most exciting soloists on the concert platform, conducts as well as plays Beethoven’s Violin Concerto (Sony, 2CDs) with the large forces of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra – no easy task for a work on this scale but the results are flexible and beautifully integrated.",SNE,en,The Guardian

Multiple suppliers are competing for the business of manufacturing the Pro earphones, though some are still building up the technical proficiency. After a ramp-up in popularity of the original ‌AirPods‌, which debuted in late 2016, Apple has released two updates to the lineup this year, with second-generation ‌AirPods‌ in March and the new ‌AirPods Pro‌ just a few weeks ago. Apple Watch and ‌AirPods‌ are the two cornerstones of Apple's push into wearables so far, and both have seen strong growth over the past few years. ‌AirPods‌ are the market leader in true wireless earphones, which are proving popular with consumers.",SNE,en,Mac Rumors

Divisive creator Hideo Kojima’s open-world epic resolves its mysteries, but your satisfaction is numbed by painful memories of relentless trekking, jarring menu management and some – frankly wild – tonal shifts. Over time, your relationship with Death Stranding may start to shift, but it’s a slow-burn album track, not a pop hit. Your feelings about Hideo Kojima’s longest, most indulgent, project will hinge on how you buy into the game’s theme about the importance of belief when all seems futile.
