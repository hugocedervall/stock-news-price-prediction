2019-05-20 22:50:33-05:00,"ATMs, once the future of banking, starting to become more scarce","By Hannah LevittIn the wake of the economic crisis, Paul Volcker called automated teller machines the last financial innovation that improved society. A decade later, their popularity is slipping.The number of ATMs around the world fell for the first time last year as banks closed branches and redirected resources toward digital payments, consulting firm RBR said in a study released on Monday. Declines in four of the world’s five largest markets - China, the U.S., Japan and Brazil - drove the 1% drop in ATMs in 2018. In the fifth, India, “growth slowed considerably,” London-based RBR said.Bank customers are increasingly turning to their mobile phones for routine financial services, and moving away from cash in favor of credit and debit cards. JPMorgan Chase & Co., the biggest U.S. bank, cut back its branches by 2% last year while earmarking $10.8 billion for technology. The lender saw a 5% increase in active digital customers, and an 11% gain in active mobile customers.While the ATM count worldwide has fallen for the first time, the shift away from the machines isn’t a new phenomenon.",DBD,en,The Economic Times India
