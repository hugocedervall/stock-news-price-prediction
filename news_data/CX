Ayer, los alumnos del colegio Juan de Yepes y los vecinos, especialmente los jubilados y las personas mayores, han podido conocer mejor las normas de seguridad vial para evitar accidentes. La gente mayor, los niños y los adolescentes son los principales grupos de riesgo a los que va dirigida la campaña, que ya se ha presentado en Cataluña, Levante y que en los próximos meses se irá dando a conocer a lo largo de toda la geografía nacional. Un camión cisterna de gran tonelaje, un camión bañera y una hormigonera, todos ellos vehículos utilizados por Cemex en su trabajo diario y pintados de un llamativo color naranja, han estacionado a las puertas del colegio Juan de Yepes y en el centro de la localidad. El objetivo es mostrar a los niños y mayores cómo deben comportarse de forma segura cuando coinciden en la vía con diferentes tipos de vehículos y así evitar accidentes. Cemex ha rotulado parte de su flota de camiones con el lema de la campaña: «No te la juegues.",CX,es,ABC
