2020-12-04 08:20:00-05:00,Credit Suisse names 4 firms as likely deal targets after a fresh wave of asset management M&A — and pinpoints possible buyers,"Summary List Placement On the heels of yet another major investment management combination , a new report sheds light on where analysts think the next deal for wealth and asset managers could strike. ""Asset manager M&A wave will continue with a variety of potential transactions,"" analysts at Credit Suisse led by Craig Siegenthaler wrote to clients on Thursday. The evening before, Australia-based Macquarie Group said it would acquire investment manager Waddell & Reed. Macquarie is set to buy the Overland Park, Kansas-based firm for $1.7 billion, or $2.3 billion Australian dollars, and is set to sell Waddell's wealth management business to major independent US broker-dealer LPL Financial for some $300 million once that deal closes. The plans to acquire Waddell, the parent company of Ivy Investments, which Business Insider previously reported could be sold off , sent analysts wondering which firm could be next. Credit Suisse pegged BrightSphere Investment Group, WisdomTree Investments, Janus Henderson, and Cohen & Steers as the ""likeliest sellers,"" and named Invesco and Franklin Resources as possible acquirers of other firms.",CNS,en,Business Insider

2020-06-09 03:53:29-05:00,"Industrial metals still look cheap as manufacturing restarts, say asset managers","Industrial metals still look cheap as manufacturing restarts, say asset managers Submitted By Madeleine Taylor | 09/06/2020 - 9:53am As the global economy judders into an unsteady restart, stock markets rebound, and manufacturing grows, one thing that has been slow to take off is commodities prices. A typically unloved asset class, most investors are still avoiding commodities since the collapse in manufacturing demand in February, and country lockdowns sent oil futures to negative levels in April. This caution has kept prices low for the most part, with asset managers increasingly believing that there is now considerable upside. Jeroen Blokland, a senior portfolio manager for Robeco’s multi-asset fund, says the time has come to invest again. “Out of all the risky asset classes, commodities have priced in the least amount of the global economic recovery that we see happening in the upcoming quarters. The combination of demand and supply rebalancing and a clear improvement in GDP growth numbers following this historical economic decline should push prices of industrial metals higher,” says Blokland in a monthly outlook report.",CNS,en,InstitutionAlassetManager
