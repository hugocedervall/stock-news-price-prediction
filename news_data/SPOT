To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here. Spotify is moving to test a 13% price hike for its premium family plan in Scandinavia, where the service originated, per Bloomberg. The company is likely looking to gauge pricing sensitivity in a market it dominates before attempting to hike the price elsewhere. Spotify's premium family plan now costs $15 a month — with the increase, that plan would cost about $17 a month. Spotify has leaned on discounted offerings to drive subscriptions to its paid tier, but that's likely dampened monetization — a problem that higher prices could potentially alleviate. For example, it's offered a student bundle in the US at $5 a month, which includes Spotify Premium, the ad-supported tier of Hulu, and Showtime's OTT offering. And in emerging markets, where consumers likely have less willingness and ability to pay, Spotify has launched cheaper options.",SPOT,en,Business Insider

2019-05-06 06:23:07-05:00,Apple could face an E.U. investigation over complaint from Spotify: FT,"Investigators in the European Union are reportedly preparing to launch a formal investigation into Apple Inc. and potential anticompetitive practices, according to a report from the Financial Times. The investigation would follow a complaint from rival Spotify Technology SA , which has argued that the 30% cut Apple takes from developers after consumers complete an in-app purchase makes it challenging for companies to compete against Apple. In particular, Spotify has argued that it may have to raise prices for its premium streaming plan to compensate for having to pay Apple a sizable chunk of its subscription fees. Apple and Spotify both declined to comment in the FT's report. Apple shares have gained 34% so far this year, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen 14%.
