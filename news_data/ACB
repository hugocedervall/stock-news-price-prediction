Two of the biggest Canadian cannabis companies, Canopy Growth and Aphria are using deals and partnerships to gain a foothold in the US. These moves come as five states, including New Jersey and Arizona, voted to legalize marijuana during the November election . Cannabis firms are betting that President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will be friendlier to the industry than President Donald Trump, as the Biden campaign has pledged to decriminalize marijuana.

Adding to the optimism, the Democratic-led House of Representatives passed the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act, which would federally decriminalize cannabis and expunge the records of those convicted for cannabis-related crimes.",ACB,en,Business Insider

While Biden has stopped short of endorsing federal legalization, both he and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, have campaigned on decriminalizing marijuana . Marijuana decriminalization is a key pillar of Biden's criminal justice reform plan . The campaign said Biden's administration would move cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substance Act (CSA) to Schedule II, which would allow more researchers to study the drug's impacts as both a medicine and a consumer product. On top of that, the Biden administration has said it will back legislation to expunge the records of those convicted for marijuana-related crimes. Biden also supports cannabis legalization for medical uses and wants to allow states to legalize recreational cannabis and create commercial markets without federal interference. Biden's transition website had no mention of cannabis policy as of Tuesday, however.",ACB,en,Business Insider

Arizona and New Jersey are most likely to legalize the drug, according to Cowen analyst Vivien Azer. Those states have the biggest potential markets, which could be a boon for some of the largest US cannabis companies. The potential legalization of adult-use cannabis in New Jersey and Arizona ""should have overarching positive implications"" for the legal cannabis market, according to Azer. She wrote in a Sept. 10 note that the two states ""represent by far the biggest revenue opportunity"" among states with ballot referendums in November. Curaleaf, Green Thumb Industries, Acreage Holdings, and Cresco Labs, all of which have operations in New Jersey and/or Arizona, are well positioned to benefit if adult-use passes in the two states.

With the COVID-19 pandemic still front and center, the long-term impact of this virus on the broader economy and the cannabis industry remains highly uncertain. That said, cannabis is now “essential” in virtually all respects. Across the country, this portends a long-term boon for the industry and those who invest in it.

The key is to understand the investment landscape and the appropriate timing for deployment of capital in each case. Let’s explore a few.

Sign up here to get it in your inbox every week . If you want a discount to BI Prime to read our stories, sign up here! Happy Friday readers, In perhaps the most shocking news this week – at least in my little corner of the cannabis world — a Justice Department whistleblower alleged that Attorney General William Barr misused department resources to deliberately hold up ten marijuana mega-mergers because he doesn't like pot. It's not Barr's fault the market tanked, nor is it his fault that mismanagement on the operators' part led to some of these deals failing to close. But wielding the might of DOJ, and not to mention the time, resources, and dozens of employees that these types of investigations take because of a personal vendetta is a dangerous precedent indeed. I wouldn't say this is surprising, though. Cannabis companies exist at the margins of what will be tolerated by the US federal government.",ACB,en,Business Insider

While we continue to see massive layoffs, management shakeups and event cancellations across the board, businesses are struggling to adapt to their new situations, offering delivery services, free access to virtual platforms and more.

Cannabis companies are more accustomed than most to pivot and pivot hard when things change overnight,” Green Market Report CEO Debra Borchardt told Benzinga. “Delivery services have increased, curbside options have begun and many dispensaries have vowed to remain open at some level. Sales are robust at most as the stress of this situation has caused many consumers to need cannabis to reduce anxiety or at least make the quarantine period a little more tolerable.” If you want to get this news recap in your email inbox every week, please subscribe to https://tinyletter.com/javierhasse Khiron Life Sciences Corp (OTC: KHRNF ) announced good news from Colombia: it has received an authorization to start manufacturing cannabis-containing medicines, becoming the first company operating in the country to do so.",ACB,en,Benzinga Feeds

ACB also did not offer much insight on Dec qtr (perhaps reasonable given uncertainty on stores), only suggesting trends could stay similar pending more stores/rec 2.0 in CQ120.” Aurora has CA$458 million liquidity versus cash use of CA$522 million, which means it will have to use its remaining equity ATM to make up for the difference, the analyst said.",ACB,en,Benzinga Feeds

In this article we'll look at why investors and/or shareholders need to temper their expectations for Aurora in the near term, and why the long-term outlook remains strong. Near-Term Outlook In the short term I don't see any significant positive catalysts that will drive the share price of the company up. The two major factors that are out of the company's control, which will be major growth engines for the company in the months and years ahead, are outside of its control; I'm talking about the slow retail licensing process in Canada and the legalization of derivatives in the country. Even though derivatives have now been legalized in Canada, they won't be able to be sold until the end of December, meaning it won't have any significant impact on the performance of Aurora until after the first full calendar quarter of 2020.",ACB,en,Nasdaq

The second phase of legalization will bring three new classes of cannabis to dispensary shelves: edibles, concentrates and topicals. Cannabis 2.0 Sales Expectations: Edibles Should Dominate It would be an understatement to say that sales expectations for Cannabis 2.0 are huge. The Brightfield Group estimates Canada’s cannabis industry will reach $3.7 billion by the end of 2020, which is more than double the $1.6 billion it reached in 2019, according to CNN Business. Sales of the newly legalized cannabis products, such as edibles, vapes and topicals, are projected to hit $900 million in sales, Brightfield Group managing director Bethany Gomez told CNN. Another forecast from Deloitte projected in June that the Canadian edibles market will be worth a minimum of $1.6 billion annually, with cannabis-infused beverages adding $529 million more. What’s more, Deloitte’s survey results said 59% of likely cannabis users intend to use cannabis-infused edibles, which indicates they could be the most profitable category among the newly legalized products.",ACB,en,Benzinga

Roosevelt signed the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 which prohibited cannabis entirely. Prior to then, cannabis was primarily used as an herbal medicine to treat ailments. However, due to the biological nature of the THC or tetrahydrocannabinol compound, cannabis was deemed as a drug by prior administrations. By the early 1990s, a handful of states began to legalize cannabis for strictly medicinal purposes as California became the first state to do so back in 1996 with the approval of Proposition 215. After California's ruling, numerous states began to follow suit and also legalized medical cannabis. Then in 2012, the cannabis industry was completely reshaped after Colorado and Washington both legalized recreational cannabis. Now, there are 33 states that have legalized medical cannabis while 10 states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational use as well.

Cannabis is a family of plants with two primary classifications: indica and sativa. Marijuana and hemp are also two derivatives of the cannabis family. Marijuana can fall into either the indica or sativa classifications, while hemp is only within the sativa one. An important factor is that the two classifications differ heavily in their biological makeup. Overall, marijuana is linked to causing psychoactive effects, which is why it was strictly regulated so heavily until more recent years. Now, researchers have realized that marijuana can be used for medical applications to treat conditions such as cancer and chronic pain. Then there's hemp, which is the non-psychoactive derivative of cannabis, and still offers therapeutic and relaxing effects. Additionally, while the use of marijuana and hemp is more common now for medical applications, there is still a large recreational market, particularly in the U.S. and Canada .",ACB,en,Benzinga
