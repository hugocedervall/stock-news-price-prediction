2020-05-16 12:30:00-05:00,The most powerful bureaucrats during these times,"Reasi and Ramban are adjacent districts in Jammu and Kashmir that have been classified as orange zones — the moderate classification in a three-colour tag given to districts depending on the cases of Covid-19. But the response of the districts have been strikingly dissimilar to the Centre’s order allowing the resumption of work on infrastructure projects from April 20, aimed at slowly getting out of the lockdown.The deputy commissioner of Reasi, the more populated of the two, allowed infrastructure work to resume almost immediately. However, Indu Kanwal Chib ensured that social distancing rules were enforced and ambulances were kept ready near the worksite.But her peer at Ramban took a more unhurried approach. The deputy commissioner asked officials to inspect the project sites concerned and had several questions for the ground staff. Finally, on May 5 — a fortnight after the work could have resumed — the deputy commissioner allowed companies such as Gammon India, Afcons Infrastructure and Hindustan Construction Company to resume work on bridges and tunnels in the district. “Our permission is conditional, and for us, the health of the workers is critical,” says the deputy commissioner of Ramban, Nazim Zai Khan.Khan and 732 other heads of civil administration in districts are now arguably among the most powerful bureaucrats in the country.",HCC,en,Economic Times India

Industry also reckons these rules may disincetivise resumption. These rules allow district authorities to take action, under the Disaster Management Act, against companies for not just non-compliance with safety measures but also for any incidence of Covid-19 at workplaces.“It’s not very practical. One can definitely expect infections to occur when we restart operations. We need protocols on how to handle it…not punishment for managers/owners. No factory can open under these circumstances,” said Venu Srinivasan, chairman of TVS Motor. “Further, some states want labour to be kept inside the premises.

After all, the comings and goings of the markets and daily price fluctuations are interesting to observe, but they would have significantly less appeal if the possibility of profit was taken out of the equation. Like in any field, though, there are multiple routes to achieving the desired end-goal. You could go it alone and develop the skills of spotting a compelling investment opportunity, or maybe follow the lead of a fellow investor. Or you could go the tried and tested way of listening to the experts’ advice. Here’s where we turn to the Street, where according to some, the massive disruption caused by the coronavirus has created particular openings for investors. We will take a look at two stocks which were recently reassessed by those in the know.
