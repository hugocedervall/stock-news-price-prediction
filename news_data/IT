Long before cloud computing was a thing, for instance, Ellison proselytized the premature notion of a network computer. Later he picked up a disgraced ex-computer hardware CEO, the late Mark Hurd , and made him an Oracle selling machine. Then there was the time a few years ago when Ellison seriously considered swapping a giant chunk of Oracle stock for SoftBank's stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. This never-before-reported gambit didn't see the light of the day because Oracle's board of directors squashed it. Given how much Alibaba's stock has outperformed Oracle's, it would have been a hell of a trade. But that's another story. All this talk of Ellison's bold if bizarre moves is highly relevant now because of Oracle's increasingly quixotic quest to grab a piece of TikTok, the Chinese-owned dance-video phenomenon beloved by youngsters of all ages.",IT,en,Business Insider

Prioritize wildfire restoration and fighting deforestation Heather Clancy Thu, 10/22/2020 - 02:00 Back in my former life as a tech journo, my coverage was informed by the infamous "" hype cycle "" phrase coined by research firm Gartner to describe the arc of emerging technology adoption from the spark of innovation to mainstream adoption. Lately, I’ve been mulling that framework a great deal in the context of a much-ballyhooed nature-based solution for removing carbon emissions: planting trees. Heck, even the climate-denier-in-chief loves the idea . Right now, we are clearly in the ""peak of inflated expectations"" phase of the tree-planting movement, with new declarations hitting my inbox every week. Pretty much any company with a net-zero commitment has placed tree projects at the center of its short-term strategy, often as part of declarations related to the Trillion Trees initiative. As a verified tree-hugger, I’m encouraged. But, please, it’s time to refine the dialogue: While tree-planting events in parks or schoolyards make for great photo opps, we should devote far more time to acts of restoration and conservation.",IT,en,GreenBiz
