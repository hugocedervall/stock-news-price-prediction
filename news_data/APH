Analysts at CIBC and Cowen picked 7 stocks to bet on that would benefit if the Democrats win, including Green Thumb Industries, Curaleaf, and Canopy Growth. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . As public support for cannabis reform picks up steam in the US, Wall Street analysts say signs are pointing to a turnaround in the formerly troubled sector, especially as a few companies posted solid earnings over the past week.

That, on top of the coronavirus-pandemic-induced sales bump , has upped investor confidence in the sector after months of stock declines and layoffs.

2020-03-13 15:47:14-05:00,The Cannabis ‘Basket Approach’ for Long-Term Gains: 3 Stocks to Consider,"With the volatility in the stock market and especially the cannabis sector these days, one way to invest for the long-term is to buy a basket of stocks. The sector has had so many pitfalls due to regulations and company missteps that buying multiple stocks helps reduce any company specific risk and increases the odds of picking a couple of long-term winners in the sector. Investors should look at this as how a lot of the market participants invest in the biotech space. Picking winners in the sector can be difficult due to binary outcomes around drug testing and approvals. Investors buy baskets of biotech stocks since no investor wants to risk all of their capital to only one stock that could have a surprise negative outcome on a trial or FDA approval. While the cannabis sector doesn’t have the same binary risk, the market does have a ton of regulatory risk and splitting up investments between Canadian and U.S. companies helps reduce the risk of any negative outcome in one country. In addition, the market has bounced around from a shift to high THC value brands from an expectation for premium cannabis strains with moderate THC levels.","APH,APHA",en,Nasdaq

Roosevelt signed the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 which prohibited cannabis entirely. Prior to then, cannabis was primarily used as an herbal medicine to treat ailments. However, due to the biological nature of the THC or tetrahydrocannabinol compound, cannabis was deemed as a drug by prior administrations. By the early 1990s, a handful of states began to legalize cannabis for strictly medicinal purposes as California became the first state to do so back in 1996 with the approval of Proposition 215. After California's ruling, numerous states began to follow suit and also legalized medical cannabis. Then in 2012, the cannabis industry was completely reshaped after Colorado and Washington both legalized recreational cannabis. Now, there are 33 states that have legalized medical cannabis while 10 states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational use as well. Following in its steps, a string of countries also began to legalize cannabis for medicinal purposes.","APH,APHA",en,Benzinga

Rhode Island offers a clear example of why the cannabis industry, which is already seeing major demand, is experiencing huge growth and the addition of a whole new infrastructure sprouting up to service the new markets. Legal cannabis companies impacted in the grower and producer category with a view to supplying medical marijuana include Aphria (NYSE: APHA ) (TSX: APHA ), AmeriCann, Inc. (OTC: ACAN ), and Aurora Cannabis (TSX: ACB ) (NYSE: ACB ). And while state lawmakers in Rhode Island consider legalizing recreational weed, sales of medical marijuana have gone through the ceiling – surpassing all expectations. Based on the shifting attitudes towards legalization and growth in medical demand, marijuana focused companies have been realizing a significant lift.","APH,APHA",en,Benzinga

2019-04-01 08:00:00-05:00,Cannabis Continues to Garner Attention with the Rapid Expansion of CBD Products,"NEW YORK , April 1, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Cannabis has become one of the most controversial topics on many countries' political agendas. Cannabis is still internationally illegal under regulatory statutes, but clinical trials and research have led countries to explore opportunities within the medical cannabis market. However, the recreational market is still widely being heavily enforced. Nonetheless, certain regions have moved to decriminalize, or even fully legalize, recreational cannabis use. Unlike marijuana, hemp's main component is CBD. While THC provides psychoactive effects to consumers, CBD does not induce psychoactive effects, but provide a therapeutic and relaxing effect akin to that of THC. Furthermore, because CBD does not provide any psychoactive effects, many countries have allowed personal use of the CBD as long as it contains less than 0.3% THC. According to data compiled by Hemp Business Journal, a division of New Frontier Data, the total sales for the U.S. hemp industry totaled USD 820 Million and is expected to grow to reach USD 1.9 Billion by 2022.","APH,APHA",en,Benzinga

On the other hand, the state of New Jersey cancelled its vote on a bill that would legalize recreational cannabis due to a lack of support from legislators. “There have been so many advancements in cannabis, that many in the industry just feel like there will be no barriers in the way,” Debra Borchard, CEO of Green Market Report, told Benzinga. “However, New Jersey was a good reminder that there are still lots of people with concerns. It's still an infant industry with a long way to go.” Commenting on the SAFE Banking Act, Kyle Detwiler, CEO of Northern Swan Holdings said, “This is a great step forward for the industry as a whole, and this should improve efficiency and worker safety… We hope this is a stepping stone towards full legalization which will allow greater competition, product innovation and patient health.” The Cannabis Capital Conference is coming back to Toronto April 17-18!","APH,APHA,APDN",en,Benzinga

More than 1.5 billion people suffer from the effects of chronic pain and it is the number one cause of long-term disability in the U.S, according to TheGoodBody. Additionally, the severe effects of chronic pain have been linked to other problems such as depression and trouble sleeping. Traditionally, people could simply take non-prescription drugs such as acetaminophen or anti-inflammatory pills like ibuprofens to moderately suppress the pain. However, more severe cases can require stronger drugs like anti-anxiety pills or muscle relaxants. The issue revolving around these drugs is largely centered around the side effects they pose. Research has shown that some of these drugs can have detrimental and deteriorating effects on one's body. The concern over the constant use of traditional chronic pain treatments has led to the emergence of medical cannabis. Now, many advocates are looking to have cannabis as a potential registered medical treatment.","APH,APHA",en,Benzinga
