Growing environmental concerns have prompted governments and automotive manufacturers to shift to EVs as a way to combat negative environmental impacts. For instance, the U.S. government offers EV owners a federal tax credit for taking the step towards helping the environment. Moreover, the European Union has implemented regulations in order to limit the amount of diesel-powered vehicles on the road and eventually plans to transition to a fully electric system. A report by the European Environment Agency (EEA) also confirmed that the emission released from EVs are approximately 17% to 30% less than the emissions from petrol and diesel vehicles. The EEA says that EVs are much better for local air quality control due to their zero exhaust emissions at street levels. In addition, EVs are more environmentally efficient because they run on battery packs like lithium-ion battery packs, which are most commonly used within EVs.",FMC,en,Benzinga
