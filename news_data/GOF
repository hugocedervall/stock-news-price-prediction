2020-04-20 08:52:30-05:00,"The novel coronavirus wasn’t designed in a lab, so stop sharing conspiracy videos","Some coronavirus conspiracy theories push the idea that China may have developed the COVID-19 virus in a lab, using existing studies about SARS and other coronaviruses as proof that humans can genetically engineer novel viruses. Research does exist that proves coronavirus strains from bats could mutate to jump to humans. Still, a 2015 study explained the need to observe this family of viruses in the aftermath of the SERS and MERS epidemics to prevent other outbreaks. A new study published a few weeks ago confirmed that the genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus isn't similar to anything else, completely eliminating the possibility that the virus might have been created in a lab. Visit BGR's homepage for more stories . You should be more than familiar with all the measures you can take to reduce the risk of getting infected with the novel coronavirus. Wash your hands frequently with soap for at least 20 seconds, disinfect surfaces, avoid getting close to other people and self-isolate if possible.",GOF,en,BGR.com

2019-03-09 16:05:00-05:00,Our Own Government Is Quietly Funding Bird Flu Research That Could End Up Killing Us All,"Authored by Dagny Taggart via The Organic Prepper blog, Back in 2014, due to safety concerns, the government suspended dangerous research that could make the bird flu virus more easily transmitted to humans. It was a wise decision, but unfortunately, short-lived. In February, Science Magazine revealed a troubling discovery: Last year, a U.S. government review panel decided to let the research resume. They actually want scientists to figure out how to make the avian flu more likely to kill us all and what’s more, they’re not telling us why. Do they want a pandemic? Because this is how you get a pandemic. Anyone who’s read a book like The Stand knows this is how you get a pandemic. Not only did the government approve the experiments, but they are also paying for them. Here are additional details from The New York Times : Two research teams, in Wisconsin and the Netherlands, have been told by the Department of Health and Human Services that their work is eligible for research funding from the United States government.",GOF,en,Zero Hedge
