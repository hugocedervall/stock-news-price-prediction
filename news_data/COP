Normally, currencies of major commodity exporters such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, New Zealand, Russia and South Africa track indices weighted to reflect the economic importance of their various raw materials exports. So far in 2020, some of these currencies, notably the Australian and New Zealand dollars (AUD and NZD, respectively) have continued to track their commodity indices closely. Other currencies, such as the Brazilian real (BRL), Chilean peso (CHL) and South African rand (ZAR) have sharply underperformed their respective commodity indices. Currencies like the Canadian dollar (CAD), Russian ruble (RUB) and Colombian peso (COP) fall into an intermediate category. The key determinant in whether a currency has kept pace with its commodity index appears to be the rate of COVID-19 infections.

The plan relies heavily on capturing carbon dioxide and burying it, a technology that’s so far been prohibitively expensive.The announcement comes weeks after U.S. rival ConocoPhillips unveiled plans to curb climate-damaging pollution from its operations but didn’t address emissions generated by customers. The latter account for about 80% of the total emissions bill from a barrel of crude.American oil producers have been hesitant to adopt the sort of aggressive climate goals of European peers, in part because it would require a pivot away from the shale revolution that made U.S. oil production relevant again in global markets.Occidental’s announcement is significant because the company has one of the biggest footprints in the Permian Basin, the sprawling oil field beneath Texas and New Mexico that produces more crude than any other region on the continent.",COP,en,Yahoo Finance

It’s reminiscent of the one in the late 1990s, just as the Internet bubble was exploding. But don’t expect the stocks to rally this time. Parallels between tech in the 1990s and today are common. But there’s been little mention of what the energy sector went through at the same time and how it suddenly looks so familiar. History’s repeating itself as it appears energy can’t attract investors -- again. Then as now, the backdrop to energy’s M&A boom is a collapse in oil prices. The difference this time, however, is the deals are happening at a quarter of the traditional premiums. During this pandemic era, four deals have already emerged: Chevron’s takeover of Noble Energy, ConocoPhillips’s acquisition of Concho Resources, Pioneer Natural Resources’s purchase of Parsley Energy and Devon Energy’s merger with WPX Energy.",COP,en,Zero Hedge

Here are the 11 deals the bank says are most likely.,"Summary List Placement Hammered by a collapse in oil prices, the energy industry is entering a new phase focused on returns, which is likely to bring a wave of consolidation, analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note Wednesday. Deals could help US oil companies Exxon and Chevron diversify and build out their clean-energy assets, they said. ""European peers have begun to reposition portfolios away from oil & gas production,"" the analysts said in the note. ""Majors in the US have been slower to adapt despite sharing similar advantages of scale. Focusing on M&A in the power sector, companies with renewable development capabilities could be particularly attractive alternatives to oil & gas."" Today, the energy industry remains fragmented, the analysts said, resulting in a recent spike in deals. Most notably, Chevron acquired Noble Energy in early October through a $5 billion all-stock deal, while shale giants Devon Energy and WPX Energy announced plans to merge in late September. Read more: Layoffs, bankruptcies, and dividend cuts: We're tracking how 20 energy giants from Shell to Exxon are responding to the collapse in oil prices ""M&A has picked up again and, largely for the first time in recent memory, been rewarded by the market,"" Morgan Stanley said.

Crude rebounded to back near $40 a barrel by the end of Q2 and remains right around there as of mid-July, still not enough to rescue the sector from what are likely to be horrific earnings results. As of last week, research firm FactSet pegged the average Q2 earnings per share loss for S&P 500 Energy firms at 149.9% vs. a year ago.

2020-06-09 09:45:00-05:00,Oil prices are recovering faster than anyone expected. 4 Wall Street banks explain what that means for the energy economy — and share the stocks poised to benefit from the recovery.,"After crashing in March, the price of crude oil is recovering faster than banks initially predicted. Some producers that were forced to pare back oil production are already reversing cuts as a result. Still, don't expect oil demand to fully recover before the end of next year, analysts say. It could take even longer before US production grows. For more stories like this, sign up here for our weekly energy newsletter, Power Line . It was a devastating spring for oil markets, as some futures reached record lows and companies responded by laying off staff, slashing dividends , and cutting billions from annual budgets. But now there's some good news: The price of crude is rising fast — faster than investors expected. The US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate (WTI), posted its sharpest monthly gains on record in May. And when markets opened Tuesday morning, just days after OPEC Plus agreed to extend record supply cuts through July, WTI was trading at about $38 a barrel — up another 8% or so, since the start of June. ""The oversupply, which sent WTI oil prices into the negative earlier this year, is a thing of the past, as long as OPEC+ compliance stays strong and the oil demand recovery trajectory isn't radically altered,"" the research firm Rystad Energy said in a statement on Monday.",COP,en,Business Insider

2020-05-12 00:44:46-05:00,Argentina: Unconventional Activity Update,"The year 2020 has been filled with surprises as the COVID-19 pandemic spreads worldwide, leaving many homebound, resulting in a negative impact for many industries and ultimately leading to a decline in oil and gas demand across the globe. The pandemic paired with a supply surplus has dramatically lowered the oil price and left the energy industry in a difficult position. Argentina's hydrocarbon sector is no exception. Although Argentina has been producing from conventional formations since 1920's, conventional production has been steadily declining since 2007. Once operators started exploring different drilling techniques and successfully drilled the first unconventional well in 2010, new possibilities opened up for the future of Argentina's energy industry both in the tight gas and shale regions. Over the years, both international and local operators have applied different frac parameters in the Vaca Muerta play as they work to understand its geologic and reservoir properties. Local operators have followed the example of national oil company, YPF, while major companies such as ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, and Chevron, have even taken their unconventional development experience used in their North America assets and have applied it to Argentina to expand and improve their portfolios.",COP,en,IHS Markit
