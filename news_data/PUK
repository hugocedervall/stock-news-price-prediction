Si todo va según lo previsto y no encuentra ningún impedimento, como tampoco lo tuvo hace tan solo cinco meses para unirse a JP Morgan, Vereker, de 53 años de edad, tendrá que coger por los cuernos el lento negocio de Santander en Reino Unido de ayudar a implementar un programa de reducción de costos de 1.000 millones de euros en Europa.
