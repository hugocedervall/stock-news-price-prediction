2020-11-18 15:30:00.000,Cutting the ‘Total Cost of Electrification’ for EV Bus and Truck Fleets,"Electric trucks and buses may be approaching cost parity with their fossil-fueled counterparts, and they’re certainly cheaper to fuel over the long run — and that’s not counting their carbon and pollution emissions benefits. But that’s just a slice of the costs of switching bus and truck fleets from fossil fuels to batteries. Unexpected costs and bottlenecks in charging infrastructure, fleet operations and maintenance, and permitting and financing weigh on cities and states mandating electric bus fleets, or private companies with large-scale delivery truck electrification goals. Solving for this “total cost of electrification” equation will be a critical step in pushing EV trucks and buses from the margins to the mainstream in the coming decade, according to a report released Wednesday by Environmental Defense Fund, MJ Bradley and Vivid Economics. “We’re seeing the technology increasingly ready, and capital increasingly eager to invest in sustainability” via fleet electrification, Andy Darrell, EDF’s chief of global energy and finance strategy, said in an interview. “And yet the deployment, especially in the medium and heavy-duty sector, might not be moving as quickly as we’d like to achieve big climate goals.” Estimates on the global market for electric trucks and buses range into the tens of billions of dollars over the coming decade, he noted.",ACM,en,Green Technology Media

2020-11-05 00:01:25.000,How collaboration is critical to tackling fleet EV range anxiety,"Range anxiety might make compelling television, but in the business world electric vehicle infrastructure needs to get connected, says AECOM’s Robert Spencer. There's a definite relationship between winter drawing in, increasing lock down and the amount of escapism I seek through television. Recently, one such escape has been watching Ewan McGregor ride an electric motorbike through South America on the Long Way Up. As McGregor and his companion Charley Boorman snake through southern Patagonia, The Andes, and the Atacama Desert on prototype electric Harley-Davidsons, the story becomes as much about how they will complete that day's journey on diminishing EV power as the landscapes they ride through. The series offers a blindingly stark lesson to anyone apprehensive about the need to invest in EV infrastructure: it is virtually impossible to ‘wing it' when it comes to EV charging. If infrastructure isn't organised and connected, charging becomes chaotic and problematic. Cue scenes of the intrepid duo banging on door of a closed hotel in the pursuit of a few watts of electricity to continue their journey and the relief when they reach one of the charging points specially installed along their route by EV firm Rivian.",ACM,en,BusinessGreen

With infrastructure responsible for 16 per cent of the UK's total carbon emissions, as well as a further 37 per cent often attributable to the materials and energy which are required to build, maintain and operate infrastructure, it is imperative that focus is applied on how we build. One way this can be achieved is by driving a circular economy approach when planning and delivering infrastructure projects. Implementing a circular approach in line with net zero goals can help the UK infrastructure sector reduce carbon emissions by up to 50 per cent as well as cut overhead costs and support a more resilient supply chain. While deploying new materials will be unavoidable at times, reducing carbon emissions by almost 50 per cent can still be achieved throughout a circular design process.",ACM,en,BusinessGreen

However, as lockdown eases and journeys and industrial activities recommence, it is likely this will rise and the amount of carbon that is reproduced will cause even more damage to planetary systems. As we emerge from the pandemic, there is a huge responsibility on businesses to explore how they can contribute to a sustainable future. This can be done by implementing a circular economy approach when building or adapting new and existing buildings. Moving towards this approach has the potential to reduce the amount of pressure on the environment, improve the supply of materials, stimulate innovation and boost economic growth.

The shift to net zero has been ""quite a psychological one"", he reflects. ""When we had the 80 per cent target, there was the general feeling in business that as long as things were going generally in the right direction, we were all playing our part. Whereas with the net zero target, there is really nowhere to hide. Every single sector has to leave no stone unturned in terms of innovation, motivation, and playing its part."" This, of course, includes the EIC's membership from across the UK's environmental services sector, which Farrow stresses must ""walk the talk"" and implement ambitious corporate sustainability goals that align with the government's plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero within 30 years.",ACM,en,BusinessGreen

And if it achieves what it promises, we could now be looking at a once-in-a-generation chance to make our transport systems and the way people and goods move around substantially more sustainable. The government has set out its plan to decarbonise transport, one which Transport Secretary Grant Shapps admits will require a ""step-change in both the breadth and scale of ambition"" to meet the challenge. What makes it extraordinary is that the government has set out a vision for a future society where public transport and active travel ""will be the natural first choice for our daily activitie"". Shapps writes in the plan: ""We will use our cars less and be able to rely on a convenient, cost-effective and coherent public transport network."" The vision includes the transformation of 'last-mile' deliveries and optimising logistical efficiency, with emphasis on digital and collaborative business solutions.",ACM,en,BusinessGreen

The US construction and engineering consultancy giant has set its sights on cutting greenhouse gases from within its own business and the energy it purchases - known as Scope 1 and 2 emissions - by 20 per cent by 2025, with 2018 as a baseline year, it revealed last week. Moreover, the firm said it was targeting a reduction in emissions across its value chain, known as its Scope 3 emissions, by 10 per cent over the same time frame ""in line with current best practices"". In order to achieve the goals, AECOM said it would work closely with its most significant suppliers to phase out inefficient fleet vehicles, pursue low carbon vehicle technologies, combat emissions throughout its real estate portfolio, prioritise energy efficiency and renewables for its offices, and help to push its suppliers towards setting their own science-based emissions targets.

From Victorian sewers and railway lines to Roman Roads, it is fair to say that most infrastructure in the UK has an old footprint. Infrastructure enhancements typically take place through a process of accretion and maintenance. New infrastructure is typically created with a design life specification in mind - an airport runway might be expected to last for 30 years before needing significant refurbishment, meanwhile larger linear assets like the Thames Tideway Tunnel or Crossrail will last longer - around 120 years - due to various engineering specifications and longevity of materials. It has not been anticipated that in 2140 a group of elite construction disassembly enforcers will go around dismantling these big, bulky assets. Our infrastructure assets are essentially expected to go on as they are, providing an enduring public service to move around people, water, sewerage, electrons, locomotives, or whatever it is that the infrastructure was designed to convey.",ACM,en,BusinessGreen
