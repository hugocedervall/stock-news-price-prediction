Here are 5 other established food brands that could be acquired next as companies look to put cash from coronavirus-driven sales to use.,"Summary List Placement There's a paradox today for big food companies: Many are reporting their best sales in years and piling up cash as consumers eat more at home — but using that cash to make acquisitions has become trickier than it was before COVID-19. Even as products like mac n' cheese, cold cuts, and other processed and shelf-stable foods fly off the shelves, experts say companies are likely to be cautious about taking on new operations through acquisitions. Though a few major food deals have closed in 2020, such as Mondelez's $1.2 billion purchase of Give and Go , which makes frozen baked goods that can be thawed before retailers and restaurants sell them, there have been fewer acquisitions of brands by big food companies since coronavirus shook consumer habits and financial markets starting this spring.

Now, those same companies are bolstering production in anticipation of another spike in grocery buying this winter as COVID-19 cases rise again.

Pipoca é um dos petiscos mais populares do Brasil Tiago Queiroz/Estadão Conteúdo Simples de se fazer, parceira ideal dos filmes e a ponta de uma atividade que gera bilhões para o país. A pipoca é praticamente um patrimônio do brasileiro. Não por acaso, o país é o segundo maior consumidor mundial do petisco, atrás apenas dos Estados Unidos. E a procura cresceu na quarentena. Na última década, o país teve um salto de cerca de 40% na produção de milho. Um dos motivos é o “casamento” vitorioso com a soja, que é o grão mais cultivado e mais exportado do país. Os agricultores mudaram o calendário de plantio do milho. Se antes, ele concorria com a soja pelo plantio no verão, agora ele é cultivado na sequência. Isso criou uma dupla imbatível tanto em produtividade quanto em renda. O milho é o terceiro produto do campo que mais traz renda ao agronegócio, com a expectativa de movimentar R$ 75 bilhões neste ano, ficando atrás da soja (R$ 167 bilhões) e do boi gordo (R$ 101 bilhões), segundo o Ministério da Agricultura.",GIS,pt,Globo

Here's how worried you should be.,"A new round of tests from the Environmental Working Group found traces of the weed-killer glyphosate in 6 types of Cheerios, 14 Nature Valley products, and Fiber One's oatmeal raisin soft-baked cookies.

Courts have already ruled in favor of the plaintiff in three verdicts, but it's important to separate these cases from scientific evidence. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

2019-03-20 12:21:00-05:00,The weed-killing chemical involved in a Monsanto lawsuit was found in Cheerios and Quaker Oats products. Here's how worried you should be.,"A round of tests from the nonprofit Environmental Working Group found the presence of a weed-killer in breakfast foods like Cheerios and Quaker Oats products. The chemical in question, known as glyphosate, has been tentatively linked to cancer, though many scientists argue that the evidence isn't conclusive. The group's latest report said that all but two of the 28 samples showed harmful levels of glyphosate, but their safety threshold is far more stringent than the Environmental Protection Agency's standard. As the scientific community awaits further research, consumers are left to decide whether the products pose a risk. Over the past year, the Environmental Working Group has conducted multiple tests to determine the presence of weed-killer in certain breakfast foods. In August, the group published a report that found traces of glyphosate , the most widely used agricultural pesticide in the world, in dozens of Quaker, Kellogg's, and General Mills products, including cereals like Cheerios and Lucky Charms.",GIS,en,Business Insider

Roundup's active ingredient is a widely-used agricultural pesticide called glyphosate, which has been tentatively linked to cancer. The verdict represents a major landmark in an ongoing legislative battle against Monsanto (recently acquired by Bayer), which is being sued by thousands of other plaintiffs. Tuesday ushered in another landmark verdict in the wave of lawsuits against Monsanto, the agrochemical giant behind the popular herbicide, Roundup, which has been accused of causing cancer. On March 19, a federal j ury ruled that Roundup was a ""substantial"" contributor to 70-year-old Edwin Hardeman's cancer diagnosis in 2015 . Hardeman used the weed-killer to tend his property for more than two dec ades. He is one of thousands of plaintiffs who have filed similar claims against Monsanto, which was recently acquired by Bayer.
