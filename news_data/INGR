2020-10-14 03:41:59-05:00,The founder of the world's first vegan ETF explains how her market-beating fund is naturally built to include the pandemic's biggest winners — and why industry titans like Facebook and Uber fit the bill,"Summary List Placement When the unique VEGN ticker hit the New York Stock Exchange in September 2019, it caught the attention of both financial commentators and investors. The US Vegan Climate exchange-traded fund had the goal of becoming a sustainable alternative to the S&P 500 that was both cruelty-free and climate-conscious. Many analysts and investors speculated about the kind of performance a large-cap passive-fund could deliver when it was barred from holding any stocks with exposure to animal testing, or animal-derived products, fossil fuels, or any company with links to defense, or evidence of human rights abuses in their supply chain. This would have immediately ruled out a lot of commonly-held names in the energy, fashion, pharmaceutical, and other consumer sectors. But a year on, the Vegan ETF is beating its S&P 500 benchmark and founder Claire Smith's 34 years of experience in the financial services industry are paying off. The ETF has returned 27.69% on market price against the S&P 500 Index's 19.75% through to 31st August 2020.
