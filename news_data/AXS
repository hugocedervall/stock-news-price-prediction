RIL has unveiled a detailed plan to carve out its Oil-to-Chemicals (O2C) business into a separate unit on a slump sale basis to attract strategic investors. As per the plan, assets and liabilities pertaining to refining, petrochemicals, fuel retail (51 per cent stake) and bulk wholesale marketing businesses will be transferred to a new entity. RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani at the company's AGM had highlighted the strategic investment by Saudi Aramco for a 20 per cent stake which got delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic with the latter still performing due diligence. The plan is subject to NCLT approval and is expected to be completed by early 2021. Axis Capital said in a research note, ""We expect RIL to attract many other strategic investors into its O2C business given it provides strong foothold in India with the fastest growing fuels market where passenger cars are expected to grow ~6x over the next two decades. ""Implementation of the 'New Energy and New Materials' strategy adopted at the AGM will make it more lucrative given the low per-capita petchem and energy use."" As per the report, RIL believes that its O2C business attracts specific set of investors and strategic partners given the different risk and return expectations against the other businesses (digital services, retail, financial services and E&P).

They said the telecom operator was close to profitability at the operational level in the January-March period, when it was dragged by the exceptional charges related to statutory dues and write-down on 3G gear. Its net loss before exceptional items during the quarter stood at Rs 471 crore, down from Rs 1,181 crore a year ago.“We expect Bharti Airtel will be able to generate profit over two-three quarters and exit 2020 with net positive PAT (profit after tax),” said a Mumbai-based analyst, who did not wish to be identified.

This is not a bail-out for businesses but for PSU banks and other NBFCs like IL&FS.

Expectations that rains would be normal this monsoon season should also lift buying power in the villages. The federal cabinet, in its first meeting after Prime Minister Narendra Modi returned to power with a stronger mandate, last week decided that the government would cover 145 million farmers under the PM Kisan scheme, and irrespective of their land holdings will transfer Rs 6,000 to their bank accounts. The revised programme will now cover 20 million additional farmers. “Higher MSPs and rural stimulus would put more money in the pockets of rural consumers and boost consumerism. The liquidity situation in the market is improving now and a repo rate cut would further improve the situation,” said the homegrown packaged consumer products company Dabur India’s chief executive Mohit Malhotra. 69658008 The maker of Vatika shampoo and Real juices, which derives 45% of its overall domestic sales in the rural areas, however flagged unemployment as a concern. “The unemployment rate continues to be high and the government must take decisive steps now to address this issue,” Malhotra said.",AXS,en,The Economic Times India

2019-05-06 21:02:49-05:00,India’s consumption story losing the plot,"ET Intelligence Group: Consumption is sputtering across a range of products including cars, two-wheelers, air travel and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), with volumes dropping to multi-quarter lows. The decline in demand stems from an income growth slump in urban and rural areas that’s forced people to curb spending, falling money supply in the economy and rising uncertainty over how customers will respond to regulatory action, experts said. The next government may need to prime the pump as consumption has been one of the engines that has been driving the economy in the absence of private investment and exports.“You can’t say FMCG is recession proof but it is recession resistant,” said Hindustan Unilever chairman Sanjiv Mehta during a press briefing after March quarter results. “People don’t stop bathing or cleaning their teeth when conditions become tough.

2019-03-30 12:30:00-05:00,How Arvind Ltd is betting on newer businesses to move up the value chain,"Blue jeans have been synonymous with Arvind Ltd for more than three decades. After all, the 88-year-old Ahmedabad-based textile company was the first to manufacture the indigo-dyed blue denim cloth in the country. Sanjay Lalbhai, 62, now chairman of Arvind, recalls how the first lot of indigo-dyed denim, made by Arvind sometime between late 1985 and 1986, was technically not denim at all. A thick white cotton twill was printed indigo-blue using a saree-printing machine and then tested to see if it washed like denim. Lalbhai explains that for a fabric to be considered authentic blue denim, the warp or the longitudinal yarn in the fabric has to be dyed with indigo before the weaving. The transverse thread, or the weft, must be white. The afterwash look of the fabric is the key. By 1986, the Arvind top brass had been mulling over denim options for two years. That journey had started a few years earlier when former adman-turned-entrepreneur Rajiv Badlani set up the Flying Machine jeans brand in 1980.",AXS,en,The Economic Times India

The change in Mindtree's stance comes after a period of continued tirade against 'usurper' L&T and its hostile takeover bid.The battle has just began and it's too premature to say what will eventually happen, Natarajan said when asked if the cause was already lost. He explained why more than the bid itself he finds fault with the timing of it. The time L&T chose for its bid is worrisome, he said.""Mindtree did all the early work, suffered low margins for years and now it's poised to clock top-shelf growth in the next couple of years,"" is how Natarajan put in perspective the high stakes involved.""We tilled the land, fertilised it, put the right seeds, and now it may give us a great yield.",AXS,en,The Economic Times India

Lawyers, investment bankers and other market observers say that this could be because L&T may want to avoid being saddled with Mindtree shares in the unlikely event of the approvals not coming through.Founders of Mindtree have publicly attacked L&T’s acquisition proposal despite the latter claiming that it would let the Bengaluru-based firm run independently. L&T needs to own around 5 per cent more stake in Mindtree to reach the 25 per cent threshold that will trigger an open offer. It has placed an order with its stock broker Axis Capital to buy shares worth 15 per cent from the market on the condition that these transactions will be done only after necessary approvals from regulators.The public announcement says that the 15 per cent will be bought on exchanges “only after the acquirer has informed the stockbroker of the receipt of relevant approvals required from various regulatory authorities and until such period as permitted under applicable laws (including Sebi SAST Regulation).” 68607433 JN Gupta, founder of Stakeholders Empowerment Services and former executive director of Securities and Exchange Board of India criticised L&T for attaching conditions to stock market purchases since it means that all risks have been transferred to other stakeholders and the acquirer is not taking any risks. “The order to buy shares is conditional and not capable of being executed as on date.",AXS,en,The Economic Times India
