Dipan Mehta explains,"Margin of safety is not there for a whole host of consumption-related stocks, says Founder & Director, Elixir Equities.Would you be a buyer in liquor stocks? This is one space where we have realised that the consumption patterns have not changed. No, I do not think so. Till we do not have the parties and functions or the other entertainment going in terms of restaurants and pubs, I think consumption will remain lowkey. Although we are seeing the queues in front of liquor shops, it does not necessarily mean that sales are back to normal levels. It will take a while for normalcy to return and a lot of the growth was coming on account of causal drinking, which will not happen at home. So I am not that positive on liquor stocks unless we have handled this Covid-19 pandemic. Another thing to add is that the stocks are extremely richly valued.

Conceived by former US Federal Reserve Board chairman Greenspan in the late 1970s, the index suggests that declines in the sale of men’s underwear indicate a poor overall state of the economy, while upswings reflect the opposite.Quarterly performance at the top four listed innerwear firms were the weakest in a decade. Sales of Page Industries, which sells the Jockey brand of innerwear, grew 2%, its slowest expansion since 2008. That of Dollar Industries and VIP Clothing declined 4% and 20%, respectively.
