It was “the craziest price action I’ve seen in my nine years covering the space,” Jefferies shipping analyst Randy Giveans told FreightWaves. There have been plenty of bad days for tanker stocks, including the day before. Sometimes, you could blame bad results. Sometimes, you could blame the coronavirus — negative macro momentum was just too strong. And sometimes, you could blame rising oil prices, which make floating storage less attractive, a negative for tanker demand. But whodunit this time?

Product-tanker spot rates have risen sharply over the past week, continuing a run of strong performance at a time when freight pricing in many other vessel categories has collapsed. ""The fourth quarter displayed significantly improved market conditions across all product market segments, showing increased rates at levels not enjoyed since 2015,"" said Lars Dencker Nielsen, chief commercial officer of product-tanker owner Scorpio Tankers (NYSE: STNG ), on the company's quarterly conference call on Wednesday.

2020-01-06 11:01:27-05:00,Outlook 2020: Top Questions For Ocean Shipping,"Ocean shipping begins the year with unusually high optimism in the crude-tanker sector and very strong sentiment in the product-tanker and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) segments. But fundamentals in markets outside of petroleum transport are not nearly as firm, and in general, ocean shipping boasts a long history of surprises to the downside. As Robert Bugbee, president of Scorpio Tankers (NYSE: STNG ) and Scorpio Bulkers (NYSE: SALT ), once said in an interview: ""There have always been events in shipping you can't foresee … wonderful and terrifying things. World events smash us to the floor and inflict amazing pain, then we have great things happen and we're back to making money again."" In a high-stakes business that's this unpredictable, it's vital to keep a sharp watch on the top variables and wild cards you can foresee, and mentally prepare yourself to be surprised by those you can't. Following are some of the most important ""devil's advocate"" questions for ocean shipping to consider in 2020: What Will Happen With Demand?",STNG,en,Benzinga Feeds
2019-12-30 09:46:35-05:00,2019 Recap: Top Ocean Shipping Interviews Of The Year,"If you want to know what's really happening in ocean shipping, look to what the executives on the front lines of this global business are saying. And when they give an answer that's obviously ""talking their book,"" ignore it and move on to their next response. This year, FreightWaves conducted exclusive interviews with some of the top executives in ocean shipping, as well as the leading technology providers to the industry and the bankers who analyze it. These in-depth interviews offer market intelligence that's not available from any other source, and taken together, they provide multiple angles on the current state of play. Here's a rundown of the top ocean shipping interviews of 2019: Lois Zabrocky , CEO of crude- and product-tanker owner International Seaways (NYSE: INSW ) on the very latest IMO 2020 impacts: Click here. Robert Bugbee , president of Scorpio Tankers (NYSE: STNG ) and Scorpio Bulkers (NYSE: SALT ), on the potential shift ahead in ship ownership from Europe to Asia: Click here.",STNG,en,Benzinga Feeds
2019-12-27 14:14:56-05:00,Outlook 2020: Ocean Shipping Finance To Tighten Further,"Keep a close watch on ship finance in 2020. The amount of capital available to shipowners next year will determine vessel capacity growth in the medium term, and thus, future freight rates. In addition, near-term service reliability can hinge on funding access. If shipping companies cannot refinance maturing debt, ocean services can plunge into chaos, a la the 2016 Hanjin Shipping insolvency. If 2019 is any indication, there will be even less capital available to ocean shipping in 2020, it will be more costly to access and capital providers will be more discerning on who gets it. What's so unusual is that this funding contraction is coinciding with improved shipping-market fundamentals, particularly in crude-tanker, product-tanker and liquefied petroleum gas sectors. Stronger rates and lower default risks usually open the capital floodgates, creating new vessel capacity that ultimately kills the rate recovery. Not so this time, at least not yet. Bank Debt Down, Chinese Leasing Up The shipping industry has traditionally been financed by cheap loans from European commercial banks, complemented by owners' equity from retained earnings.",STNG,en,Benzinga Feeds
2019-12-10 15:50:59-05:00,"Q&A: Scorpio's Bugbee On ""Prexit,"" 2020 Outlook And Stock Rebound","There's no one else in the ocean shipping industry quite like Robert Bugbee, the president of three U.S.-listed companies with a combined market capitalization of $2.6 billion — Scorpio Tankers (NYSE: STNG ), Scorpio Bulkers (NYSE: SALT ) and Hermitage Offshore (NYSE: PSV ). As former president of OMI Corporation, he was part of a management team that pulled off a contender for ""shipping deal of the century."" OMI bought back 35% of its stock then sold the company at the peak of the boom in April 2007 for $2.2 billion to Teekay Corp . (NYSE: TK ) and Torm (NASDAQ: TRMD ). OMI shareholders including Bugbee walked away rich, while Teekay and Torm were stuck with fleets that collapsed in value amidst the 2008-09 financial crisis. What makes Bugbee different from other successful shipping executives is that he's not bound by the traditional reserved decorum of big industry names. He's the industry's id, its class clown, while still retaining the respect of peers and investors. Bugbee has been wearing a suit and the occasional tie of late, but in earlier years, he has moderated Marine Money panels in full costume, once as a beach bum, once as a football referee, and in 2013, as Sgt.",STNG,en,Benzinga Feeds
