The buying was largely driven by participation in several capital raises, mostly in the banking sector, taking the year-to-date 2020 FPI inflows up to $4.7 billion which was negative till July 2020. These inflows appear to have been driven by global liquidity and higher Emerging Market (EM) allocations due to a weak US dollar.

Net issuance of corporate debt surged globally as central banks including the Federal Reserve and Bank of England announced in March that they would begin purchasing corporate bonds, flooding the market with liquidity. In turn, companies hurt by pandemic-related lockdowns issued more debt to stay afloat. The outstanding supply of US investment-grade corporate bonds increased by approximately 10 per cent between 1 March and 26 June, according to the latest figures from MSCI. “This surge in issuance may partly reflect the needs of companies to fund existing operations while facing revenue shortfalls.

By some estimates, about Rs 10,000 crore worth of short-term passive inflows and Rs 40,000 crore in potential active inflows could be affected by the deferral in the rebalancing, an analyst described as a “foregone” conclusion.Stocks such as Larsen & Toubro, Asian Paints, Bajaj Finance, Nestle India, Divi’s Laboratories, Britannia, Tata Steel, Shree Cement and Bharti Infratel were expected to benefit the most from the rebalancing of India’s weightage.The delay would support stocks of Bajaj Auto, Infosys, TCS, HUL, HDFC, RIL and ICICI Bank, where weightage was expected to decrease due to the rebalancing.76740559According to an estimate by Morgan Stanley, the re-balancing could have increased India’s weight in the emerging market by 55 basis points (bps) and India’s foreign inclusion factor (FIF) could have increased from 0.39 to 0.42.India’s weight was scheduled for an upward revision by MSCI after the Centre changed the FPI limit for companies in October last year.",MSCI,en,Economic Times India

For those that have not read it, his message was simple, it is time to go all in on ESG. “In the near future – and sooner than most anticipate – there will be a significant reallocation of capital”, says Fink, whose call to action may well have set off a chain reaction across the fund management industry as an increasing number of managers are selecting funds that assertively screen out fossil fuels, demonstrating their commitment to sustainability.

And fiscal expansion can raise the kind of funding concerns that still afflict emerging nations, raising the prospect of credit rating downgrades and calls for international rescues. 74944164“We should be worried about emerging markets,” said Barry Eichengreen, a University of California Berkeley economist. In addition to suffering disproportionately from the collapse of commodity prices, supply chains, trade and spending, they’re facing “clearly, the mother of all sudden stops” in capital flows, he said.‘Original Sin’Eichengreen and fellow economist Ricardo Hausmann are famed for labeling the underlying cause of the late-1990s Asian financial crisis as the “original sin” of excessive reliance on borrowing in foreign currencies.While many emerging markets have worked hard to address that risk -- building local debt markets and accumulating foreign-exchange reserves as a buffer for times of trouble -- the same old problems keep resurfacing.",MSCI,en,Economic Times India

The initiative is just the beginning of a huge body of work, Varsani says, as MSCI plans to expand its universe of fixed income offerings over the coming months and years.

As it turns out, there were a lot: Remember, investors started the decade with US stocks near their post-crisis lows, with few anticipating the unbridled rebound that would come to pass during the ensuing months and years. Even more surprising was the drop in interest rates: Negative interest rates were a defining feature of the decade. But few expected them to persist as long as they did, nor did they expect Treasury yields to remain mired in the 1- and 2-handle territory for as long as they have.

Your research report is indicating that the budget addresses the near term growth challenges. What do you like and don’t like about the design of the budget?I am very happy with the budget. There were three big things that we were looking for; the first was taking opportunity of the low hanging fruit on the external side given the trade war between US and China. We were sensing that there was a lot of interest in investing in India, the government has attacked that head on, not only in equities but even in bonds.

Edited excerpts: It has been good for India in the last 45 days. You cannot find a fault line. But is this as good as it gets?For Sensex, 45,000 is a reasonable one-year forward target and that gives much more upside than we have for global emerging markets. So, a double digit upside more or less, whereas we have only 2% or 3% upside for global emerging markets. There is a number of things that India is going through. Obviously this government has come in for the second term. We have got an interest rate cutting cycle underway and we have got the oil price falling which is always helpful.

And while traders were happy to bid up risk assets for one more day on a variation of the same positive news that has hit wires - or Trump's twitter feed - for the past two months, they ignored a tweet from the editor in chief of China's Global Times who said that ""speculations of trade negotiations will be extended are inaccurate."" I learned from source close to China-US trade talks that speculations of trade negotiations will be extended are inaccurate.","MS,MSCI",en,Zero Hedge

The State of the Disunion should be of equal importance . Let’s start with the US, where President Trump is going to wheel out that hoary old cliché “bipartisanship” when he speaks tonight. Achieving that in the current US political climate is a challenge, perhaps an even greater challenge than Nancy Pelosi will have in keeping a neutral face while she sits right behind him. Let’s listen for clues on a possible emergency being declared to “build the wall”, as well as what is going on re: meeting Xi and Kim in Da Nang, Vietnam, and on infrastructure: it still seems amazing that two years into a real-estate developer’s presidency the only thing being talked about being built is that wall. Want another snap-shot of disunion? The good ship Brexit continues to trundle towards the 29 March iceberg with PM May’s “plan” being: (1) repeat the word “Brexit” every few hours; and (2) hope that at the last minute the EU blinks on the Irish border issue .",MSCI,en,Zero Hedge

Developed during the Great Depression as a premium writing instrument, the Blackwing became the preferred daily instrument for everyone from John Steinbeck to Quincy Jones, Truman Capote to Stephen Sondheim. Production stopped in 1998, and vintage examples go on eBay for +$30 apiece. If you want to delve into pencil-geekdom, there is a link at the end of this section with more information. Today we’ll sharpen only the proverbial pencil on the question of global equity valuations. After last year’s parlous performance in both Emerging Markets (down 19%) and EAFE (non-US developed equities, down 15%), how do the world’s stock markets shape up in terms of relative valuation to US equities? Three points on this topic: #1. The rest of the world’s equities markets do, in fact, trade at a significant discount to US stocks just now.",MSCI,en,Zero Hedge

The pound fluctuated and gilts fell before a no-confidence vote in Prime Minister Theresa May’s government… ... while S&P futures rose initially then faded some of their gains. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was flat, while MSCI’s main European Index gained 0.3 percent. Europe's Stoxx 600 Index was modestly in the green, led by banks and insurers following China’s plans to boost fiscal stimulus, cut taxes and shore up growth and President Mario Draghi’s comments that stimulus is still needed in the euro area. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 declined as investors contemplated May’s Brexit defeat and the pound squeeze higher continued.
