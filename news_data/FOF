2020-02-13 22:59:00-05:00,UOB Asset Management launches Malaysia’s first fixed income fund-of-funds,"PETALING JAYA : UOB Asset Management (Malaysia) Bhd has launched the country’s first fixed income fund-of-funds (FoF), enabling retail investors to access different fixed income funds through just one portfolio. An FoF is a collective investment scheme that invests in other funds instead of investing directly in securities, such as stocks and bonds. The United Global Income Allocator Fund (UGIAF) aims to provide retail investors with regular income and capital appreciation by allocating at least 80% of its portfolio to fixed income funds. The remaining 20% of the fund will be allocated to liquid assets such as money market instruments and deposits. The UGIAF is available in ringgit, Singapore dollar, Australian dollar and US dollar with an initial minimum investment of RM1,000, S$1,000, A$1,000 and US$1,000 respectively. UOB Asset Management CEO Lim Suet Ling said the UGIAF is suitable for retail investors who have a moderate risk tolerance over a medium- to long-term investment horizon. “[This] is the first FoF solution in Malaysia that enables retail investors to invest in a diverse range of fixed income funds through one portfolio. “Fixed income FoFs are typically available only to institutional investors such as pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, but retail investors can now also gain exposure to high-quality institutional fixed income funds previously not accessible to them,” she said in a statement.",FOF,en,The Sun Daily

2019-11-20 23:17:31-05:00,Unsure about asset allocation? These funds will work for you,"Financial planners are recommending asset allocation funds to first-time investors who want to start investing in equities as an asset class. They also work well as a core portfolio for investors who do not maintain the discipline of asset allocation, which plays a key role in determining portfolio returns.“Winners among asset classes keep rotating largely because they perform based on market cycles. For example, equity markets tend to generally perform well in expansionary economies, while the debt market tends to generally perform well in contracting economies,” said S Naren, chief investment officer, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund.Naren believes an optimal shift of allocation among asset classes ensures a smoother investment journey, which can be achieved by retail investors through investing in asset allocation schemes.As per a research paper “Determinants of Portfolio Performance II, An Update” published by Gary Brinston, Brian D Singer and Gilbert L Beebower, Financial Analysts Journal May-June 1991, it was found that allocation forms the key determinant for portfolio performance over a long run in 92% of the cases.",FOF,en,The Economic Times India
