The industry fears it could cascade into denial of refunds on taxes paid on inputs, as well as audits, probe and tax demand. The industry has sought immediate government intervention in the matter.According to industry estimates, 200-plus companies have some form of dispute on the definition of “intermediary” services. There is no GST levied on goods or services exported, but intermediary services are taxed even if supplied to foreign entities. Back-office services were in the pre-GST regime treated as exports and not taxed. GST authorities have started disputing the status of export earnings and are seeking to treat those as “intermediary” services. Industry body Nasscom has represented the matter to the finance and commerce ministries for expeditious resolution. “There are increasing cases where the GST authorities have aggressively interpreted the scope of intermediary services to cover ITeS/ BPM,” it said in a representation, seen by ET.The implication of treating ITeS/ BPM as “intermediary”, it said, was that exports get taxed at 18%.",G,en,Economic Times India

This is further evidence that we could be heading into a long-term and perhaps irreversible decline in gold mine production. According to the World Gold Council, total gold mine output in 2019 came in at 3,463.7 tons. A particularly weak fourth quarter drove the overall decline in gold production. Mine output fell 2% year-on-year in Q4 to 859.5 tons. According to the WGC, it was the lowest level of fourth-quarter mine output since Q4 2016. Gold production declined year-on-year in every quarter of 2019. Although last year marked the first absolute decline in gold production since 2008, it continues a general trend of falling mine output. Gold mine production was up a modest 77.72 tons between 2015 and 2016, 33.92 tons between 2016 and 2017, and 28 tons between 2017 and 2018.

Shares in Newmont have been climbing since Friday, when Barrick first revealed that it was considering making an offer.

Following the most recent hike in December 2018, Chairman Powell seemed hell bent on further tightening, saying “some further gradual increases” were in the cards. Then the stock market promptly fell nearly 20%. Investors were in panic mode and calling for the end of the world. The pain was too much... Last month, the Fed left rates unchanged... and Powell removed any language about further hikes. Already Powell is capitulating. The new chief economist for the International Monetary Fund praised the move, saying she sees “considerable and rising risks” to the global economy.
