Poppe, a General Motors Co. veteran who now runs the Michigan utility CMS Energy Corp., will be PG&E’s fourth leader in the past two years, taking over on Jan. 4., the company said Wednesday in a statement.Her task is monumental. Not only must she reform a sprawling enterprise that’s been found responsible for sparking numerous deadly wildfires, she has to regain the trust of the public and government officials including Governor Gavin Newsom, who had threatened to take over the company if it didn’t correct its “culture of ineptitude.” And she has to do it while cutting $1 billion in costs.“What we have to see is if can we change the course of this company,” Robert Flexon, chairman of the board at PG&E, said during a media call with reporters. “I believe Patti can.”Expensive HireCritics won’t be easy to win over.","CMSA,CMS",en,Yahoo Finance
2020-11-18 16:29:00-05:00,PG&E Picks New CEO to Lead it Through Post-Bankruptcy Challenges,"Pacific Gas & Electric has named Patti Poppe as its next CEO, asking the longtime Michigan utility executive to help restore public confidence in its ability to safely operate its Northern California grid and rebuild investors’ trust in its post-bankruptcy financial prospects. Poppe will take the lead at California’s largest utility in January, six months after it emerged from bankruptcy under a $59 billion reorganization plan that’s saddled it with billions of dollars of debt. In a prepared statement, the 52-year-old CEO of Consumers Energy and parent company CMS Energy said she was honored at the “opportunity to help lead the state’s clean energy future,” and eager to “join in the critical work of strengthening PG&E for California’s next generation and earning back the community’s trust.” PG&E has been under intense pressure from California Gov. Gavin Newsom and state lawmakers and regulators to improve its safety after a string of deadly wildfires in 2017 and 2018. The Nov. 2018 Camp Fire, the state’s deadliest to date, was sparked by a poorly maintained PG&E power line and caused tens of billions of dollars in liabilities which drove the company into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.","CMSA,CMS",en,Green Technology Media

2020-06-04 10:21:00-05:00,Utility stocks are a haven for investors in uncertain times. The CEO of a $3 billion asset manager reveals a decade-long trend that's boosting utilities — and shares his 3 top picks.,"The utilities sector has long been considered a haven for investors in uncertain times. In the next 5 to 10 years, utilities will benefit from cheap solar panels and wind turbines, according to Jay Rhame, who runs a $3 billion asset management firm. Rhame values growth over outright yield and favors companies with management teams that are skilled at cost control. He shares three of his top picks including NextEra Energy, CMS Energy, and Eversource. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . When cash is tight, you might not buy a new summer wardrobe or purchase a sports car, but chances are you'll still pay your bill for electricity, gas, and water. That's one reason why utility companies are seen as havens for investors in times of market uncertainty. Plus, many utilities are protected by government regulations and pay investors hefty dividends. But for Jay Rhame, who helms a $3 billion long-only asset management firm, utilities are not just about safety. They're also about growth. ""We're really excited about the utility sector,"" said Rhame, the chief executive of Reaves Asset Management, a firm focused on investing in essential services that's headquartered in Jersey City, New Jersey. ""The potential to remake almost the entire global electric grid and transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy is potentially a decades-long trend that will benefit utilities.""

Coronavirus has caused near-term volatility among utility stocks, but Morgan Stanley says investors should look through the noise.
