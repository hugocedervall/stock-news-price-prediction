China's Tianqi, one of the biggest producers of lithium chemicals used in electric-vehicle batteries, was due to repay a total US$1.88 billion by the end of November but secured a one-month extension, buying it time. On Tuesday, Tianqi said in an exchange filing that IGO Lithium Holdings would take a 49% stake in Tianqi Lithium Energy Australia (TLEA), with Tianqi retaining 51%. That gives IGO 24.99% in Greenbushes plus 49% in Tianqi's suspended Kwinana lithium hydroxide processing plant, both of which are in Western Australia, a source with knowledge of the deal said. The Chinese company said it plans to use the proceeds mostly to repay US$1.2 billion of the principal on a loan taken out to buy a stake in Chile's SQM in 2018, as well as associated interest.",ALB,en,The Sun Daily

2019-12-09 14:01:40-05:00,"UPDATE 1-Chile's November exports drop 12%, lithium and copper revenues down","Chile's export revenue fell 12% to $5.3 billion in November, the central bank said on Monday, more bad news for an ailing economy hammered by the worst unrest since the South American nation's return to democracy in 1990. Weeks of sometimes violent protests, riots, arson and looting have led to at least 26 deaths and billions in losses to private businesses and public infrastructure. The unrest prompted the central bank last week to slash forecasts for growth, investment and demand through 2020. The bad news for Chile was made worse by falling prices for both copper and lithium. Chile is the world's top producer of copper, and the No. 2 producer of lithium, both critical building blocks for electric vehicles. Revenue from copper exports plunged 8.7% in November to $2.772 billion, while lithium exports tumbled nearly 6% to $67 million. The country's vast copper mines have nonetheless largely maintained output despite more than 50 days of protests. Top lithium producers SQM and Albemarle have also said production had largely been spared.",ALB,en,Reuters
