2020-11-27 06:03:40-05:00,We will not rest until the companies behind the Grenfell fire are held to account | Karim Mussilhy,"The inquiry into that awful night is slowly revealing shocking evidence, and strengthening our pursuit of justice • Karim Mussilhy is a member of the survivors’ group Grenfell United What we witnessed more than three years ago seemed like a scene from a horror movie. One could be forgiven for thinking it was a freak accident. But the fire at Grenfell Tower was no accident – it was the result of years of neglect , deregulation and corporate greed . For me and other families who lost loved ones in Grenfell, there have been times in the last few years when we’ve wanted to scream and tear the world down. It’s taken patience beyond measure to wait for the evidence that we’ve been reading in private to finally make it into the public spotlight. We’ve now seen emails that appear to show that Arconic executives knew how dangerous their cladding was. And our lawyers are arguing that evidence shows the companies that made the insulation used fire-resistant materials in their safety tests to help them pass – and left this information out of marketing materials.",ARNC,en,The Guardian

On Monday the inquiry’s second phase opened with the revelation that Arconic, the cladding system’s manufacturer, knew five years before Grenfell’s refurbishment that its panels were “not suitable for use on building facades” in Europe because they did not meet safety standards. When much of the argument about the disaster’s causes is unavoidably technical, involving as it does details of construction contracts and building regulation, such straightforward language has an immediate impact. A series of emails from an Arconic official, cited in a statement from the main building contractor, Rydon, referred to the “bad behaviour” of the Reynobond PE 55 panels when fitted in cassette form – as they were at Grenfell – and added that it expected them to be put “out of market”.",ARNC,en,The Guardian

The second phase of the Grenfell Tower inquiry opens tomorrow, after the exposure of a conflict of interest that was not resolved until families threatened to withdraw from the process. The appointment of engineer Benita Mehra to the inquiry panel, linked as she was to the cladding firm Arconic, undermined trust and could have left the inquiry’s phase 2 findings open to legal challenge. Mehra has now resigned. Yet there are still serious questions to answer about the government’s appointment process to the inquiry panel, the due diligence carried out by the prime minister, and the initial failure to reverse the appointment once the conflict was exposed in the Guardian. “The government should never have put families in this situation,” said Grenfell United, the group representing many bereaved and survivors. “They failed to carry out basic checks and understand the importance and sensitivities around a fair and proper process.",ARNC,en,The Guardian

Analysts told Reuters this is one of the biggest assembly-line halts in several decades, could continue to cost Boeing $1 billion per month despite the production freeze.
