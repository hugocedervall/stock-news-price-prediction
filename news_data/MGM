Now, all of the casinos are temporarily closed – but the private-equity giant should still make money from rent on three of the properties. Its most recent deal left four banks on the hook for $1.9 billion of debt that they're struggling to syndicate. Click here for more BI Prime stories . Blackstone poured billions into a 1.5-mile stretch of Las Vegas in the last five years. The private-equity giant bought two casinos outright and purchased interests in two others as it bet big on a simple investing thesis that extended to strategies beyond real estate: people would pay to get out of the house for entertainment. But with the lights shut off across Sin City due to a state order in response to the coronavirus pandemic, Blackstone can't make money from any of its casinos for the foreseeable future. But despite the dark backdrop, the private-equity giant has an income stream even as the casinos are closed: hundreds of millions in guaranteed annual rent from MGM Resorts for three of the four casinos Blackstone owns in Vegas, including from a two-casino partnership with MGM's real-estate business.","MGM,MGP",en,Business Insider

And then everything changed, and in the span of less than 3 weeks stocks crashed from all time highs into a bear market, in a move that has now surpassed the Global Financial Crisis in velocity, if not extent (yet).

Last month, MGM Resorts International, which owned the Mandalay Bay hotel where the shooting occurred, agreed to pay a settlement of up to $800 million to compensate victims and their families. But now, the dilemma boils down to how the judges will assign a dollar value to each person's injuries or trauma. One attorney said they'll likely create a ""sliding scale"" weighing in favor of people with the most severe injuries. Though $800 million seems like an enormous settlement, some 4,500 people joined the lawsuit against MGM and some will need far more money than others. Visit Insider's homepage for mores stories.
