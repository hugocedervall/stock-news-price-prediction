The CEOS of Bank of America, Visa, EY, BP, Johnson & Johnson, Salesforce, and several other Fortune 500 companies are joining forces with Pope Francis to promote a more inclusive form of capitalism in a new organization called the Council for Inclusive Capitalism With the Vatican. To join, business leaders must commit to measurable steps to create a more equitable and fair economic system, including adherence to the UN's sustainable development goals . As part of the commitment , the companies must take steps toward ending poverty, providing access to clear water, and reducing income inequality. This is not the first time the pope has taken a strong stance on capitalism. In the third encyclical of his papacy in October, Pope Francis rebuked free market capitalism. An encyclical is a way for religious leaders to establish a historical record of the church's teachings at the time. He's also repeatedly called for leaders to combat "" dismal "" inequality with fairer policies.",BP,en,Business Insider

2020-12-07 12:03:07-05:00,"Chevron CEO Vows Higher Returns, Lower Carbon to Revive Big Oil","(Bloomberg) -- Fresh from overtaking Exxon Mobil Corp. as North America’s biggest oil company, Chevron Corp. has a “simple promise” to investors: higher returns and lower carbon.Delivering on that promise is critical: an activist investor announced a campaign on Monday targeting Exxon for failing on both counts.“We’ve been able to remain very steady as others have had to change strategy, change dividend, change financial priorities,” Chevron Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. “For us it’s been a pretty simple promise of higher returns, lower carbon and you can count on us.”One thing investors can’t count on is for Chevron to announce any long-term targets to eliminate or severely reduce emissions, as rivals Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc have. Chevron’s carbon goals are linked to reducing methane leaks and so-called emissions intensity, which means less pollution per barrel of oil produced. That leaves the company wiggle room to increase overall emissions in the future as crude output grows.“We favor action over pledges,” Wirth said. “Long-dated pledges where we really don’t know how we’ll get to the end of the road are something that we’ve been a little bit careful about.”In a tumultuous year for oil stocks, Chevron has emerged as one of the stronger players and currently has a larger market value than Exxon, America’s biggest oil company for most of the last 100 years.",BP,en,Yahoo Finance

There’s still coffee. It’s not a filling station as we know it, but U.K. firm Gridserve’s first ‘Electric Forecourt’ launches today and with it we get a bricks-and-mortar view of how EV charging could look and feel in the future. It’s the first of 100 planned by the company in the next five years with the financial backing of Hitachi Capital behind it. All the power will come from low carbon sources — Gridserve is also rolling out solar-plus-storage projects to ensure that this power is additional. It differs from a regular petrol station in a few key ways. It takes longer to charge a car, so there needs to be space for more vehicles, with the first site in Braintree, England, having space for 36 cars to charge. In addition to the expected retail offerings, groceries, coffee, magazines, there will be wellbeing spaces, office pods for hire — charging your EV won’t be an excuse not to stay on top of those emails — and on-site EV evangelists to tap-up for knowledge or take you for a test-drive in the latest all-electric vehicles. “What Electric Forecourts are designed to do is to enable communities across the country to have the confidence to make the transition to electric vehicles, knowing that there's somewhere in their locality where they can absolutely charge as fast as their vehicle will allow,” Gridserve CEO Toddington Harper said in an interview.",BP,en,Green Technology Media

In an update to investors late last week, the company announced plans to reduce its direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions footprint by 40 per cent compared to 2019 levels by 2035, before reaching net zero emissions 15 years later. The commitment marks something of a reversal for the firm, coming less than a year after chief executive Ivan Glasenberg branded BP's 2050 net zero target as ""wishy-washy"" in an interview with The Times . He argued then that his firm preferred to be ""precise and factual"" with its carbon targets and focus on ""tangible"" nearer-term 2035 goals. But last week, the chief executive touted Glencore's new 2050 ""net zero total emissions company"" ambition, claiming it was a reflection of the miner's ""commitment to contribute to the global effort to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement"".",BP,en,BusinessGreen

China and India are responsible for half of that projected growth. But the IEA's current forecasts haven't yet accounted for the dramatic policy shifts coming from Beijing.

2020-11-13 10:02:00-05:00,Chemicals Giant Ineos Targets World’s Cheapest Green Hydrogen,"It seems everyone wants to get in at the ground floor when it comes to green hydrogen. Utilities and oil majors both have a headstart with their mixture of renewable power capacity, gas transmission assets and an existing set of end-users. But chemical manufacturers could be a third class of big green hydrogen players. AkzoNobel investigated a 20-megawatt electrolyzer as far back as 2018. U.S. industrial gases firm Air Products is planning what would be the world's largest green hydrogen complex, a 4 GW facility in Saudi Arabia. On Tuesday, chemical giant Ineos joined the green hydrogen fray, announcing its Inovyn subsidiary will launch a business unit aiming to hit the lowest production costs yet recorded for the zero-carbon fuel. It will be headed by Wouter Bleukx, who is transferring over from Inovyn’s chlor and alkali business. Chlorine is produced from salty water using giant electrolyzers that dwarf today's operational fleet of fresh water hydrogen electrolyzers. That could give Ineos and Inovyn a big advantage in making the shift to producing hydrogen via electrolysis, whether it's using electricity generated by renewable energy or other sources. “It is clearly our ambition to produce hydrogen, preferably with alkaline water electrolyzers and renewable energy,” Bleukx said in an interview with GTM. “But at this stage, we do not exclude anything, because we have to see how the technology develops over the next years.” Specifically, Inovyn is monitoring the progress of carbon capture technology for making blue hydrogen via natural gas-fuelled electrolysis.",BP,en,Green Technology Media

The plan relies heavily on capturing carbon dioxide and burying it, a technology that’s so far been prohibitively expensive.The announcement comes weeks after U.S. rival ConocoPhillips unveiled plans to curb climate-damaging pollution from its operations but didn’t address emissions generated by customers. The latter account for about 80% of the total emissions bill from a barrel of crude.American oil producers have been hesitant to adopt the sort of aggressive climate goals of European peers, in part because it would require a pivot away from the shale revolution that made U.S. oil production relevant again in global markets.Occidental’s announcement is significant because the company has one of the biggest footprints in the Permian Basin, the sprawling oil field beneath Texas and New Mexico that produces more crude than any other region on the continent.",BP,en,Yahoo Finance

As the Prime Minister seeks to build back better, now is the time to reverse that trend and invest in nature restoration. Carbon offsetting is how we do it. The long-term deforestation of the UK has meant we have one of the lowest woodland cover scores in the world. England has just 6.5 per cent woodland cover, with Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland having 9.9 per cent, 13.7 per cent and 17.2 per cent respectively. In comparison, France, Spain and Greece all have over 30 per cent woodland cover. This shift has decimated wildlife in this country.

I’m told it was pretty much a phone call. It took about three days.” Harvey, who was ousted as leader of the council in the summer, went on to borrow millions more from the PWLB, a Treasury agency, to purchase seven other commercial buildings, including £170m on an office in west London and £285m on three offices in the Thames valley. By the end of his four-year reign, the council had borrowed £1.1bn – about 100 times Spelthorne’s core spending power of £11m. “There were other local authorities that did small-scale things before us, but BP broke the mould because it was so much bigger than anything else,” he said.",BP,en,The Guardian

But equity analysts and quant strategists at the bank are expecting that to change going forward as obstacles for value outperformance begin to fade. ""European value versus growth has yet to price in the macro recovery,"" Bank of America equity analyst, Sebastian Raedler, said in the note. Raedler identifies two obstacles in the way of value outperformance. Firstly, bond yields have not risen meaningfully in response to improving economic macro data. Secondly, two of the big European value sectors have continued to underperform —energy and financials. He expects with a maturing economic recovery this will translate to rising bond yields and an improving earnings cycle for these lagging sectors. The removal of these obstacles should translate to a 10% upside for value versus growth stocks by the first quarter of next year, Raedler said. ""[Bank of America quant strategists] argue that the cyclical reasons for owning value have strengthened: (a) their Style Cycle and US & EM regional indicators point to a synchronized pick-up; (b) EPS Revision Ratio for value stocks is the strongest since 2018; and (c) 90% of Fund Managers expect a vaccine in place by H1 next year, which should help to lift bond yields,"" Raedler said.","BNR,BP",en,Business Insider

Over the past three months, dividends have slumped by 49.1 per cent, making it the lowest third quarter total since 2010, when the UK was suffering the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis. “Though by any normal standards a fall of this magnitude is terrible for investors, it is significantly better than the 57.2 per cent drop in the second quarter,” writes Link Group. Banks accounted for almost two fifths of the GBP14.5 billion cuts in the third quarter of 2020, as they remain barred from paying dividends by the Bank of England until 2021.

The Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) - which represents 12 of the world's largest oil and gas companies including BP, Shell, Exxon, Chevron, Aramco, and Petrobras - on Friday revealed it is funding research alongside Stena Bulk into mobile carbon capture on board ships out at sea. The project aims to evaluate the technical and economic challenges involved in capturing CO2 from ships cruising the oceans, and is in part an extension to OGCI member Saudi Aramco's research which it claims has successfully demonstrated carbon capture on board heavy-duty trucks on roads, it said. ""Carbon capture will play an important role in reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions, but there's no reason it needs to be limited to stationary applications,"" said Michael Traver, head of OGCI's transport workstream. ""Expanding carbon capture to long distance marine shipping could help accelerate its use, while addressing a difficult to abate sector of the transport industry.""

Pilloried by some as climate criminals, and hailed by others as critical allies in the global fight against climate change, the oil and gas sector has a defining role to play in the transition to a net zero emission economy. And, in recent months, a number of the world's biggest oil and gas companies - including, Shell, BP, and Repsol - have unveiled new net zero goals. However, huge questions remain over how one of the world's most carbon intensive industries can overhaul the core of business and move towards green energy technologies in order to deliver on those targets. Exploring these questions and more, Shell's UK country chair Sinead Lynch and Oil & Gas Technology Centre CEO Colette Cohen joined former BBC environment correspondent and now director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) think tank for a fascinating discussion during BusinessGreen 's Net Zero Festival last week.",BP,en,BusinessGreen

The $22tr investor group's latest assessment today suggests the global oil and gas sector has a long way to go to develop credible climate strategies, despite a string of high-profile net zero pledges by fossil fuel firms over the past year, including Shell , BP and Total . Assessing 59 of the largest publicly listed oil & gas and coal energy companies on their carbon performance, the TPI found that just five oil and gas companies and two coal firms are on track to align with the emissions pledges made by countries as part of the Paris Agreement.

Exxon is one of the biggest corporate emitters of greenhouse gasses globally, and the leak comes as the Texas-based company's rivals, such as BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, are planning, or have already begun , to shrink oil and gas operations to become net-zero on carbon by 2050 or before. The internal document revealed Exxon's stunning investment strategy of more than $200 billion in energy investments that would increase its emissions by about 17% through 2025.

Brightmark 's facility is the first of its kind in the US. It converts plastic waste into wax and eco-friendly fuels on a commercial scale, a process Brightmark hopes will revolutionize the plastic industry when it opens full time in 2021. ""We take a whole array of mixed waste that, until now, was not easily recyclable and reusable, and create circular economy solutions to some of our biggest environmental issues,"" founder and CEO Bob Powell told Business Insider Today. In its initial year, the plant will process close to 100,000 tons of plastic — about the weight of 600 blue whales — from waste management companies, manufacturers, and environmental groups. The full conversion process is a company secret, but it begins with breaking bales of plastic apart, then shredding the plastic into small pellets. ""We've got employees that are basically refinery operators,"" plant manager Jason Sasse added. ""So they take the plastic pellet and they convert that into our finished products."" Finished products include ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel, and companies like BP are already placing orders. ""The BPs of the world, who've been very forward-thinking and are looking to a net carbon-zero future, find our products to be really helpful,"" Powell said. ""And it's much better than pulling crude oil out of the ground to make diesel."" Critics of plastics-to-fuel technology say these types of plants can release harmful emissions of their own when plastic is heated during conversion — not to mention diesel's own contribution to air pollution.",BP,en,Business Insider

In a three-day event for investors this week, BP provided more detail on how it hopes to build 50 gigawatts of renewable power capacity while pocketing the kind of returns it's used to. As it rethinks its strategy under new CEO Bernard Looney, BP has temporaily halved its dividend. But that ""reset"" isn't meant to be forever. BP is targeting returns of 8-10 percent from its low carbon power business. That compares to an average margin for oil and gas exploration of 8.5 percent, according to NYU's Stern business school. “Can we deliver the 8-10 percent returns from renewables? The answer is very simply, yes; we actually believe we can do better. These returns could turn out to be conservative,” Looney said this week.",BP,en,Green Technology Media

The message of the outlook, according to media reports, is that oil consumption may never recover to pre-pandemic levels, and not just because of the pandemic itself but because of factors that have been at play long before the coronavirus made the jump from bats to humans. “Demand for oil falls over the next 30 years,” the company said in the report. “The scale and pace of this decline is driven by the increasing efficiency and electrification of road transportation.” In the report, BP looks at three scenarios for the future of oil demand: Business-as-usual, Rapid, and Net Zero. None of them envisage growth in oil demand over the long term. The most optimistic one—from the oil industry’s perspective—is the business-as-usual scenario , which sees demand recover from the pandemic’s effects but plateaus in the next few years before beginning to decline.",BP,en,Zero Hedge

""I don't want to bore investors with a philosophical exegesis, but you see this in the great writers both philosophical, sociological, and in literature, that they capture something that then people understand years later,"" Karp said. ""De facto, what Palantir is doing is the same thing but in tech.""

""This is the first large study to specifically investigate the association of alcohol intake and hypertension among adults with Type-2 diabetes,"" said senior study author Matthew J. Singleton from the Wake Forest University in the US. Previous studies have suggested that heavy alcohol consumption was associated with high blood pressure, however, the association of moderate alcohol consumption with high blood pressure was unclear. For the results published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, the research team examined the relationship between alcohol consumption and blood pressure in more than 10,000 adults with Type-2 diabetes (average age 63 years in 61 per cent male). Participants had Type-2 diabetes for an average of 10 years prior to enrolling in the study. In addition to 10 years with Type-2 diabetes, they were at an increased risk of cardiovascular events because they had pre-existing cardiovascular disease or had at least two additional cardiovascular disease risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking or obesity.",BP,en,Sify.com

Hammered by a collapse in oil prices, companies were forced to lay off workers, ax their prized dividends, and shrink their budgets . But the largest trend, which began shaping the industry long before the virus took root, remains intact. Energy companies are getting cleaner, as are the vehicles we drive. Oil companies built on the exploration and extraction of fossil fuels, such as Shell and BP, are now reimagining themselves as integrated energy companies . Meanwhile, young startups continue to churn out new solutions to the remaining barriers to wide-scale adoption of clean energy, like long-duration batteries. The pandemic has also given grid digitization and intelligence, another long-term trend, a boost. The virus, which made utility workers and electricity consumers work from home, has underscored the need for automation and reliable energy. Amid these transformations, the industry has been grappling with its diversity problem, following global racial-justice protests this spring and summer.",BP,en,Business Insider

The alarm was raised by research groups Amazon Watch and Stand.earth, who called oil extraction in the region “a gateway to deforestation and increased agricultural and industrial activity”. The banks that were reported to have backed the oil trade were accused of double standards, as all had made public environmental commitments, such as to the 2015 Paris climate accord, the United Nations sustainable development goals, and promises to protect forests. In the aftermath of the report, Swiss bank UBS and Netherlands-based Rabobank scrambled to state that they had stopped financing Amazonian oil, either wholly or in part, and Natixis and ING issued hasty pledges to “look into” the report’s findings.",BP,en,InstitutionAlassetManager

How would Urja Ganga and north-east pipelines survive without this?” Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board chairman DK Sarraf told ET in an interview.“Nation needs to have balanced development across regions, for socio-economic reasons.” Some industry players have opposed the proposed tariff structure on the grounds that it would force those located closer to the gas source to subsidise those in distant places.“Ultimately, as the volume grows, cross-subsidisation reduces and may even end.",BP,en,Economic Times India

But whether utilities will have the ability — or need — to compete with oil companies in the emerging hydrogen market remains an open question. To date, gigawatt-scale announcements in the hydrogen sector have been dominated by the likes of Shell, BP and Equinor, typically involving plans for meeting large sources of existing, gigawatt-scale demand in industrial clusters and in some cases their own oil refining operations. Prolonging the lifespan of multi-billion dollar gas infrastructure investments makes for another compelling incentive. But big utilities in Europe and North America, increasingly large actors on the global energy stage, are not staying on the sidelines.

Intel was a particular drag following its Thursday evening earnings report, when it admitted that its next-generation CPUs will be released six months later than expected. ""We believe the company’s delay of its 7nm roadmap will foster fears of competitive pressures persisting, if not accelerating over the next 2-3 years and thereby cap the valuation on its shares,"" wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore, who downgraded the stock from Buy to Hold. ""While INTC has successfully proven that it can generate solid revenue and earnings growth despite being behind on Moore’s Law (a trend that likely persists into 2021), we believe fears of the announced 6-month 7nm delay extending to a 10nm-esque multi-year issue that eventually does impact fundamentals will likely keep INTC's shares range-bound until the company definitively proves otherwise.""

However, it doesn’t really work that way. Let’s look at a few of the misunderstandings that lead people to believe that the world economy can move to a Green Energy future. [1] The economy isn’t really like a computer that can be switched on and off; it is more comparable to a human body that is dead, once it is switched off. A computer is something that is made by humans. There is a beginning and an end to the process of making it. The computer works because energy in the form of electrical current flows through it. We can turn the electricity off and back on again. Somehow, almost like magic, software issues are resolved, and the system works better after the reset than before.

Tourism eventually recovered and exceeded its pre-spill levels, thanks in part to BP's aggressive cleanup program and national advertising scheme. Almost exactly a decade later, the area's hotels and condos face another existential threat — from the coronavirus crisis and they are already showing signs of recovery even as the number of cases continues to skyrocket. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . In April 2010, an explosion at BP's Deepwater Horizon oil rig pumped crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico for five months, covering Lousiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida beaches with tar, and effectively canceling tourism for much of the summer. In June, July, and August, the Gulf coast's beach towns typically bring in 60% of their revenue, per The Pensacola News Journal . But between June and September 2010, the 90 mile stretch of oceanfront metro areas between Pensacola and Panama City, Florida lost $150 million in tourism each month .",BP,en,Business Insider

Digital technologies are entering every aspect of our life at a steady pace. However, according to predictions from Huawei in collaboration with Oxford Economics, the digital economy is expected to comprise 24.3% of the world’s gross domestic product by 2025, giving it an astronomical valuation of around $23 trillion. Among the few innovative technologies leading this revolution is blockchain. Even though blockchain came to be the core technology for Bitcoin ( BTC ), today it stands independent, impacting several industries, from gaming companies and enterprises to the manufacturing sector. The fact that data, once it is in the database, cannot be changed or deleted without informing all involved parties takes possible uses of this technology to a new level.

In the post-COVID world, the increasing use of methanol across various end-use segments including alternative fuels and acetic acid is now expected to be driving the market growth.

Now Exxon is the only major firm still backing the biofuel, which several top algae scientists say is destined to flop. (XOM)","In the late 2000s, algae biofuel looked like the fuel of the future. It was promoted by some of the world's largest oil companies, such as Shell, BP, and Exxon. But in the years since, these companies have been unable to make the economics of algae competitive with those of crude oil. Today, Exxon Mobil is the only major oil firm still backing algae biofuels in a big way. It's invested more than $300 million in biofuels research in the past decade. Some critics call Exxon's project greenwashing, pointing out that it's spending just a sliver of its budget on biofuels. Others say these fuels are becoming irrelevant in an increasingly electric world. Exxon and its partner, the unicorn startup Synthetic Genomics Inc., tell a different story. SGI says new genetic technologies and government incentives to curb carbon emissions could make algae biofuel economical.

The release of the study came on the same day as UK hydrogen aircraft start-up ZeroAvia successfully conducted the first ever electric-powered flight yesterday of a commercial-scale aircraft carried out in the UK. It argued that with supportive investment, regulation, and R&D signals, planes running on forms of zero carbon hydrogen power could be carrying passengers on regional commercial routes within the next 10 to 15 years, at ticket prices only a fraction higher than for today's fossil fuelled planes. Planes fuelled by direct hydrogen combustion have the potential to reduce in-flight greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 75 per cent compared to conventional planes, the study estimates, while hydrogen fuel cell technology - which uses H2 to produce electricity - could reduce emissions by as much as 75 to 90 per cent.",BP,en,BusinessGreen

New research from Imperial College Business School shows that despite the advantages, institutional investors are failing to reap the rewards of renewables. “Our results show that renewable power is outperforming financially, but has still not attracted sizeable support from listed equity investors,” says Dr Charles Donovan, executive director of the Centre for Climate Finance and Investment at Imperial College Business School.

Also, the company is raising Rs 53,125 crore through a rights issue.""We analysed RIL's balance sheet following the recent deal-making.

Moller-Maersk and Scandinavian airline SAS. The project would initially use a 10-megawatt electrolyzer to generate green hydrogen for fleet buses and trucks. Power would be drawn from the Danish island of Bornholm, around which Ørsted hopes to develop a 5-gigawatt offshore wind cluster. The first stage of the sustainable fuels project is now jumping through initial regulatory hoops and looking for public funding to back a feasibility study. A final investment decision on phase one could be made next year. The second phase, targeting completion in 2027, jumps the scale of the electrolyzers up to 250 megawatts.

It is equally true, though, that what all these reports overlook is that the shale oil (and gas) sector is too important from a geopolitical and economic perspective to the world standing of the U.S. for it to be allowed to fail, and all other considerations are secondary. In reality, the U.S. shale sector is set to emerge stronger, and earlier, than the vast majority of people think. Ever since the 1973 Oil Crisis - when Saudi Arabia pressured OPEC members plus Egypt, Syria, and Tunisia to embargo oil exports to the U.S. (and the U.K., Japan, Canada, and the Netherlands) in response to the U.S.’s supplying of arms to Israel in the Yom Kippur War – the U.S. had been itching for a way to end its energy dependence on other countries.",BP,en,Zero Hedge

The oil major announced on Friday that a feasibility study was underway for a huge green hydrogen operation. This would then be converted into ""green ammonia"" and exported internationally. A pilot phase would produce 20 kilotons annually (ktpa) with the full-scale commercial operation producing 1,000ktpa of green ammonia.

BP says it will invest A$2.7 million ($1.75 million) into the study, with the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) chipping in another A$1.7 million . Ammonia is cheaper to store than hydrogen and, given its widespread use in fertilizers, it already has a large supply chain in place. “We believe that green hydrogen will play an increasingly important role, not only as a new, clean energy vector, but also in enabling the further growth of renewable power,” Dev Sanyal, executive VP of BP’s gas and low carbon business, said in a statement. “This aligns with BP’s ambition to support the world’s decarbonization agenda.” In February BP announced a net zero by 2050 ambition in February, and said it would release more details in September.",BP,en,Green Technology

The Bay Area company finished development of its Boost Charger, which delivers fast charging (up to 120 kilowatt output) while minimizing stress on the local power grid with the help of a built-in 160 kilowatt-hour battery. That storage capacity allows fast charging while lowering the instantaneous pull from the grid to resemble a Level 2 charger (roughly 10 kilowatts), which in turn reduces costly grid upgrades required to install the system in the first place. These permitting and infrastructure upgrade savings can drive total system installation costs 25 to 40 percent lower than an equivalent fast charger, despite the extra cost of the batteries, CEO Arcady Sosinov said. ""Consumers want faster and faster charging, and its harder and harder to keep up with it from the infrastructure perspective,"" he said.

With major global economies on lockdown in a bid to stem the spread of the coronavirus, demand for oil from the transport and energy sectors has taken a dramatic downturn, pushing down prices that were already falling thanks to moves by OPEC to maintain production even as demand slowed. As a result, oil prices have plummeted and yesterday US future contracts went negative for the first time in history as global storage capacity for oil continued to fill up.

Major oil companies are scrambling to cut costs to respond. Current dividend payouts from seven majors are not sustainable, a top analyst at IHS Markit told Business Insider. ""The risk is increasing that dividends will be cut if prices stay below $40,"" he said. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . From ExxonMobil to Shell, the world's supermajors are no strangers to an oil price collapse. They've dealt with them many times before and survived. And during the last downturn, as recent as 2016, all but one major company — the Italian giant, Eni — was able to preserve their prized dividend payouts. But this oil price collapse is different. It wasn't just ignited by a price war , as in years past, but by an epic cratering of demand . That means that both oil production and downstream activity like refining are taking a hit. What's more, oil majors are far more leveraged this time around, says Lysle Brinker, an executive director of equity research and analysis at the research firm IHS Markit.",BP,en,Business Insider
2020-04-09 16:16:00-05:00,Lightsource Project to Double Large-Scale Solar in Arkansas,"Lightsource BP, the U.K.-based solar developer backed by BP, announced the approval of a 132-megawatt solar project in Arkansas that would nearly double the state’s utility-scale capacity. Municipal utility Conway Corporation will use power from the project, called Happy Solar, which is slated for commercial operation in 2022. The project — finalized from the living room and home offices of executives due to the coronavirus pandemic — shows that deals are still getting done in the U.S. solar market, even as the economy takes a significant downturn. For Lightsource, the project suggests a growing interest in engaging with smaller, more local utilities. Those types of deals often involve more collaboration, Kevin Smith, Lightsource's CEO for the Americas, told GTM. “The bigger utilities have done dozens and dozens of renewable energy contracts, so it’s a little bit more business as usual. They have their procedures and policies and contract structures,” he said. “In reality, it’s a little bit more fun working with some of the co-ops and municipals that are new to the renewable energy sector.” Lightsource is looking toward new geographies — everywhere east of Colorado — and new power off-takers as solar prices drop.",BP,en,Green Technology

Oil companies have pulled back 2020 spending plans by an average of 22% as countries limit air travel, order businesses closed and tell residents to stay home to combat the pandemic that has killed more than 76,000 worldwide.

Commentators from the UN Secretary General down, taking in almost the full breadth of the political spectrum, have noted how Covid-19 has exposed precisely the same long tail risks, institutional brittleness, structural absence of redundancy, socio-economic injustices, geopolitical tensions, cavalier insouciance towards environmental risks and limits, amoral misinformation campaigns and crazed conspiracy theories, and ideological hubris that have characterised the stuttering response to the climate crisis for over a decade. As the former Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger noted: ""the main lesson we have to learn is this: Covid-19 is a dress rehearsal for climate change…"" It is a point that was echoed late last week by BP CEO Bernard Looney, who in a quietly remarkable blog post stressed that the pandemic would not compromise the company's newly announced pledge to deliver net zero emissions.",BP,en,BusinessGreen

But industrial emissions are too important to overlook. Industry — think makers of iron, concrete and chemicals — accounts for one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions. And the problem has been getting worse: Direct industrial emissions rose by 65 percent from 1990 to 2014. Any hope of meeting Paris Agreement targets rests on decarbonizing the industrial sector over the next half-century. The task is made more difficult by the sector’s lack of inherent appeal. “You don’t hear as much about the specific technologies and strategies to decarbonize industry as you do some of the sectors,” Jeffrey Rissman, director of the industry program at think tank Energy Innovation, told Greentech Media. “Industry can be a little more obscure because it's behind the scenes; it's manufacturing processes, what happens inside the factory.” Rissman led an effort to tap the collective wisdom of more than two dozen researchers from eight countries to produce a roadmap for decarbonizing global industry over the next 30 to 50 years.",BP,en,Green Technology

This is a crucial question. The climate crisis may be a longer term threat, but as with coronavirus, it could prove catastrophic for societies and economies around the world. Green businesses and investors with long memories will be painfully aware of how the fallout from the 2008 financial crash disrupted low carbon infrastructure projects and clean tech programmes for years to come. The fear now is that even as climate impacts escalate, governments and businesses will respond to the pandemic by rowing back on their essential decarbonisation plans.

The cross-party Divest Parliament initiative today responded to the recently released annual report from the Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund (PCPF) , which revealed that the fund has significant increased its interest in low carbon assets while reducing its exposure to some high carbon businesses.

However, while the fund's holdings in carbon intensive companies have fallen it still retains an £8m stake in Royal Dutch Shell and £4.4m in BP PLC.",BP,en,BusinessGreen

A dispute between Russia and Saudi Arabia has sent a flood of cheap oil and gas into global markets just as the COVID-19 pandemic is stifling demand. This market dislocation comes at a time when European oil majors including Shell , Total , Repsol and BP are embarking seriously down a path toward emission reductions and the diversification of their businesses into renewables, e-mobility and other energy services. Oil companies have been notoriously slow in pivoting their businesses toward cleaner energy sources. Will the current market storm change that? Might it even accelerate the transition? “The argument that has often been put forward is that they can't invest in renewables, because renewable projects offer much lower returns than oil and gas projects.

'Now there is no debate' 2019 was a breakout year for bifacial solar technology, with global installations doubling compared to 2018, according to data from Wood Mackenzie.

Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced the government would launch a review before the end of June aimed at tightening conditions for the export of coal-fired power plants. Japan remains a major financier and exporter of coal power infrastructure to emerging economies across South East Asia, prompting criticism from campaigners and some governments. Reuters quoted Koizumi as saying that global criticism of Japan's ""addiction to coal"" was cutting through and had helped make the case for the review. ""The international community sees Japan as not moving an inch on this, so whether we take action or not will mean a lot,"" he said.

The top tier of solar asset owners worldwide could change dramatically over the next 12 months due to the rapid ascent of a number of oil and gas companies, said Tom Heggarty, principal analyst in the energy transition practice at Wood Mackenzie. France's Total, which controls SunPower and already had around 3 gigawatts of renewable generation assets before buying into a 2.1-gigawatt PV portfolio this month, will almost certainly be one of solar energy’s biggest asset holders. BP, Galp and Shell could also rank among the dozen or so leading solar generators, Heggarty said. The oil and gas sector’s assault on the solar market is made easier by the fact that PV asset ownership is highly fragmented. The top 10 asset holders globally control around 10 percent of the 600 gigawatts or so of capacity installed worldwide. Outside China, there are only a couple of dozen companies in the world with more than a gigawatt of solar capacity under ownership.",BP,en,Green Technology

LNG rates have fallen below $3 per mmBtu from above $10 just six years ago. The coronavirus outbreak in China has amplified the fall, cutting spot rates by a third in a month.In November, when RIL-BP offered 5 million metric standard cubic meters a day (mmscmd) of gas proposed to be produced from its KG Basin field, the prices quoted in the auction were very close to the floor rate fixed by producers.

The idea is to focus on deepening its expertise in the industries to which it wants to sell — like healthcare, Dr. Lee's particular patch.

Microsoft's industry focus is part of Nadella's vision of ""tech intensity,"" a sales pitch to encourage all kinds of companies to adopts its products. Click here to read more BI Prime stories. Microsoft executive Peter Lee has worked under two Microsoft CEOs in his near-decade at the company – and the biggest difference between current chief Satya Nadella and his predecessor Steve Ballmer is the way he thinks about Microsoft as a company.

2019-12-30 09:08:40-05:00,Commentary: Policies Hurt Mexico's Oil Production,"The partnership of government policy and ideology has a long history in Mexico, and with the election in 2018 of socialist President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, commonly known as AMLO, the country is now rethinking its lauded energy reforms. Before the reforms, annual crude output at the state-owned oil company, Petróleos Mexicanos, which is usually shortened to Pemex, had been waning for the past decade. In response, then-President Calderón called for the reforms in 2013 and subsequent President Enrique Peña Nieto enacted them the next year, ending the government's 75-year oil production monopoly and opening the Mexican energy sector to private investment. (Photo credit: Jim Allen/FreightWaves) Beyond the initial capital infusion, foreign firms offer to share cutting-edge techniques for discovery, drilling and ecological sustainability. This was sorely lacking at Pemex at the time the reforms were initially introduced. And to add insult to injury, British Petroleum and Petrobras, the state-owned oil company of Brazil, had just discovered a record-breaking oil reserve in the Gulf of Mexico in 2009 that could top off at four to six billion barrels.",BP,en,Benzinga Feeds

The impairment is a sign that the waters are getting pretty rough for the oil and gas industry , due to a combination of supply surpluses, low prices, the struggling and unproven business case for large-scale shale drilling, and the looming threat of peak demand. The write down comes as Chevron lowered its long-term forecast for oil and gas prices, which directly impacted the value of its assets. “We have to make the tough choices to high-grade our portfolio and invest in the highest-return projects in the world we see ahead of us, and that’s a different world than the one that lies behind us,” Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal . The WSJ says the admission that billions of dollars’ worth of assets are worth a lot less than previously thought could force others to “publicly reassess the value of their holdings in the face of a global supply glut and growing investor concerns about the long-term future of fossil fuels.” The write down is also an indictment of shale gas drilling in Appalachia.",BP,en,Zero Hedge

Chemical recycling is a process that has been around for more than six decades but was almost unheard of until the so-called “plastic pollution crisis” came into the spotlight. Now, resin producers are looking at anything and everything in an attempt to find solutions for ridding the planet of plastic waste. An article in the Dec. 9 edition of the Wall Street Journal , “Plastics Recycling Gets Fresh Tech Push,” authored by Saabira Chaudhuri, discusses the resurgence of chemical recycling, noting that “companies are turning to [chemical recycling] now, partly because of the need to find more recycled material to meet or forestall regulations aiming to cut emissions and waste.” Chemical recycling ran into the same problem that mechanical recycling encounters: The cost made recycled material more expensive than virgin resin, so what’s the point?

The announcement by the UK's Serious Fraud Office adds to separate corruption probes that Glencore is facing in the U.S. and Brazil, which have sent the company's stock sliding in recent years. Without providing much detail, the SFO said it’s looking into suspicions of bribery by the company, its employees, agents and associated persons. Glencore said it will cooperate with the probe, but didn’t provide any further details. “This is an obvious negative for the Glencore investment case,” RBC analyst Tyler Broda wrote in a research note. “We believe this clearly will hamper sentiment in what remains a complex investment case for investors.""

It recently signed a preliminary agreement with ONGC to undertake joint technical studies, cooperate in difficult fields and jointly bid for exploration acreages. It accessed the government’s National Data Repository to study large amount of geological data to evaluate the possibility of an exploration bet, according to officials.ExxonMobil didn’t comment on its regulatory demands but said it was “keen to be a long-term partner in India’s energy journey”.“India has already taken a host of encouraging steps forward by facilitating access to seismic data, which is critical to enhancing the potential of success,” ExxonMobil said in an emailed response to ET’s query. “At the same time, developing the right contractual terms that secure stability and provide investor protection will go a long way in ensuring that projects are viable and help India compete for and win global capital.”The company has been engaged with the government on several regulatory aspects, seeking clarifications on some, and urging key changes on others, such as the freedom to the explorer to invoke international arbitration in case of a dispute with the government, according to officials.Current oilfield contracts provide for arbitration in India, which is not confidence-inspiring for some foreign companies, which think international arbitration mechanism is likely to be fairer to them.",BP,en,The Economic Times India

2019-11-28 07:00:30-05:00,The Reality Behind Green Hydrogen’s Soaring Hype,"Green hydrogen produced using renewable energy is increasingly seen as a key asset for grid and transport decarbonization. Interest in the technology is surging. Shell believes the hydrogen sector deserves the same levels of support that went to solar energy over the years. But at least in the medium term, the decarbonization potential of hydrogen is limited. In some areas, it's “just not economical, and it won’t be,"" said Wood Mackenzie senior analyst Ben Gallagher. Green hydrogen remains inefficient and expensive today, with an end-to-end efficiency of only around 30 percent, said Gallagher. As a result, it's hard to see it being used for electricity generation in markets such as the U.S., where natural gas prices are expected to remain low for the foreseeable future. Similar challenges could hamper attempts to make hydrogen a viable alternative to electrification in the automotive sector. “On the mobility side, you not only have the electrolyzer, you have a large distribution network that you need to build out,” said Gallagher. “Compared to either EVs or gasoline, I don’t understand how it’s going to be cost-competitive in any way, anytime soon.” Not much ""green"" today Gallagher’s views echo the findings of a major report on green hydrogen published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) in September, which warned that the fuel “should not be considered a panacea.” “A hydrogen-based energy transition will not happen overnight,” Irena’s report states. “Hydrogen will likely trail other strategies such as electrification of end-use sectors, and its use will target specific applications.",BP,en,Green Technology

EOS Block Producer “EOS New York” has published data purportedly showing that six registered producers on the network are managed by a single entity.

This is unacceptable. We have requested the signatures of the top 50 registered producers so that all token-holders may know who does and who does not condone such impropriety.” Block Producers and “delegated proof-of-stake” In the EOS ecosystem, Block Producers (BPs) are analogous to miners on the Proof-of-Work -based Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain or staking nodes on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol. The difference with EOS lies in the network’s consensus mechanism, “delegated proof-of-stake,” whereby — in keeping with the governance terms set by the EOS’ constitution — network participants are able to stake their tokens to vote for BPs as “elected delegates.” Rather than merely staking EOS tokens as in a PoS system, Block Producers stake their investment in the network in the form of infrastructure, community support and development.",BP,en,Cointelegraph

Despite Saudi Arabia’s big plans for solar and Aramco’s own impressive spend on renewables, the state-owned petrochemical behemoth largely views clean energy as a means to improve the efficiency of extraction, said Bloomberg New Energy Finance oil specialist David Doherty. That’s not likely to change as Aramco seeks to attract outside investment, Doherty told GTM. While other major oil and gas firms have started diversifying into clean energy fields ranging from offshore wind to electric vehicle charging, Aramco has “pretty much focused on technologies that can push demand for their products,” he said. This includes three-dimensional printing, which could boost the market for petrochemical-based composites, as well as carbon capture and storage.

ONGC is spending more than $5 billion to bring these fields to production.It has set a reserve price of $5.61 per million metric British thermal unit (mmBtu) and the minimum bid quantity at 0.05 MMSCMD. Bidders will have to quote the number of days they would need to offtake gas after being awarded—with preference for the bidder with fewer days in case of a price tie. Bidders will make a single bid electronically.Other bidders will be asked to match the highest quoted price. Reliance Industries and partner BP too are set to e-auction 5 MMSCMD of gas from its KG basin fields on November 15. They plan to supply gas from April. These new domestic gas supplies will likely replace some of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports that have expanded 7.9% in the first half of 2019-20 and make up half of country’s gas consumption.But a recent collapse in the global LNG market has made it tougher for ONGC and RIL-BP to extract high prices.",BP,en,The Economic Times India

Weaker oil prices cut the company's first half net profit by 12% to $46.9 billion this year, but the figures still overshadowed Apple Inc , the world's most profitable listed company, which made $31.5 billion.Last year, Aramco made an annual net profit of $111 billion, over a third bigger than the combined net income of the five super majors Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, BP, Chevron and Total.To diversify its oil business, Aramco is expanding in refining and petrochemicals with the aim of almost tripling its chemicals production to 34 million tonnes per year by 2030 and raising its global refining capacity to 8-10 million barrels per day (bpd) from more than 5 million bpd.Below are some key facts about Aramco's history, reserves and operations.HISTORYExplorers from the Rockefeller family's Standard Oil Company struck oil in Saudi Arabia in 1938.",BP,en,The Economic Times India

BPCL has a market capitalisation of Rs 1.05 lakh crore and its acquisition together with the mandatory open offer to minority shareholders would cost upwards of Rs 82,000 crore.On a visit here to attend an industry conference, Total Chairman and CEO Patrick Pouyanne said the company was interested in investing in downstream petrochemicals and retailing market in India but was ""not interested in Indian refineries"".The French giant announced buying 37.4 per cent stake in Adani Gas - which retails CNG to automobiles and piped cooking gas to households besides developing import terminals and a national chain of petrol stations.Reliance, which operates the world's biggest refinery complex at single site, too is unlikely to bid as it is already in talks to sell out a fifth of its oil-to-chemicals business to Saudi Aramco to cut down high debt it had taken for its foray in telecom business, sources said.It is unclear if Saudi Aramco, which is keen to enter the world's fastest growing energy market, will bid alone or with some other partner such as Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (Adnoc).BP chief executive Bob Dudley said it was ""early days"" for the privatisation of BPCL. ""We need to see what is on offer,"" he said.On September 30, a group of secretaries on disinvestment gave its approval for to sell government's entire 53.29 per cent stake in BPCL, which is likely to be completed by March 31, next year.BPCL is the country's the second-largest state-owned refining and marketing firm, accounting for 15 per cent of total installed refining capacity.",BP,en,The Economic Times India

Such spending was earlier voluntary. Making shortfalls a criminal offence will shift the emphasis from good outcomes to mere spending, with perverse results.Vijay Kelkar says if shortfalls in spending are made criminal offences for everybody, over half our ministers and officials will be jailed for not meeting budgeted spending targets approved by Parliament.Creating wealth through high quality accountability to customers, shareholders, staff and suppliers is the highest form of social responsibility.

Also, the stock is at Rs 1200, do you believe that there is room for further upmove?Ajay Bagga: From an analysis perspective, without giving a buy or sell recommendation on the stock, what I would say is that Reliance apart from its traditional refinery petchem business has got two huge levers now going for it -- the telecom and the consumption.

From his message to shareholders, it doesn’t look like India’s richest tycoon is worried. But his actions may reveal more than his words.At Monday’s annual general meeting, the chairman of Reliance Industries Ltd. was brimming with optimism. Not only did he endorse Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of bumping up annual GDP by 80% in five years to $5 trillion, he even forecast a $10 trillion Indian economy by 2030. It’s not only possible but “inevitable,” he said.Something doesn’t add up. If the outlook is so rosy, why is Ambani hitting the brakes on a seven-year, $100 billion investment spree across refining, petrochemicals, telecom and retail? While a breather after such frenzied activity may be understandable, why does he want Reliance to be a zero-net-debt company in 18 months?

New Delhi is “number one priority” for Riyadh,” he said.On February 20, Lutyen’s Delhi had even been buzzing with speculation that a deal announcement was due.

The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and then the U.S. Supreme Court refused to undo the settlement. The appeals court even refused in 2014 to revisit the trial court’s interpretation of the settlement, which, according to BP, made it all too easy for people to collect undeserved claims.",BP,en,Reuters
2019-03-21 07:22:00-05:00,It's been nearly 30 years since the Exxon Valdez oil spill. But that crisis pales in comparison to these recent ocean disasters.,"Thirty years ago, the Exxon Valdez oil tanker ran aground on a reef in in Alaska’s Prince William Sound and dumped 11 million gallons of oil into the ocean. The spill affected almost the entire Alaskan coastline, killing birds, sea otters, harbor seals, orcas and other wildlife. Since Exxon Valdez, more than 9,500 tanker spills have occurred worldwide. Some 20 years later, the Deep Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico dumped 19 times more oil into the ocean than Exxon Valdez did. Humans also contaminate global waters by dumping industrial waste water and polluting the ocean with plastic . Often, recovery from the effects of these man-made disasters takes decades. In the case of Exxon Valdez, some oil still lingers in the Gulf of Alaska. At 12:04 am on March 24, 1989, the Exxon Valdez oil tanker struck the Bligh Reef, less than 2 miles off the coast of Alaska. In the remote waters of the Gulf of Alaska, the tanker hemorrhaged some 11 million gallons of oil into the ocean. An ill-timed storm followed, spreading the oil along Alaska's coastline.",BP,en,Business Insider

Wertheim, 79, is a self-made billionaire worth $2.3 billion, according to Forbes ' The World's Billionaires list. His fortune comes from numerous inventions and buy-and-hold investing. Wertheim could very well be the most significant individual investor many Americans have never heard of, and he recently sat down with Forbes to prove it. Madeline Berg, a reporter at Forbes following the money, flipped through Wertheim's brokerage statements which showed hundreds of millions of dollars in tech stocks like Apple and Microsoft, purchased long ago at their IPOs. There are dozens of other blue-chip stocks in the portfolio, ranging from GE, Google, BP, and Bank of America. Here is Wertheim's interesting path into becoming a billionaire. In the early 1960s, he attended the Southern College of Optometry and after graduation started a small practice in South Florida. At nights, Wertheim spent his time tinkering on inventions, and in 1969, he invented an eyeglass tint for plastic lenses that filtered dangerous UV rays, helping to prevent cataracts.",BP,en,Zero Hedge

While traders were delighted to buy the rumor and then buy the news of the China March 1 tariff extension, expecting an imminent trade deal between the US and China, sentiment soured on Tuesday as world shares took a breather on Tuesday after hitting a five-month high, with global markets dropping as the rush of optimism over U.S.-China trade talks turned to pessimism, leading to a sea of red in world markets with even the Chinese stock bubble pausing overnight, while in FX the pound soared, hitting the highest against the Euro since 2017, as the May government gave signs it was willing to delay Brexit. Europe's Stoxx 600 Index slumped and S&P 500 Index futures drpoped after President Trump raised the possibility of signing a new trade deal with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, but cautioned an agreement “ might not happen at all.” “It looks like they will be coming back quickly again,” Trump told reporters Monday , referring to the possibility of Chinese negotiators returning after a week of talks on trade. “We are going to have a signing summit, which is even better,” he said, adding: “We are getting very very close.” However, the president promptly tempered his enthusiasm, noting that a deal “ might not happen at all.” As Bloomberg notes, with Trump set to hold another summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un this week, a diplomatic effort in which China will play a critical role, the risk of a setback remains significant.",BP,en,Zero Hedge

Although far from discovering some new source of alpha, according to Goldman's analysis of the latest batch of 13F filings, the recent strong hedge fund returns have benefited from the outperformance of the most popular long positions as well as the decision to increase net length ahead of the equity market bottom in December 2018. Furthermore, the relative performance of Goldman's Hedge Fund VIP basket and hedge fund net long exposure each bottomed in the days before the S&P 500 reached its low on December 24. So far in 2019, the VIP basket, which tracks the most popular long positions, has returned +14%, outperforming both the S&P 500 (+11%) and Goldman's basket of the largest short positions (GSTHVISP, +7%), which is to be expected in light of the massive short squeeze that has taken place in the past 9 weeks.",BP,en,Zero Hedge
