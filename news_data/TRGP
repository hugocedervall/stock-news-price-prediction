2020-07-29 18:05:11-05:00,Here Is The Strategy Of The Best Performing Hedge Fund Of 2020,"Here Is The Strategy Of The Best Performing Hedge Fund Of 2020 Tyler Durden Wed, 07/29/2020 - 19:05 Sure, there are probably a handful of hedge funds who have generated even higher returns, but for the purpose of this post we are going off the latest HSBC hedge fund weekly report, according to which Boaz Weinstein's Saba Capital is the best performing hedge fund of 2020 with a staggering 90% YTD return. But how is the former Deutsche Bank prop trader making a killing when most of his hedge fund peers are struggling to post a positive return for 2020, let alone beat the S&P500? Conveniently, we have the answer courtesy of a Bloomberg profile digging deep into Weinstein's current living conditions, which just incidentally also happens to discuss his latest - and perhaps greatest - trading strategy. Bloomberg starts off by chronicling Weinstein's current living conditions which in this time of pervasive coronavirus lockdowns, are whimsical, even by a hedge fund manager's standards: Weinstein has repaired to his gated estate in Sagaponack, replete with tennis court, pool and a Vegas-style card room.",TRGP,en,Zero Hedge

Behind the scenes, however, the Treasury’s responsibilities have fallen largely to the 42-year-old deputy secretary, Justin Muzinich. A major beneficiary of that bailout so far: Muzinich & Co., the asset manager founded by his father where Justin served as president before joining the administration. He reported owning a stake worth at least $60 million when he entered government in 2017. Today, Muzinich retains financial ties to the firm through an opaque transaction in which he transferred his shares in the privately held company to his father. Ethics experts say the arrangement is troubling because his father received the shares for no money up front, and it appears possible that Muzinich can simply get his stake back after leaving government.",TRGP,en,Zero Hedge
