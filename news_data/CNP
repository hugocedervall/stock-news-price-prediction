2020-11-10 16:00:00-05:00,Construction of Houbolt Road bridge in Joliet will wait until spring,"Construction of the future Houbolt Road bridge is being pushed off to spring with another round of legal agreements still to be finalized. The future toll bridge over the Des Plaines River has faced a number of delays because of a BNSF Railway lawsuit regarding the bridge's crossing over a railroad line, but may be clearing the last legal hurdles. ""I'm very confident we're going forward,"" CenterPoint Properties CEO Michael Murphy said Monday. A joint venture group formed by CenterPoint Properties will build and operate the bridge, which is intended to provide trucks with a direct route between the CenterPoint Intermodal Center and Interstate 80. The bridge is expected to relieve semitrailer congestion on other roads. Murphy said it's still possible some clearing work can be done before spring. ""But we've got steel to order and some materials to order,"" he said. ""We're probably looking at full-out construction March 15 or April 15."" The last major hurdle appeared to be cleared in July with a lease agreement spelling out CenterPoint's financial responsibilities for the bridge, which will be owned by the city of Joliet.",CNP,en,The Joliet Herald News
