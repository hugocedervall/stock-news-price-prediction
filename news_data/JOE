Debra Robbins, director of marketing and community relations for Silver Cross Hospital in New Lenox, said the hospital is seeing an increasing number of covid-positive patients, many of whom come through the hospital’s emergency department. “As you can imagine, in the emergency department, it takes a little longer to care for suspected covid patients because staff must don and doff personal protective equipment, and test results can take three to four hours,” Robbins said in an email. Currently, the hospital has 85 positive patients and one patient waiting for test results. “Because we’re always prepared, we have capacity and we’ve been able to meet the needs of our patients in the midst of this current increase in cases,” Robbins wrote. Robbins stressed the need for people in the community to wear facemasks, social distance and practice frequent handwashing. “We worry about people not masking in the community and exposing health care workers,” Robbins wrote. “If a health care worker is exposed, they’re unable to work.""
