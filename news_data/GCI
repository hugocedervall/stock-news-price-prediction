2019-03-29 04:00:12-05:00,Joanne Lipman on Speaking Up for Women in the Workplace,"(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- Women, men, and work: It’s complicated. Joanne Lipman, the former editor-in-chief of USA Today and chief content officer of Gannett Co., has spent her career navigating office gender issues. Her how-to guide, That’s What She Said: What Men and Women Need to Know About Working Together, out in paperback, has advice on dealing with the complexities. She spoke with Bloomberg Businessweek about the gender gap. Your book convincingly argues that both men and women discriminate against working women. Why does that happen? What we’re talking about is unconscious bias. Everyone—women, men, black, white—has biases that are buried so deeply inside that they don’t realize they exist. These biases come out in subtle but important ways. For example, women are interrupted three times as often as men, and when women do it, they tend to interrupt women. What would you say to executives whose solution to #MeToo is to avoid one-on-ones with women? I have zero patience for it.",GCI,en,Bloomberg
