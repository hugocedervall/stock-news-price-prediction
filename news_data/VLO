Morgan Stanley's equity strategy team think it's a firm ""yes."" Newly released economic data including expanding global purchasing-manager indexes, rising retail sales in the US and Europe, increasing global trade volume, and decreasing inventory levels are all pointing to an ongoing economic rebound, Morgan Stanley said in a Friday research note. However, it is the strength of the US consumer that cements the equity strategy team's view on the ""intact"" recovery, wrote strategist Adam Virgadamo, noting that ""US household personal income already reached 2% above pre-COVID levels in August."" Further driving the recovery will be the efficacy data from three coronavirus vaccine candidates in November. Under ""operation warp speed,"" the US government has purchased hundreds of millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses from Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Sanofi/GSK, and Novavax. ""Companies have been ramping production capacity such that hundreds of millions of doses could be available in the US within this time frame (each vaccination requires 2 doses to be effective),"" said Virgadamo.",VLO,en,Business Insider

We’re talking about a quarter where the price of U.S. crude oil averaged $28 a barrel, the lowest for any three-month period in nearly two decades. In one strange confluence of events, crude oil even traded negative for a brief period. This is something never seen before. Crude rebounded to back near $40 a barrel by the end of Q2 and remains right around there as of mid-July, still not enough to rescue the sector from what are likely to be horrific earnings results. As of last week, research firm FactSet pegged the average Q2 earnings per share loss for S&P 500 Energy firms at 149.9% vs. a year ago. Keep in mind that Energy wasn’t exactly tearing up the pea patch even in 2019, before COVID-19 came along.

2019-02-05 06:51:21-05:00,Flotilla Of Venezuelan Oil Tankers Stranded In Gulf Of Mexico,"On Monday evening, the embattled regime of Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro suffered its latest blow when 11 of the 14 members of the ""Lima Group"" - an organization created with the singular aim to bring about a ""peaceful end"" to the crisis in Latin America's socialist paradise - backed opposition leader Juan Guaido as the legitimate ruler of Venezuela. In a declaration issued by the group, the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Paraguay and Peru ""reiterate their recognition and support for Juan Guaidó"" and called on the international community ""to take measures to prevent the Maduro regime from conducting financial and trade transactions abroad, from having access to Venezuela's international assets and from doing business in oil, gold and other assets,"" according to the BBC . And in the latest sign that military conflict remains a possibility (after all, both President Trump and National Security Advisor John Bolton have insisted that the door to a military intervention is still open), when asked about whether a civil war is inevitable, Maduro replied that ""no one could answer that question with certainty."" While Guaido, who is struggling to convince the Venezuelan military to abandon Maduro and back his upstart parallel government, definitively ruled out a war as an option.",VLO,en,Zero Hedge
