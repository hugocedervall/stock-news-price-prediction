Among the insurance stocks hit hard last week were Heritage Insurance Holdings Inc (NYSE: HRTG ), down 8.3% last week, and Federated National Holding Co . (NASDAQ: FNHC ), HCI Group Inc (NYSE: HCI ) and United Insurance Holdings Corp . (NASDAQ: UIHC ) — all down more than 5%. “We'd expect a rebound to these names if Dorian tracks as currently predicted,” Phillips said. But the east coast isn’t fully out of danger, particularly areas farther north, including coastal Georgia, the Carolinas and even Virginia. Total damage, however, was looking lower than the $15 billion to $40 billion range projected last week. #Dorian remains a Category …",HRTG,en,Benzinga
