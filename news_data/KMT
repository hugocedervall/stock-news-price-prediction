Most manufacturing companies still run most of their applications on-premises, but Gartner predicts that by the end of 2026, at least 80% of manufacturers worldwide will have adopted cloud applications built specifically for their industry. AWS, Microsoft, and Google Cloud have already devoted vast resources to winning over manufacturing customers, moving them over to the cloud, and building cloud products specially tailored for that industry. ""All of the cloud providers are investing in this space,"" Forrester principal analyst Paul Miller told Business Insider. As Google Cloud works to catch up to AWS and Microsoft in the cloud, it hired a former Accenture director — Suchitra Bose — as the new director of process manufacturing. Bose, who previously led Accenture's digital manufacturing and operations practice, will develop Google Cloud's manufacturing industry strategy , focusing on sales, partnerships, customer support, and more. ""[Google] sees this opportunity and sees their competitors have developed a beachhead first,"" Gartner senior research director Rick Franzosa told Business Insider. ""What manufacturers are looking for and what the vendors are looking for is really that utility, unlimited speed and storage, unlimited capacity in order to run applications."" Here's why cloud giants are keen on capturing more market share in manufacturing: Why Google Cloud, AWS, and Microsoft are betting on the manufacturing industry The cloud — including cloud-based AI tools — gives manufacturers the ability to process and analyze the vast troves of data that they have coming in from their machines.",KMT,en,Business Insider
