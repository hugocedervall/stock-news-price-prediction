Yet toxic substances circulate in waterways and bloodstreams, leached out from all the consumables of everyday life. Shortsightedness and paltry data in the cycles of product design and engineering are partly to blame for this collateral damage of modern chemistry. Most product designers are unlettered in chemistry, and the practice of green chemistry remains in its early years. Even a basic count of all the industrial chemicals in use is scarce — somewhere over 80,000 , according to the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act Inventory, although the EPA total for recent output is less than 9,000 . It's simply asking too much of most people formulating a consumer product only to include ingredients that are proven not to harm living systems.

The company patented a design for such a smartphone with the WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization) and the patent was approved last month, reports LetsGoDigital. The HP patent describes a technology for applying flexible screens to mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets or computers. Although similar to the folding method of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip, the HP patent describes it as 'using a movable hinge that can be folded in different positions' and is not limited to folding in half. However, it is not necessary that HP would launch such a product in the market. In 2016, HP Inc unveiled Elite x3, a 5.96-inch touchscreen device that ran Windows 10 Mobile and supported Continuum, a feature that allowed the device to be attached seamlessly to a separate screen, mouse and keyboard. Earlier, Huawei also filed a new patent for a new clamshell design foldable phone.","HP,HPQ",en,Sify.com

Since it’s unclear how long mandatory work-from-home measures will be required, employers need to put best practices in place now to keep employees and their work safe. “It’s easier to secure everyone when they’re all sitting in the same office,” says Michael Howard, HP’s chief security consultant for print. “But when you start looking at everyone working from home — the complexity of keeping everybody secure becomes much more difficult.” To read this article in full, please click here",HP,en,CSOonline

These strategies may be controversial, but they also seem to work; Netflix, founded in 1997, has reached a $227 billion market cap since going public in 2002. On a recent episode of the podcast Starting Up , Hastings told Insider's Global Editor-in-Chief Nich Carlson about his new book "" No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention ,"" which he co-wrote with author Erin Meyer. The book dives into the policies that made the company unique. For example, Netflix's ""Keeper Test"" urges managers to frequently evaluate whether they should fire or keep employees. ""If you're going to be the coach of the team that wins the Olympics, you better have incredible players at every position or you're not going to win the gold medal,"" Hastings told Carlson. ""We're trying to win the championship of film and television…and to do that we have to have an Olympic caliber team.""

Airtel’s RMS too climbed 391 bps on-quarter to 34.8%, driven by 13% sequential growth in revenue from national long distance (NLD) services and higher revenue inflows in its top markets.“The magnitude and nature of VIL’s RMS loss in the fiscal first quarter is a reminder that sector consolidation is far from over and the market is moving steadily towards a duopoly, with market share shifts continuing towards Jio and Airtel,” Jeffries said in a note.The brokerage said the telco’s sharp market-share declines in the metros and category-A circles -- where there are many dual-SIM users -- also suggested subscribers are consolidating their usage/spends away from VIL.ICICI Securties said VIL was the most impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, likely due to its higher dependence on 2G revenue, which was severely hurt in the fiscal first quarter.Brokerage Emkay Global said much of VIL’s sequential decline in the June quarter revenue is “attributed to sharp declines in its adjusted gross revenue (AGR) in Delhi (- 89%), Mumbai (- 40%), Kerala (- 49%) and HP (- 50%).",HP,en,Economic Times India

Deutsche Bank’s Jeriel Ong lowered his price target on HPE from $17 to $15, on account of “recent hardware and market wide weakness.” Nonetheless, investors stand to take home a 74% gain should the new target be met over the next 12 months. Accordingly, the analyst maintained his bullish stance on the tech giant with a Buy rating. (To watch Ong’s track record, click here ) Despite the target reduction, Ong remains confident in the company’s model. Following a chat with HP investor relations, the analyst is “more puzzled with HPE's YTD relative stock decline.” HP’s Share price has been hit hard since the coronavirus outbreak and is down by 50% year-to-date. Among the key takeaways from the conversation, Ong notes HP’s relatively small exposure to industries heavily affected by the outbreak. To wit, COVID-19’s impact is unequal, and dependent upon size and sector. Smaller businesses with less cash flow are more likely to bear the brunt, as opposed to large companies and those in the public sector.","HPE,HP,HPQ",en,Nasdaq

With all of the various makes, models, and product types out there, buying the best laptop that suits your needs has become an awfully involved process. After all, laptops are complex machines, with differences even within the same line of product. So, here are the three key aspects to consider when buying that best laptop: Operating system : A laptop's operating system (OS) is the interface through which you access everything in the computer, from work apps to games and more.

At the Handelsblatt industrial summit on Friday, Chinese ambassador to Germany Ken Wu told ex-Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel that if Germany excludes Huawei 5G from its communication networks, then China could ""declare German cars unsafe"" for its domestic market. ""It is important to the Chinese government that Chinese companies in Germany are treated the same as others, without discrimination. If the German government made a decision that led to the exclusion of Huawei from the German market, it will have consequences - the Chinese government will not stand idly by. See, last year, 28 million cars were sold in China, 7 million of those were German. Can we just declare German cars unsafe, because we can make our own cars?

2019-12-10 09:34:06-05:00,China will phase out foreign technology from government and public institutions by 2023,"The Chinese government mandated that all government offices and public institutions must replace foreign-supplied hardware and software by 2023, according to Financial Times. The government will gradually phase out affected foreign technology under its 3-5-2 policy — 30% of hardware will be replaced in 2020, 50% in 2021, and 20% in 2022. The Chinese government's move to shut out foreign tech firms, while remarkable, is unlikely to significantly impact any one international tech company. The Chinese government is estimated to replace between 20 million and 30 million pieces of hardware and their accompanying operating systems over the next three years. While this could affect sales for companies like HP, Dell, and Microsoft, these companies have likely been preparing for the possibility of losing any contracts they may have with the public sector, given similar governmental efforts in recent years. The move to use exclusively domestic-made tech is part of a larger desire of the Chinese government, which has wanted to remove foreign tech from key parts of the government since at least 2014.",HP,en,Business Insider

2019-12-09 16:18:50-05:00,How to think about 3D printing in 2020,"One of the most consequential aspects of 3D printing is the capability to produce objects that often cannot be manufactured using any other existing technology. At a fundamental level, 3D printing, or additive manufacturing, can consolidate parts in a single assembly. One famous example is the GE Catalyst turboprop engine, where 3D printing enabled the consolidation of 855 parts into 12 assemblies, reducing weight and simplifying the supply chain in the process. At a higher level, the technology allows the creation of “previously unimagined complex shapes,” noted Paul Benning, Chief Technologist for HP Printing & Digital Manufacturing. That creates unprecedented design opportunities, but to take full advantage of them, design engineers need to retool their thought process. “You have a world of designers who have been trained in and grown up with existing technologies like injection molding. Because of this, people unintentionally bias their design toward legacy processes and away from technologies like 3D printing,” said Benning.",HP,en,PlasticsToday

It's not clear if the escalation is in retaliation to the Trump administration's US blockade on Huawei technology in US government offices earlier this year.

Since then, the companies have been holding a series of meetings with officials in the environment ministry to resolve the issue, without much luck so far. Experts say if the stalemate continues, it could well hurt their sales for the April-June quarter.“These companies have made representations to us and they have accepted that compliance is an issue,” CK Mishra, secretary, ministry of environment, forests and climate change, told ET.“Meanwhile, we are trying to see whether they have moved towards compliance, so the ministry has asked CPCB to look at their commitments and see how this issue can be resolved,” he said.The companies claim that the CPCB’s decision to revoke their import permits is disproportionate to the rule violations, especially since they have exceeded their targets for collection of e-wastes and have faulted only on minor compliance issues such as not seeking prior approval from authorities concerned before shutting down a centre and opening another, and not raising awareness at their centres, including putting up of posters.68842713 “We feel this is a huge overreach of e-waste management rules.",HP,en,The Economic Times India

Apotheker was the prime architect of the Autonomy acquisition in 2011, but was booted out before the deal closed. HP subsequently wrote $8.8 billion off Autonomy's value. Apotheker appeared as a witness for HP during its $5 billion civil suit against former Autonomy CEO Mike Lynch and former CFO Sushovan Hussain. He is considered to be one of the most disastrous CEOs in tech, and his rationale for pushing the deal through is under the microscope in court. History has not been kind to Leo Apotheker. The German-born tech executive is best known as the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, and one of the shortest-tenured bosses in tech after being booted out after just 12 months .
