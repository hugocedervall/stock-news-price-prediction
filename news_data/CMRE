Containerized import demand is not abating and cargo volumes are now backing up at anchorage. The Port of Los Angeles Signal tool offers a short-term indicator of market strength. Ship charter rates provide a longer-term bellwether. In both cases, the latest data shows no evidence of any trans-Pacific demand respite. In fact, the numbers point in the opposite direction. Signal spike and what it means It takes two to three weeks for containers to cross the Pacific Ocean from China to California. The number of arriving boxes can be determined in advance. The Port of Los Angeles released The Signal , a tool powered by Port Optimizer, to show what’s en route. Nine of the top 10 carriers calling in Los Angeles feed their data into the system. Since August, the weekly numbers have bounced around between 100,000 and 130,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs).",CMRE,en,Zero Hedge

2020-05-19 16:27:51-05:00,Container-Ship Owners In Crossfire As Liners Slash Service,"Container-ship lessors represent one of the most crowded segments in the U.S.-listed shipping arena – and one of the most highly leveraged to COVID-19. Such owners, known as ""tonnage providers,"" lease vessels for varying lengths of time to liner companies, which use chartered ships to complement their owned fleets. If global consumer demand rebounds robustly, stocks of tonnage providers should surge. If there's an extended downturn, they face years of pain. Liners have heavily ""blanked"" (canceled) sailings to cut costs and prop up freight rates in the wake of lower consumer demand. The longer fleet capacity exceeds coronavirus-reduced demand, the more likely that liners will permanently reduce fleet size by letting expiring charters roll off without renewal, and possibly even seek to renegotiate rates on long-term charters. As IHS Markit (NYSE: INFO ) Director of Transportation Consulting Paul Bingham recently told FreightWaves, ""The whole reason carriers deliberately have a portfolio-management strategy [fleets partially owned, partially chartered] is that you don't want to get stuck with a 100% owned fleet at a time like this.",CMRE,en,Benzinga Feeds

2020-01-29 16:16:30-05:00,Container Lines Face Intensifying Cost Squeeze,"If you want to make money in container shipping, better to lease out mega-ships to the liner companies than to be a liner company operating those vessels, paying the fuel bills and catering to cargo customers. Container-ship lessor Costamare (NYSE: CMRE ) is a case in point. On the quarterly analyst call, Gregory Zikos, Costamare's chief financial officer, reported that ""larger vessels have enjoyed a rising charter market and today there's a limited supply. Charter rates for larger vessels have been rising faster than those of smaller vessels."" Costamare cited data from Clarksons showing that one-year time-charter rates have reached $30,000 a day for container ships with capacity to carry 8,500 twenty-foot-equivalent units (TEU). Chart credit: Costamare According to Zikos, there is now more interest in three- to five-year charters beyond the standard one-year term. ""The gap [in pricing] between a one-year and three- to five-year charter is not as wide as it has been in the past,"" he said, pointing out that ""some years ago, there was no three- to five-year market for larger vessels at all, and now we are seeing these deals."" When liner companies agree to multi-year charters at pricing that's at less of a discount to one-year rates than before, it implies that they're more concerned about future rate inflation and are more inclined to lock in capacity now to protect themselves.",CMRE,en,Benzinga Feeds
