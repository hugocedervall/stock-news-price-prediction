2020-01-09 09:28:25-05:00,What Is Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR)?,"There is more than one way to answer that question. First, there is the more technical, more politically correct, definition that the railroads would likely prefer, which would be something like the following. Precision Scheduled Railroading, or PSR, is the operational method of running a railroad for maximum asset utilization by which freight movements are scheduled and managed on the individual carload (rather than entire train level). That contributes to efficiency improvements by, for instance, using more direct point-to-point routing, bypassing classification terminals, and having the flexibility to use long mixed-commodity trains. Then, there are other descriptions that are less flattering to the railroads, such as: PSR is a ""slash-and-burn"" removal of expenses and headcount. Or, PSR is ""Positive Shareholder Reaction,"" buzzwords for the railroads to market themselves, not to customers, but to Wall Street. What can be agreed upon is that PSR generally involves eliminating classification yards, consolidating dispatch centers, greatly reducing headcount, and reducing capital budgets with the ultimate objectives of greatly improving a railroad's margins and returns on invested capital through greater asset utilization.",CP,en,Benzinga Feeds

Six investigators have been deployed to the site, led by Rob Johnston, a CP veteran who has served in senior roles with the TSB since 2001. Investigators are recovering mechanical and track components from the derailment, and the team plans to examine all 33 tank cars to evaluate tank performance.

He said he hasn't seen anything to change his outlook for 2019, which was lowered from a modest revenue increase to a modest 1-2% decline during the summer. Heading into the fourth quarter of 2019, Foote thought coal would see declines of more than 10%, but those declines have accelerated recently. Through the week ended Nov. 30, CSX's coal carloads are 17.2% lower quarter-to-date but still well off the heavier declines earlier in the year (-38.3% year-to-date).
