(CNSX: VREO) (OTCQX: VREOF ) revealed third-quarter revenue of $13.4 million. That's up by 68% year-over-year. The physician-led cannabis company generated revenue in seven states during the third quarter: New Mexico, Minnesota, Ohio, New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Arizona. Its quarterly adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $675,808, which stands against a loss of $5.2 million in the same quarter of the prior year. Net income hovered $122,252, compared to a net loss of $14.6 million in the corresponding period of 2019. Vireo attributes the boost to a gain of $16.4 million on the divestiture of the company’s PAMS subsidiary. ""Our third-quarter results demonstrate the improving nature of our business and success of recent initiatives to improve operating and financial performance,"" chairman and CEO Kyle Kingsley says.

Tyler Durden Sun, 11/15/2020 - 15:55 Authored by Lance Roberts via RealInvestmentAdvice.com, I recently have discussed both the “Importance of Recessions” and how the ongoing “ Rescues Ruining Capitalism.” However, while the data is clear that ongoing stimulus programs lead to weaker economic growth and a rising wealth gap, is the Fed stuck with “forever stimulus?” Such was a point that Mohammed El-Erian recently made, stating: “They are increasingly on what I call a no-exit paradigm.” To understand the problem, we have to go back to the beginning. As we noted in our article on financial rescues, the bailouts and stimulus programs started in 2008 when the Federal Reserve intervened with the insolvency of Bear Stearns. They haven’t stopped since. To date, the Federal Reserve, and the Government, have pumped more than $36 Trillion into the economy. As shown below, the amount of economic growth achieved has been minimal during that same time frame. (The chart is the cumulative growth of interventions compared to the incremental increase in GDP.)

While it seems logical, the reality will be quite different as weak economic growth rates force the Fed to monetize the entirety of future debt issuances. The Inflation Premise To fully explain why the Fed is now trapped, we must start with the inflation premise. The consensus expectation is the massive increases in monetary stimulus will spark inflationary pressures. Using the money supply as a proxy, we can compare the money supply changes to inflation. What we find is since 1980, increases in the money supply tend to precede periods of below-average inflation. Such tends to contradict the mainstream belief that increases in the money supply will lead to hyper-inflation due to the currency’s devaluation. Collapse Of Velocity Such has not been the case since 1990 as the byproduct of the money supply, known as “monetary velocity,” has been non-existent.",RBC,en,Zero Hedge

Some critics thought that was an almost nonsensical statement to make, while the credulous took it at face value. It framed whoever perpetrated the attacks as some inhuman “other” that despised happiness itself. It was unthinkable anybody could have an actual foreign-policy derived reason for doing it, and anybody who suggested as much was usually hounded out of the public eye. However I always thought that utterance did have a kernel of truth to it. If you looked at the United States as a global empire , and that the freedoms “ they” hated were not actually the ones to assemble, or worship or to vote, as Bush intimated, but rather the ones where America acted unilaterally in its own interest observing American Exceptionalism as a type of infallible axiom, then Bush would have been closer to the substance of the matter.",RBC,en,Zero Hedge
