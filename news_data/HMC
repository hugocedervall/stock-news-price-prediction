2020-12-07 09:35:09-05:00,McKinsey says COVID-19 is just one of many supply-chain disruptions CEOs need to prepare for going forward,"Summary List Placement The coronavirus was the first major shock to the intricate network of supply chains that keep the auto industry humming since the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011. Fukushima hit Japanese car production hard because factories in that region of the country were supplying factories around the world, including in the US. Honda and Toyota recovered relatively quickly, but the accident spurred a discussion about how to improve the resilience of supply chains, the management of which is critical to a globalized system of ""just in time"" manufacturing, where companies maintain lean inventories and calibrate production to match demand. No one talked enough, however, to prepare for the coronavirus pandemic. In late 2019 and early 2020, the virus idled auto manufacturing in China, the world's largest market, before later shutting down North America and Europe for more than a month. Going beyond resiliency Carmakers are still grappling with the ongoing impact of revamping their operations to stress worker safety, and those moves have extended to the convoluted supply chain that feeds into the assembly plants. ""Resilience is not a new topic,"" Asutosh Padhi, a senior partner in McKinsey & Company's Chicago office who works with industrial clients, told Business Insider. ""But for the first time, in 2020 100% of company boards have had a discussion about resilience in supply chains."" Zeroing in on supply chains has indeed become a priority for the leadership of the world's largest companies. ""I am spending more time anticipating where new issues may surface, and trying to get ahead of them to the extent possible to ensure we continue to support our employees and customers,"" Alicia Boler Davis, Amazon's VP of global customer fulfillment, told Business Insider earlier this year . ""This is a CEO-level topic that's transformational,"" Padhi said. ""Everybody has been to the emergency room.",HMC,en,Business Insider

2020-12-03 19:01:05-05:00,Getting to the truth: What Astongate can teach us about lifecycle assessments,"Ramon Arratia of Ball Corporation explains why carbon emissions analysis should compare today's products with those of the future, rather than those of the past This week a host of media outlets reported on a study that made heavily-disputed claims about the environmental credentials of electric cars. The analysis found an electric car would have to travel as far as 50,000 miles before it recorded a carbon footprint saving over a petrol model. The report was commissioned by major automotive manufacturers including Aston Martin, McLaren, and Honda, and follows the government's announcement that new petrol cars and vans will not be sold in the UK from 2030. The implication of the report is clear - electric vehicles are so beset by problems they're not worth bothering with. Earlier this week its analysis was shot down by a wealth of experts including Dutch electric vehicles researcher Auke Hoekstra. Hoekstra pointed out carbon parity is achieved at 16,000 miles - more than 30,000 fewer than reported by the automotive companies.",HMC,en,BusinessGreen

2020-11-28 09:43:22-05:00,Winning the electric car race is just the beginning of Elon Musk's plan for Tesla (TSLA),"Summary List Placement The idea that automakers are racing to commercialize electric cars — and that one or some of them will come out on top — has always been flawed. For starters, the auto industry is huge: More than a billion passenger vehicles are roaming the planet, with another 80 million or so joining them every year. No single victor could satisfy that level of demand. This was obvious even in the early days of the auto industry, when scores of carmakers, engine-makers, and coachbuilders were competing to put Americans and Europeans behind the wheel. Yes, there were obvious winners and losers: Henry Ford captured a huge amount of market share early on with his Model T, then General Motors grew itself into a competitor and took the lead. But more than a century on, both are carrying on, more or less fine. That's not how races work. In the 20th century, plenty of other famous names got in on the action.

Since such an assessment must be charged to the period’s profit and loss account, their profitability could reduce further in an environment where the industry is already squeezed by the Covid-induced lockdowns.Auditors are questioning if some of the assets still hold the value that is reflected in the balance sheets.

Here's how the CEO makes and spends his fortune.,"Advertisers including Verizon, Honda, and Ben & Jerry's are boycotting Facebook over the social network's lack of hate-speech moderation. The boycott is sinking both Facebook's share price and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's net worth. Zuckerberg has a net worth of $82.3 billion , making him the fourth-richest person in the world. Zuckerberg drives an affordable car and wears basic clothes, but appears to splurge on real estate, buying houses and then buying the surrounding properties for privacy. Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan are generous philanthropists, investing billions in childhood education and medical research that they hope will cure all diseases in their children's lifetimes. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. Mark Zuckerberg is a few billion dollars less rich as Facebook's advertiser boycott continues to grow. Zuckerberg has faced fierce criticism for refusing to moderate Facebook posts in which President Trump called civil rights protesters ""thugs"" and suggested violence when he wrote, ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" in the wake of George Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police officers .",HMC,en,Business Insider

Insider Intelligence analyzes this industry and several others to provide in-depth analyst reports, proprietary forecasts, customizable charts, and more. Learn more about what we offer. Facebook's advertiser boycott is gaining steam: Last Friday, Unilever became the largest company to commit to pulling ad spend on the platform — and not just for July, as the boycott calls for, but for the rest of 2020. In response, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reversed his original stance Friday afternoon, saying the company would ""start labeling posts it deems newsworthy but that also violates its policies,"" though this doesn't necessarily address all of the boycott's recommendations . More advertisers joining the boycott could cause a domino effect. Last week, we predicted that even with a growing number of advertisers boycotting, it was unlikely to affect Facebook's ad revenues. But this major pullback from Unilever — and a growing number of brands that have joined since we last covered it, including Verizon and Honda — could change that.

The first race of the 2020 NTT INDYCAR SERIES, delayed three months by the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, took place without spectators and with limited crew members on a hot night in Fort Worth , Texas.

At the front of the field, pole qualifier Josef Newgarden took the early lead, but it soon became apparent that Dixon and his Chip Ganassi Racing teammate, Felix Rosenqvist , had two of the quickest cars in the field. Passing Newgarden for the lead on Lap 32, Dixon was rarely headed for the rest of the night, at times opening up leads of five seconds or more on the fast, 1.5-mile TMS oval.",HMC,en,Benzinga Feeds

Esports and gaming have burst into the mainstream in recent years, transforming from a vibrant niche to a central form of entertainment around the world. While esports may have once stood for a subset of sports culture, it has grown into a full industry in its own right. That shift has been powered by championing from mainstream celebrities like Michael Jordan, Drake, and DJ Marshmello, an increasing amount of coverage from traditional outlets like ESPN, and, at least in part, the breakneck rise of Fortnite. As competitive gaming cements itself in the popular culture, global investors, brands, media outlets, and consumers are all paying attention.

The company launched its first electric motorcycle, the $29,799 LiveWire, last August. “We’ll expand our profitable iconic heritage bikes to excite our existing customers,” CEO Jochen Zeitz told investors this week. “We also remain committed to … advancing our efforts in electric,” he added, before the company revealed a 45 percent drop in quarterly profits. While unlikely to appeal to freewheeling Harley-Davidson purists, the LiveWire was drawing praise even before launch and has raised eyebrows since thanks to stunts such as beating a Tesla Model 3 in a drag race and travelling 1,000 miles in 24 hours (thanks to fast charging). Perhaps surprisingly given its classic heritage, Harley-Davidson is something of an early mover in the electric motorcycle market, compared to other traditional manufacturers. Other industry leaders such as Honda and Kawasaki also boast electric models, but to a large extent the nascent e-motorcycle market is occupied by electric-only startups such as Energica and Zero.","HOG,HMC",en,Green Technology

The pan-European arrangement will see SNAM collect and recycle batteries from Honda's growing number of hybrid and electric vehicles and either prepare them for 'second-life' renewable energy storage uses or extract valuable materials for recycling if they are not suitable for that purpose. The expanded partnership builds on a relationship that has been in place since 2013 and is designed to ensure the traceability of end-of-life batteries and dispose of them in accordance with EU environmental standards. The expansion of the agreement will see SNAM collect Lithium-ion and Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries from across Honda's dealer network and Authorised Treatment Facilities (ATF) in 22 countries, before analysing how suitable they are for recycling and processing them accordingly. ""As demand for Honda's expanding range of hybrid and electric cars continues to grow so does the requirement to manage batteries in the most environmentally-friendly way possible,"" said Tom Gardner, senior vice president at Honda Motor Europe. ""Recent market developments may allow us to make use of these batteries in a second life application for powering businesses or by using recent improved recycling techniques to recover useful raw materials which can be used as feedstock into the production of new batteries.""

Just two of the biggest tech companies, Apple and Microsoft, brought in a whopping 15% of the total return on the S&P 500 last year. It was truly an impressive performance. But for return-minded investors, the tech giants are not the only game in town.

There is a supply shock to global manufacturing as many factories in the world’s supply chain will be shuttered for longer, which shifts the global supply curve left, increasing-price and production pressures. Ergo component shortages, higher prices, and lower production. The 2 percent decline in the U.S. stock market and collapse in bond yields are signaling a potential global aggregate demand shock that offsets the supply shock.

Autonomous vehicle (AV) developer Cruise unveiled Origin, an all-electric driverless car concept that illustrates the company's vision for consumer behavior in driverless cars. The vehicle spurns the driver's seat in favor of an airy, symmetrical cabin featuring small displays mounted above two sets of opposing seats. While a car without driver controls would not yet be street legal in the US, Cruise CEO Dan Ammann called Origin a ""fully engineered vehicle that's on its way to production."" Favorable market positioning could help Cruise achieve this goal: General Motors owns the majority of the company, and Honda has committed billions for a 5.7% stake. Furthermore, it is widely considered one of the most advanced AV companies, having completed over 1 million test miles in San Francisco and reached a valuation around $19 billion in 2019, according to The Wall Street Journal.",HMC,en,Business Insider

The production at the Greater Noida plant, which has an annual capacity of 1.2 lakh units, has come down to almost 2500 units month -- i.e., capacity utilisation of less than 20%-30%.

California has had its waiver in place since the 1970 Clean Air Act. Trump maintains that removing the waiver would lead to cheaper and safer cars. But the auto industry has opposed the administration, arguing that it doesn't want to deal with multiple national standards and has already undertaken new-vehicle development based in California's rules. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. A group of 23 states on Friday sued to undo the Trump administration's determination that federal law bars California from setting stiff tailpipe emission standards and zero emission vehicle mandates. The states, led by California and joined by the District of Columbia, Los Angeles and New York City, are seeking a court order blocking a determination unveiled Thursday by the US Transportation Department and its agency the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, according to papers filed in the US District Court in Washington.",HMC,en,Business Insider

California's waiver was granted by the 1970 Clean Air Act. It's followed by numerous other states and shapes automakers' production and planning. The big car companies don't want to build cars for two national standards and favor California keeping its waiver. But Trump doesn't care — he wants to continue rolling back Obama-era progress on environmental issues. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. President Donald Trump, as he has demonstrated again and again since he was running for president in 2016, knows nothing about the modern auto industry. Worse, his handlers in the administration also appear to know nothing. This has created an incredibly difficult situation for US and foreign car companies. In Detroit, Trump's election was largely welcome; car makers loved the idea of a corporate tax cut, which Trump delivered. They also liked the idea of rolling back stringent federal fuel economy and emissions standards, established in the waning days of the Obama administration.",HMC,en,Business Insider

Scooters are often a second purchase in the family. And as the largest motorcycle manufacturer, that puts us in the best position we can be in – to offer both these options to our customers.

Growing environmental concerns have prompted governments and automotive manufacturers to shift to EVs as a way to combat negative environmental impacts. For instance, the U.S. government offers EV owners a federal tax credit for taking the step towards helping the environment. Moreover, the European Union has implemented regulations in order to limit the amount of diesel-powered vehicles on the road and eventually plans to transition to a fully electric system. A report by the European Environment Agency (EEA) also confirmed that the emission released from EVs are approximately 17% to 30% less than the emissions from petrol and diesel vehicles. The EEA says that EVs are much better for local air quality control due to their zero exhaust emissions at street levels. In addition, EVs are more environmentally efficient because they run on battery packs like lithium-ion battery packs, which are most commonly used within EVs.",HMC,en,Benzinga

The Indian unit accounted for more than 30% of Honda Motors’ global sales from scooters and motorcycles in FY18, making the country’s the No.1 market for it in this segment. India also accounted for 15% of Honda’s operating profit from the two-wheeler business.However, the company is unlikely to repeat the performance in the just-ended fiscal year due to tepid demand for its bread and butter products: scooters.

Despite the fact that they were crippling traditional sedan sales, Americans' transition to SUVs was seen as a silver lining, prompting many automakers to make infrastructure changes to account for the change in demand. Those days, however, seem to be over, according to the latest, February U.S. auto sales data. Fiat Chrysler posted its first monthly sales decline in a year, according to Bloomberg . The kicker? Jeep, the company's driving force for the past several years, showed a rare back-to-back drop in deliveries. Charlie Chesbrough, senior economist of Cox Automotive said: “ The results today suggest a much bigger story: The sales pace has finally shifted into a lower gear.” The fact that Jeep sales have slowed is a warning indicator that the SUV ""boom"" in the U.S. could be coming to an end. Mired by higher interest rates and continued tightening of credit, buyers are forcing once record high SUV sales and prices back down again.",HMC,en,Zero Hedge
