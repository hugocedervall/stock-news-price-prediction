A recent article in Bloomberg said: ""Deriving energy from waste has a long history, from simply burning trash to using it as a raw material for jet fuel… the county's population has grown, yielding more trash that needs either disposal or recycling… There's a natural resistance to landfill expansions,"" said the chairman of the Berkeley County Solid Waste Authority… In the heart of America's coal country, a cavernous new recycling plant is turning trash into a fuel that burns cleaner than coal, using a first-in-the-nation process hailing from Europe… The plant already has its first customer. A nearby cement plant owned by Argos USA LLC has agreed to buy and burn the garbage-based fuel. "" There is also another recent technology advance that can begin to help solve the problem. An article in FORBES added: ""At the current pace, it is estimated that the US will run out of landfill capacity by the year 2036, and even sooner in several regions.",ADSW,en,Benzinga
