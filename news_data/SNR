2020-08-07 12:15:27-05:00,"Delhi riots: HC asks police to follow law, not get influenced by senior's orders","New Delhi, Aug 7 (IANS) The Delhi High Court on Friday asked the investigating officers of the Delhi police to work in accordance with law and not get influenced by the instructions of their superiors while probing the Delhi riots which broke out in February. A single judge bench of the high court presided by Justice Suresh Kumar Kait also observed that no prejudice is caused to the people of any community by an order of Special Commissioner of Police (Crime & Economic Offences Wing) Praveer Ranjan to its teams probing the northeast Delhi riots asking them to exercise due care and precaution while making any arrests. The bench observed that since the accused persons have already been chargesheeted in the riots cases, so the July 8 order issued by the senior police officer will cause no prejudice to anyone. ""This period was unfortunate for everyone in Delhi. So, we should not continue this (petition) further,"" the judge said. The said observations came in while disposing of a petition which claimed that on July 8, Special CP (Crime & Economic Offences Wing) Praveer Ranjan wrote a letter to the probe teams, stating that there were anger and resentment among the Hindus in the Northeast Delhi after the recent arrests of some Hindu youth in connection with the Delhi riots.",SNR,en,Sify.com

2019-12-17 15:55:00-05:00,Boeing Suppliers Slide As 737 Max Production Halted,"Boeing Suppliers Slide As 737 Max Production Halted Shares in Boeing slid this week after the company announced on Monday afternoon that it would suspend production of its best selling plane, the 737 Max. The production halt has rippled down the supply chain, sent shares of some suppliers tumbling on Tuesday. Analysts told Reuters this is one of the biggest assembly-line halts in several decades, could continue to cost Boeing $1 billion per month despite the production freeze. ""Each supplier will likely be missing about 200 deliveries versus original plans, with about 80% of the shortfall coming in 2020 and the remainder in 2021,"" Melius Research analyst Carter Copeland wrote in a note. British engineering firm Senior Plc, whose biggest client is Boeing, saw shares plunge 11% on the production news. Shares in France's Safran SA dipped 1.50%, while General Electric was flat, both companies are in a joint venture to produce engines for the 737 Max. Copeland said U.S.-based Spirit, which manufactures the 737 Max's fuselage, is one of the most exposed suppliers, deriving at least half of its sales from Boeing. ""We assume (Spirit) will elect to stop production and furlough employees at the cost of $0.40 (per share) per month of the stoppage,"" Copeland said.",SNR,en,Zero Hedge
