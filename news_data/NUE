2019-04-09 11:24:00-05:00,U.S. Steel's stock tumbles after Credit Suisse turns bearish ahead of 'Sheet Tsunami',"Shares of U.S. Steel Corp. tumbled 8.0% in midday trade Tuesday, after Credit Suisse analyst Curt Woodworth turned bearish on the steel maker, citing a weakening of its competitive position ahead of the coming ""Sheet Tsunami."" Woodworth cut his rating to underperform, after downgrading the stock to neutral from outperform in January. He slashed his price target to $13, which was 29% below current levels. Woodworth expects a ""Sheet Tsunami"" period in the U.S. from 2021 to 2022, when the next wave of low cost, hot-rolled coil (HRC) focused sheet supply is expected to ramp in the U.S., with HRC prices expected to fall to about $610 per ton from 2019/2020 assumptions of $700 per ton. Given the rise in unit costs the past several years, and the loss of automotive market share, U.S. Steel ""is in a weaker competitive position"" relative to its peers entering this period of lower pricing, Woodworth wrote in a note to clients. Meanwhile, shares of rival steelmakers also fell, just not as much, with AK Steel Holding Corp. down 3.1%, Nucor Corp. shedding 1.3%, Commercial Metals Co. losing 0.5% and Steel Dynamics Inc. giving up 1.9%.",NUE,en,Yahoo Finance
