Observers wondered whether mega-lines like Carnival, prevented from sailing in US waters by CDC edicts since March, might even survive. It wasn't just passenger tickets and onboard meals that businesses like Carnival were losing out on. Luxury retail at Carnival alone is thought to make up $300 million, according to one expert . And those losses in retail made up part of Carnival's 50% decline in revenue in the 12 months ending on August 2020 . Malls have become a mainstay of mega-ship design, from duty-free staples like liquor and tobacco to onboard galleries selling prints and paintings and an increasing number of branded boutiques from luxury marques like Bulgari. There was a glimmer of hope when the CDC lifted its sailing ban. But incidents like the one on the private cruise line SeaDream , where positive COVID-19 cases popped up despite precautions, have confirmed that the cruise industry's recovery will be a long and complicated one.",MC,en,Business Insider

The dudes of the original skateboarding boom, now in their 40s, are now vastly outnumbered in skate parks by teenagers. In the late 90s and early 00s, rap and hip-hop became integrated with skate culture ; skate videos ditched the grungy VHS aesthetic and fish-eye lenses for faster cuts and smoother shots. Fast-forward to 2020 and the kids that grew up with this culture are now paying homage.

Their big vision for how to do this focuses on introducing contactless technology that can significantly reduce the number of surfaces you need to touch in the lobby and in your hotel room. These changes may make stir-crazy travelers feel better about staying in a hotel. But since COVID-19 mostly spreads through interaction with other people, contactless tech may not curb transmission unless it is accompanied by social distancing and hand washing. What does a contactless hotel look like? You arrive in the foyer, but you’ve already checked into your room through the hotel’s mobile app, so you head to the elevators, bags in tow. Once you find your room, you tap a button in that same mobile app to unlock the door. That same app allows you to control the temperature, turn on the television, and order room service.","MC,MAR",en,Fast Company

The pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus has put these investors back in the spotlight. UBS recently projected that more than $1 trillion in corporate debt may become distressed. Click here for more BI Prime stories . Billionaire Marc Lasry, the founder of Avenue Capital and a longtime player in the distressed-investing space, didn't shy away from the question. At a New York Alternative Investment Roundtable event in early February, when the novel coronavirus that has since sent markets plummeting was still mostly confined to Asia, Lasry said that distress investing might not need a recession to pick back up, but it definitely wouldn't hurt. ""We need to have problems, because the more problems there are, the better it is,"" said Lasry, who co-owns the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks.",MC,en,Business Insider

How we dress feeds off cravings to be different as well as part of a tribe; to be en vogue but ahead of the pack. The message from the high street is that such wishes can be fulfilled, and fast fashion plays on the idea that hunger can be sated immediately. But to overcome such urges we need to reflect on the fragility of our planet. This means accepting that there is a better way to keep the pleasures of fashion open to all parts of society than promoting disposable clothes as desirable. This is not just about the high cost of the £4 dress ; luxury retailers such as Louis Vuitton have offered small collections every two weeks.
