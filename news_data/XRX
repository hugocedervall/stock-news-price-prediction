Activist investor Carl Icahn added to a stake last week. Financial companies and an options exchange operator saw insiders buying too. Conventional wisdom says that insiders and 10% shareholders really only buy shares of a company for one reason -- they believe the stock price will rise and they want to profit from it. So insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors, particularly when markets are near all-time highs. Though buy windows remain closed for many insiders during earnings-reporting season, plenty of others have continued to add shares despite market volatility and economic uncertainty. Here are some of the most noteworthy insider purchases reported in the past week. Carl Icahn, a 10% shareholder of Xerox Holdings Corp.

The art and science of macro investing is comparing past business cycles with the present across a mosaic of different indicators and time frames to determine the most probable path forward for markets. Throughout time, financial markets and the economy have been intimately linked to cycles of expansion and contraction of money and credit. The Federal Reserve was created by bankers and enacted by Congress in 1913 to provide a more flexible and stable monetary and financial system, but by no means did the Fed repeal the business cycle. In fact, the central bank has often played a role in amplifying booms and busts. For example, after introducing large-scale purchases of government securities to stem the recession of 1923, the Fed continued to expand the money supply and suppress interest rates through the remainder of the 1920s.",XRX,en,Zero Hedge

After all, Microsoft started its journey to becoming a trillion dollar company with Windows 95 after ripping off Apple, who ripped off their operating system from Xerox. And that trend in technology is still apparent today with Facebook, who is now testing a ""Nextdoor"" style feature called Neighborhoods, that allows users to join community based groups. When you enter a profile and address it allows you to join a local neighborhood so you can display posts and content just among neighbors, including people who may not be friends. ""Won't you be my neighbor?"" Facebook told Bloomberg about the feature: ""More than ever, people are using Facebook to participate in their local communities.

In a new incarnation of the program, a prominent Silicon Valley name is reaching out to hard-charging startups and hoisting them onto its platform where customers can buy the startups' services with one click. The new trend shows how high startups have risen as competitors, and how much Microsoft is willing to hustle and do business with them — with Abormal, featured in the Wall Street Journal as the first startup chosen for the program, as the test case.
