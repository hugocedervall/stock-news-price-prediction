Mid-caps, often referred to as ""Goldilocks"" stocks, offer a 1-2 punch of financial stability you don't get from small caps, but also greater growth potential than many large caps. As 2020 proved, large size doesn't guarantee success. From big oil stocks like Halliburton ( HAL ) that couldn't shake low oil prices to cruise giants like Royal Caribbean ( RCL ) that were hit hard by COVID-sparked travel bans, we learned that bigger doesn't always mean better when you're entrenched in a sector that's doing poorly. Of course, if it's tough for the big boys, then it's often even tougher for the little guys. Smaller companies suffering from similar downtrends, but without the deep pockets to stay afloat, have been folding altogether. Global corporate defaults already are at their highest levels since 2009 – and according to Fitch Ratings , they're on pace to top even the highs set during the worst of the financial crisis.",HAL,en,Kiplinger Washington Editors

In some ways, it’s been devastating already when you think of so many people out of work and struggling to get by. Today’s weekly new jobless claims of more than 4.4 million, the oil market collapse, and companies pulling their guidance all reflect economic upheaval.

Brent was down US$1.18, or 4.2%, at US$26.90 (RM117.55) a barrel by 1321 GMT, while the front-month May West Texas Intermediate (WTI) contract fell US$5.88, or 32%, to US$12.39 (RM54.14). At one point, the contract hit a low of US$10.77 a barrel, the lowest since 1998. However, analysts said the sell-off was exaggerated by the contract's imminent expiry. ""The May contract is set to expire tomorrow and the bulk of the open interest and volume is already in the June contract,"" said ING's head of commodities strategy, Warren Patterson. The spread between the front-month contract and the second month was almost US$11, the widest in history, as the June contract, which is more actively traded, fell US$2.04, or 8.1%, to US$22.99 a barrel.

Did India miss its moon landing by a whisker? The tense moments ominously flashed back to what K Sivan, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), said about the landing back in July: “15 minutes of terror.” As the lander named after the father of India’s space programme, Vikram Sarabhai, began its descent at 1.37 am IST on Saturday, scientists at the Bengaluru command centre had to just wait and watch.Just four hours before that, at 9.30 pm, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached Bengaluru, scientists had updated the autonomous control system of the lander with the latest imagery of the landing slots on the moon, taken from the orbiter above. The final descent is similar to a driverless car going on earth’s roads. Unlike the driverless car, where the algorithm is constantly trained with data on the routes, this was new territory for Vikram as well as for any space agency — this was the first ever attempt to land on the polar region of the lunar surface.As a nation watched, deep into the night, Sivan confirmed his worst fears.",HAL,en,The Economic Times India

Buy these stocks to profit from the reversal.,"Value stocks have underperformed their growth counterparts throughout the 10-year bull market. It's been even more noticeable since the beginning of May, when expectations of an economic slowdown and interest-rate cut began to build. According to Goldman Sachs, there's now a wide valuation gap between cheap and expensive stocks that could close in favor of bargain hunters. Goldman's equity analysts updated their basket of cheap stocks with the highest expected returns relative to their six-month implied volatilities. Click here for more BI Prime stories . Bargain hunting in the stock market isn't what it used to be. The strategy of buying stocks that are trading cheaply relative to the broader market — so-called value investing — has lagged since the financial crisis. In this lengthy bull market, investors have earned greater returns by buying richly valued stocks that hold the promise of strong earnings growth, particularly those in the technology sector. This dynamic has notably been at play since early May, when investors began to reassess their expectations for economic growth and the Federal Reserve this year, according to equity strategists at Goldman Sachs.",HAL,en,Business Insider
