2020-03-23 02:53:15-05:00,Caught out? UK supermarkets accused of 'turning blind eye' to unsustainable fish feed,"Investigation indicates UK shoppers may be indirectly and unknowingly consuming wild fish in their farmed fish products The UK's leading supermarkets are being accused of ""turning a blind eye"" to environmentally destructive fishing practices linked to the farmed seafood they sell, after a study found consumers may be unknowingly and indirectly eating hundreds of thousands of tonnes of wild fish. The study, which was carried out by NGO Changing Markets Foundation and environmental campaign group Feedback, shines a spotlight on the widespread use of fishmeal and fish oil (FMFO) - often sourced from fish caught in the wild - to feed farmed seafood. With more than 90 per cent of the world's marine fish stocks estimated to be fished to their limit or overfished, according to a UN report , farmed seafood is often seen as a more sustainable alternative to fishing at sea. However, as much as a fifth of global wild fish and seafood catch is used to produce FMFO to supply farmed livestock, fish, and seafood, according to previous research by Changing Markets.",MPX,en,BusinessGreen
