2020-12-08 10:10:23-05:00,3 COVID Stocks Not To Neglect,"There are now over 60 million COVID-19 cases worldwide, and they're continuing to rise. Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ) and Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA ) gave the world hope as their candidates showed 90% efficacy. But, besides these pharma stars, there are many other COVID-19 stocks that shouldn't be neglected. Uncovering a new opportunity The impending release of the above vaccines has created an abundant opportunity for companies that supply ultra-low temperature freezers as well as those which will ship them across the globe. Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE: TMO ) and United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS ) are up to the task. Freezers Demand for freezers could be through the roof as Pfizer's vaccine needs to be stored at negative 70 degrees Celsius, which is South Pole-like temperature, unlike Moderna's vaccine that requires a regular freezer at 20 degrees Celsius. Thermo Fisher's ULT freezers can accommodate both, as they can reach temperatures as low as negative 80 degrees Celsius. The created demand for these freezers will likely result into an improved top and bottom line for the healthcare company which is already a solid investment on its own merits.",TMO,en,Benzinga

Here's how they work and where to order one.,"Summary List Placement Among the hundreds of tests out there for the novel coronavirus, just a handful have received emergency authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration to ship them to people's homes. With at-home tests, people self-collect their samples and send them back to the testing company for analysis. Several companies are developing tests that can work fully at home without shipping and lab equipment involved, but they haven't received the FDA's go-ahead yet. Still, ordering a test from the comfort of home can be appealing. It not only avoids run-ins with the physical healthcare system, saving time, but also reduces the risk of spreading the virus or getting infected yourself. Lab giant Quest Diagnostics has sold about half a million home tests, though that number includes self-collected samples taken in drive-thrus, the company told Business Insider in October.

The fund managers outlined which thematic and single-stock strategies paid off for them this year, and they laid out their top trades and ideas for 2020. If you followed only financial-news headlines in 2019, you might assume the market had a tough year. Recession fears flared, trade-war tensions ebbed and flowed with ferocity, and corporate earnings growth slowed. Yet the benchmark S&P 500 was still up 19% year-to-date through the end of September. Thank the Federal Reserve and its overt willingness to continuing stimulating an economic expansion that's already the longest in history. But even amid a robust market environment that saw every major stock index climb for the year, a handful of fund managers stood out as the cream of the crop.

Success in the biopharma industry has always been about patents. The exclusive right to market life-saving treatments is how all the industry titans made their names. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE ) both amped up on R&D and the ensuing patents. As such, companies rise and fall on these developments, and can spend months, if not years, researching, developing, and testing a new compound. When they're successful, these major breakthroughs can be worth billions in revenue for those who commercialize these drugs. Many biopharma companies, such as, AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV ), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE: TMO ), and ImmunoPrecise Antibodies Ltd (OTCQB: IPATF ) (TSXV: IPA ), are hitting home runs in the pharmaceutical discovery process, which lands them lucrative and exclusive contracts with big pharma.

Potentially incentivized by a new study on the monoclonal antibody therapy market, analysts recently projected a double-digit 10.5% CAGR by 2022, and revenues to touch $140 billion . Driving this surge is the development of new therapeutic drugs from Big Pharma giants such as AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV ), Pfizer Inc.
