Companies like Regeneron, Eli Lilly, and AstraZeneca are using the body's own disease-fighting proteins, called antibodies, as the source material to develop coronavirus drugs. The leading efforts are now applying for emergency approval, with one even being used experimentally as part of President Donald Trump's COVID-19 treatment regimen. Six programs have started human testing, led by Lilly, Regeneron, Vir Biotechnology, AstraZeneca, Celltrion, and SAB Biotherapeutics. Lilly, Regeneron, Vir, and AstraZeneca are in the final stage of clinical testing. Lilly and Regeneron have both applied for emergency authorization for their drugs from the US Food and Drug Administration. Early human data suggest the treatments can slash the hospitalization rate and help people's immune systems fight the virus. The treatments are still experimental, with none having won regulatory approval for widespread use.","ABBV,AB",en,Business Insider

US regulators approved the virus-fighting drug remdesivir on Thursday, greenlighting its use in hospitalized patients. The US Food and Drug Administration had given an emergency OK for the drug's use in May. But it's unclear how well remdesivir, marketed as Veklury, works for patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Studies respectively led by the US National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization came to conflicting conclusions, with the WHO research casting doubt on the drug's benefits. ""It has an effect, but it doesn't really have an amazing effect that people were hoping it would have,"" Dr. Walid Gellad, director for the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing at the University of Pittsburgh, told Business Insider in a Friday phone interview. In squaring the findings of the main studies on remdesivir, longtime drug discovery researcher Derek Lowe wrote that ""for remdesivir, it looks like the argument now is 'Does it help a bit or just not at all?'""

Natco named its brand Dapnat, which will be available in 5mg and 10mg strengths. These products will be priced significantly lower than the two strengths of Farxiga (dapagliflozin) sold in India. While Natco has priced its two products at INR15 and INR19.50 respectively, AstraZeneca's Farxiga costs INR49 and INR57 for each tablet. The launch gives Natco an entry in the rapidly growing SGLT-2 segment that has mostly been dominated by global drug makers. However, for roughly a year, the segment has seen the entry of Indian drug maker Glenmark, which launched its versions of remogliflozin at a significantly lower price than MNC brands. According to information available, AstraZeneca has two patents on dapagliflozin in India, the first of which expires later this year in October and the other in 2023. There is no clarity on any injunction moves by AstraZeneca against Natco, since Indian courts are closed due to the continuing nationwide lockdown to control the spread of Covid-19.",ABBV,en,Economic Times India

Germany’s parliament took that message to heart as part of a package to fight the virus, extending powers to suspend patent rights, a tool last used in the country in 1949.Governments around the world are reviving rarely used legislation or pledging new measures to ensure that they have the drugs they need to battle the pandemic. Israel last month invoked an emergency patent-suspension clause in its 1967 code for the first time, allowing it to import a generic version of AbbVie Inc.’s Kaletra, which has shown signs of combating coronavirus.In the U.K., so-called Crown Use rules allow the government to suspend protections it would normally grant a patent holder. Those have been used just a handful of times since 1945, but that could change.“If there is a drug supply shortage, governments aren’t going to be squeamish about ordering companies to do what they think is necessary,” said James Tumbridge, a lawyer with Venner Shipley in London.",ABBV,en,Economic Times India

A Natco official confirmed its launch but refused to divulge more details. It is learnt that the Indian drug maker has already dispatched the drug in distribution channels. The Natco drug will cost at approximately INR 38000 per month as opposed to INR 4 lakh course of the innovator. A patient is expected to take 4 tablets each day.Sources informed ET that Pharmacyclics had filed for an injunction petition in Delhi High Court but no clear decision was handed out. Natco was directed to maintain data for its inventory and stocks sold.Natco's latest move is consistent with its earlier launches and challenging the patents held on anti-cancer drugs by multinational drug companies.",ABBV,en,The Economic Times India

The patient chart analysis revealed that TNF inhibitor cycling remains the most common switch pattern among RA patients, though has leveled off over the past year after steady decreases since 2016. Nevertheless, the percent of patients being switched from one TNF inhibitor to another drops with each line of biologic/JAK therapy, as rheumatologists are more inclined to prescribe an alternate mechanism agent in the second- or later-line setting. While the percent of patients being switched to a TNF inhibitor stands unchanged from the prior year, switches to JAK inhibitors have increased in popularity – likely at the expense of the IL-6 inhibitor class, which had been experiencing year over year gains in the switch- to segment up until the current year (reverting back to figures reported in 2016).",ABBV,en,Benzinga Feeds

Humira is a drug that featured prominently in my recent Dispatches investigation for Channel 4, Trump’s Plans for the NHS , which examined how a UK trade deal with the US after Brexit might affect the NHS. It was in this programme that a source with knowledge of the early stages of trade talks told us that discussions had taken place between British and US trade officials that were likely to affect the price the NHS pays for medicines such as Humira.

The medical cannabis marketplace is currently much more prevalent globally, even though the recreational sector thrives throughout the North American region. Nevertheless, recreational cannabis use is still allowed in countries such as the Netherlands , Spain , and even Colombia . Despite the worldwide use of cannabis, the industry remains heavily hindered by a lack of large-scale, clinical research and studies. This lack has led many countries to mistakenly assume that cannabis is simply a debilitating drug. Various government bodies are now demanding more clinical trial results in order to better understand the efficacy of cannabis and reverse the stigma that surrounds the plant. So far, research has concluded that the psychoactive effects are derived from the THC or tetrahydrocannabinol compound found within the cannabis plant.","ABT,ABBV",en,Benzinga

Furthermore, it was reported that 129 countries were cultivating cannabis. Predominantly, most countries which have adopted cannabis legislation have legalized the plant specifically for medical purposes. The recreational segment of the market still remains strictly enforced in almost every country, however. Nevertheless, the Latin American region was among the first to change the perspective of cannabis. Uruguay was the first country ever to legalize cannabis entirely, meaning users are allowed to freely consume cannabis for both medical and recreational applications. Moreover, other Latin American countries have moved to loosen regulations regarding cannabis as well. Countries such as Argentina , Chile , Colombia , and Brazil have all legalized medical cannabis, while some have also decriminalized cannabis, allowing for moderate personal consumption.","ABT,ABBV",en,Benzinga

Potentially incentivized by a new study on the monoclonal antibody therapy market, analysts recently projected a double-digit 10.5% CAGR by 2022, and revenues to touch $140 billion . Driving this surge is the development of new therapeutic drugs from Big Pharma giants such as AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE ), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE: TMO ), as well as from contract research organizations (CROs) such as ImmunoPrecise Antibodies Ltd. (TSXV: IPA ) (OTC: IPATF ). Working hand in hand, Big Pharma has been increasingly leaning on CROs to help take care of the drug development.

2019-01-25 07:30:10-05:00,"Stocks Rally After Shrugging Off Trade Concerns, Dismal German Data","It's a sea of green across global markets, which resumed their rally overnight with European stock and US equity futures following Asian peers higher, shrugging off softer numbers from tech giant Intel and weaker German IFO data, buoyed by strong earnings and optimism from some positive trade-related comments by U.S. officials ahead of next week’s meeting, while tech shares rallied. Gold and oil climbed, while the dollar hit session lows following news Trump advisor Roger Stone was arrested for witness tampering. European markets opened higher, led by automakers and tech stocks which rose 1.5% and 1%, respectively. Europe's STOXX 600 index hit its highest since Dec. 4, up 0.8% on the day . Trade optimism received a fresh boost of optimism after Bloomberg reported that a Chinese delegation including deputy ministers will arrive in Washington on Monday to prepare for high-level trade talks led by Vice Premier Liu He. The euro gained even as German business sentiment measured by the IFO Survey fell for the 5th month in a row to 99.1 its weakest level in almost three years, while the expectations component tumbled to the lowest level since 2012; confirming a recession in Europe's biggest economy is closer than most expect; core European sovereign bonds stabilized after rallying for most of the week.",ABBV,en,Zero Hedge
