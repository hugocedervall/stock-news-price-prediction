2020-07-02 09:43:20-05:00,Crew Crisis To Trigger Ship Detentions And Diversions,"Around 200,000 seafarers still can't get home due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. Expired and extended crew contracts are piling up. Now, some port inspectors are beginning to balk and detain arriving vessels. ""We are not just talking about a humanitarian crisis. This is turning into something that has a real impact on the global supply chain,"" warned Belal Ahmed, chairman of the International Maritime Employers Council (IMEC), during a webinar presented by Capital Link on Wednesday. More port detentions — and voyage diversions to facilitate crew changes and avoid detentions — would reduce effective ship capacity. Lower capacity would curtail shippers' ability to move cargo across the globe. It would also elevate spot rates, a positive for owners of ships that aren't detained or diverted. The ""freshness"" of crew contracts would become a competitive advantage for shipowners and a metric vetted by charterers. The billion-dollar question is: Which countries' port-state control (PSC) authorities will strictly enforce minimum manning standards and detain ships?",SEAS,en,Benzinga Feeds

As we explained at the time, the Fed needed to do this to unfreeze an increasingly broken Treasury market and to facilitate a relatively orderly unwind of highly leveraged UST positions that have likely reached loss risk limits with recent market volatility, which sparked an unprecedented VaR shock (as Cabana note, ""the dealer community could not facilitate the unwind of such trades since their balance sheets were full of duration + limited ability to expand them under current regulations).",SEAS,en,Zero Hedge
