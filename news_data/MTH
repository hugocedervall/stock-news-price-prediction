Each of these statistics points to different solutions for reducing buildings’ carbon footprint. Shifting heating from fossil fuels to electricity can cut direct emissions. More efficient building design, materials, and appliances can cut electricity consumption. And managing electricity use to match grid needs can help utilities control the costliest part of decarbonizing their systems — reducing reliance on dispatchable fossil-fueled power. The Department of Energy’s $65 million funding for “connected communities” projects announced last week is focused on all three parts of this equation. It builds on scores of projects across the country combining high efficiency, electrification, and distributed energy resources (DERs) like rooftop or community solar, battery and thermal energy storage, and electric vehicle charging.",MTH,en,Green Technology Media
