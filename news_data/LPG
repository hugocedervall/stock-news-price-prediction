America's liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) exports are also in the crosshairs. The global LPG trade rose 14% in 2019, to an all-time-high 109 million tons, with almost all of the seaborne volume evenly split between exports from the Middle East and U.S. Gulf. John Hadjipateras, CEO of Dorian LPG (NYSE: LPG ), said on his company's Feb. 5 quarterly call that ""it appears annual U.S. export volumes will surpass the Middle East for the first time in 2020."" But the world has dramatically changed since Hadjipateras made that statement. It now appears U.S. LPG exports will fall back and Middle East exports will rise. LPG market dynamics LPG is an associated-gas byproduct of the crude and natural gas drilling process and a byproduct of the crude-refining process. Propane and butane are the primary LPG cargoes.

Fuel oil sales edged 3.8 per cent lower in September to 525,000 tonnes.These downward trends negated the rise in cooking gas (LPG) and petrol demand.The sale of petrol rose 6.2 per cent to 2.37 million tonnes, but sale of jet fuel or ATF fell 1.6 per cent to 666,000 tonnes.LPG consumption surged 6 per cent to 2.18 million tonnes on the back of government's push for the use of cleaner fuel in household kitchens in rural areas in place of firewood to check pollution and safeguard the health of women.Kerosene, which is fast being replaced by LPG and natural gas as a cooking medium, saw demand fall almost 38 per cent to 176,000 tonnes.Petroleum coke consumption was however 18 per cent higher at 1.73 million tonnes.Meanwhile, Fitch Solutions revised downward its India oil demand forecast, reflecting a deteriorating macroeconomic backdrop and rising risks to growth.""We now forecast demand growth to average 3.8 per cent y-o-y over the three years to 2021, down from 4.6 per cent previously,"" it said, adding softening of Indian fuel demand adds to an increasingly bearish outlook for fuel demand globally.""We had previously flagged India as the outperformer, forecast to overtake China as the global engine for growth.",LPG,en,The Economic Times India

The panel has to submit report by July-end.The panel has the same experts who were in the committee that recently recommended policy reforms regarding the setting up of petrol pumps, one key measure being eliminating the condition of investing ?2,000 crore in the oil sector to obtain fuel retail license.The Terms of Reference of the expert committee on the marketing of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) include “review the existing structure of LPG marketing in the country and assess whether competition should be allowed in marketing of a controlled commodity which is deficient in the country,” a recent memo by the oil ministry said.The panel will also “assess the need, if any, to liberalise government policies to increase the participation of private sector in LPG marketing in the country.”Reliance serves about a million cooking gas customers across several states, which is tiny compared to country’s customer base of 26.5 million.",LPG,en,The Economic Times India
