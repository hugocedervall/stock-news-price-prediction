2020-05-27 09:18:59-05:00,Tencent's $70 billion investment plan in cloud computing will pit it against US providers,"Chinese tech giant Tencent unveiled a 5-year, 500 billion yuan ($70 billion) plan to invest in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity, according to Reuters. The move will help diversify Tencent's revenue streams, more than half of which came from online video games (35%) and social networks (23%) in the company's Q1 2020 earnings . Tencent's fintech and business services segment, which encompasses cloud services, made up 25% of revenue that quarter. The company's cloud operations are concentrated in China, where it captured 18% of the cloud infrastructure services spend, a distant second behind Alibaba Cloud, which captured 46%, according to Canalys estimates for Q4 2019. Tencent will increasingly go head-to-head against US-based cloud providers as it looks to capitalize its cloud investments in markets outside of China. US cloud providers generally don't compete in China, and Chinese cloud providers generally don't compete in the US. But outside of these markets — the two largest in the world in terms of cloud infrastructure revenues — both US- and China-based cloud providers have expanded their cloud infrastructure such that they compete head-to-head.",TLK,en,Business Insider
