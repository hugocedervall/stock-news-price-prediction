2020-02-13 10:05:32-05:00,"Coronavirus Fears Back On Big Earnings Day As Alibaba, PepsiCo, Nvidia All Report","Anyone who went to bed last night thinking the market’s coronavirus fears had faded got a rude awakening this morning. Stocks fell sharply overseas and U.S. futures plunged after China reported thousands more cases and a larger death toll. The bad news puts this week’s fast-paced rally into question as investors wondered if virus concerns might again quiet down the party Wall Street had been enjoying. We’ve talked about how the virus is going to be an overhang, and sadly, it still is. There’s nothing people can do except hunker down and, of course, watch their health. After fading earlier this week, fear meters like bonds, gold, and volatility came back into favor today. The 10-year yield slipped below 1.6%, the Cboe Volatility Index (INDEXCBOE: VXS) jumped above 15, and gold prices are firmer. Crude prices edged down toward $51 a barrel. A risk-off tone seems to be back in town. The travel and leisure sector might be in focus after two days of recovery for many of those stocks. For instance, yesterday saw gains for retailers whose shares had been beaten down by coronavirus.",PVH,en,Benzinga

Insider Inc. receives a commission from our affiliate partners when you buy through our links, but our reporting and recommendations are always independent and objective. I’ve worn bras for over a decade, but True&Co 's True Body collection has the only seamless bra I've tried that actually supports and lifts cup sizes of C-DDD without wires. They have a variety of styles in their True Body collection, but their V Neck Racerback, $58 is my favorite and ultimate weekday warrior. The True Body collection sold out seven times after debut, and every bra falls within the range of $44 - $64. Shop True&Co best-sellers directly , or take a detailed Fit Test here , which uses fit data from nearly 6 million women to make their designs smarter and recommendations more precise. Like most people who regularly navigate Facebook, I’ve grown a bit suspicious of all the ads chasing me. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve found really great buys that way — Mahabis slippers , Daily Harvest smoothies , Mott & Bow skinny jeans , and Oliberte leather boots come to mind — but there are at least a few companies hiding in that mix who might have a big social media following, but ultimately underdeliver on their promises of comfort, quality, or fit.",PVH,en,Business Insider
