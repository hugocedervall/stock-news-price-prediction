2020-02-06 10:47:00-05:00,Equinor: Floating Wind Farms a Natural Fit for Oil and Gas Companies,"The cost of floating wind farms is on a steeper decline than traditional offshore wind, making the emerging sector increasingly attractive to oil and gas companies, said Sebastian Bringsværd, head of floating wind development at Norwegian energy giant Equinor. After years of industry anticipation without a lot to show for it, the floating wind market is finally gaining momentum in a commercially meaningful way. The goal, Bringsværd said, is to scale floating projects up to a comparable level as traditional projects, which are often 500 megawatts or larger, taking advantage of offshore wind’s huge economies of scale. Just a few years ago that was an “ambitious” vision,” Bringsværd said. “Now I see that's very realistic.” Equinor, among Europe’s largest oil producers, carved out an early leadership position in the emerging floating wind sector, completing the industry’s first full-scale project several years ago, the 30-megawatt Hywind Scotland. ACS’ 50-megawatt Kincardine Bay floating project, also off the coast of Scotland, will go into operation later this year, setting a new industry benchmark.","AKR,AKER",en,Green Technology
