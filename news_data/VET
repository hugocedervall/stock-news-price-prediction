2020-08-12 11:14:00-05:00,Global Enterprises Embrace Public Blockchains as Technology Matures,"More enterprises are using public blockchains as the space matures, but what does this mean for private blockchain adoption? Some of the billion-dollar businesses across the globe have been embracing blockchain technology to efficiently share sensitive data between multiple parties across a single network. While the concept is welcome, early adopters of blockchain technology have often found themselves lured toward private networks due to security concerns and a greater need for control. Yet, as the blockchain space continues to mature, there has been a shift in the enterprise mindset. While “enterprise blockchain” was once defined by private networks, the blockchain space is entering a new era, one that is bound to be dominated by public blockchain adoption. Author and advisor Alex Tapscott told Cointelegraph that the future of enterprise adoption will be built on public blockchains: “At the beginning of the blockchain revolution, a lot of enterprises were keen to experiment with blockchain but questioned the resiliency, privacy and ability to customize public blockchains.",VET,en,Cointelegraph
