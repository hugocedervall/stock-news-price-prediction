2020-07-14 14:10:00-05:00,Georgia Trucking Group: In-Person Annual Meeting Led To No COVID Infections,"The Georgia Motor Trucking Association (GMTA) did something last month that few organizations have attempted since March: It met in person. (Photo: GMTA) Gathering at the Ritz Carlton in Amelia Island, Florida, about 300 people came for the group's annual meeting. That's down from a usual number that might hit 600 but it's a lot more than zero, which has been the norm across all sectors since the pandemic first took hold in March. And according to Ed Crowell, the president, and CEO of the GMTA, the number of COVID-19 cases reported back to the organization from the June 19-22 meeting remains at zero. Given that the COVID-19 virus has a two-week incubation period, it's likely the number will stay there. But that doesn't mean holding the meeting was a breeze. In an interview with FreightWaves, Crowell said the organization began working with the Ritz Carlton in February on how the GMTA could pull off a socially distanced meeting. ""In some respects, it wasn't easy,"" Crowell said. ""But it's helped to have good data to help make the choice."" According to a summary of the meeting sent by the GMTA to other associations, an April survey of members indicated 90%-plus support for an in-person meeting.",GMTA,en,Benzinga Feeds

These banks believed railcars carrying coal, grain, and other commodities were going to be highly profitable but have recently turned out to be a major headache as many cars are now in storage because of new regulations and demand woes brought on by fluctuating commodity markets. David Nahass, president of Railroad Financial Corp., which provides advisory services to railroad firms, told The Wall Street Journa l that ""the industry is suffering, there are no two ways about it. Lease rates are down, and there's not a source of hope about when it will start to improve."" The Journal, citing the Association of American Railroads (AAR), said about 400,000 railcars currently sit in storage with no use at all, and many are bank-owned. CIT estimated railcar lease rates fell 10% to 15% in 2019 over the prior year.",GMTA,en,Zero Hedge
