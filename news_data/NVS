In your recent report on the pharma industry, you have said that it has the size and capability to grow to $100 billion. What is needed to scale up to that level?I will give you a context before I get into the details of how we will reach $100 billion. The global pharma industry is around $1.3 trillion and within that, generics is around $270 billion and India accounts for 3% of the global pharma sector which is at $40 billion today. We are a very large exporting organisation, close to 19-20 billion of our industry’s output is exported and 40% of the export is predominately going to the US and some to the UK and other countries like South Africa. If you consider the patents that would expire over the next four to five years, roughly around $200 billion of generics would be coming into the market, which therefore makes global generics market move from $270 billion to $450 billion and that is a significant opportunity for the India market because we are a large exporting industry.",NVS,en,Economic Times India

Since the first human genome was sequenced in 2003, the genetic testing market has evolved rapidly alongside consumers' interest in how their genetic makeup affects their health. The human genome was sequenced — or read in its entirety — for the first time in 2003 after more than 20 years of work and nearly $5 billion was put into the National Institutes of Health's (NIH's) Human Genome Project — which marked a huge step in helping scientists and medical researchers understand how genes and gene interactions impact disease development and progression. In the ensuing decades, genetic information catapulted into mainstream healthcare, driven largely by the rapid decline in cost for DNA sequencing technology.","NVTA,NVS",en,Business Insider

Switzerland is easing up on the lockdown but what the new normal looks like for big companies is still a work in progress. Last week, the Swiss government announced it was taking its foot off the brakes and re-opening the economy on the condition that we all behave ourselves.

House lawmakers are discussing a plan that could work to curb high drug prices. Some of the proposals include allowing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate with pharma companies on the prices of drugs covered by Medicare. If no agreement were reached, the decision would rest with the Government Accountability Office, which is given the prerogative to fix prices based on the median price of a drug in other countries. Pharma executives are pushing back, reasoning that the prevailing prices are justified given the billions of dollars invested in R&D. Here's a look at five of the most expensive drugs in the U.S. 1.

From large-cap pharma to tiny biotechs, many companies are trying to make a name for themselves in gene therapy — a novel approach to treating or preventing diseases using genes. Spark Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: ONCE )'s Luxturna is the only FDA-approved proper gene therapy and is indicated to treat adults and children with inherited retinal disorder that could lead to vision loss. Novartis AG (NYSE: NVS )'s Kymriah and Gilead Sciences, Inc (NASDAQ: GILD )'s Yescarta, though mentioned as gene therapy products, are in fact cell therapy products that use the body's own T-cells to fight cancer. The excitement is building, as the FDA is set to give its verdict on a second gene therapy product sponsored by Novartis. Zolgensma is being evaluated for spinal muscular dystrophy — or SMA — Type 1.

In five years, Perlara quickly vaulted to success, from a slot in Y Combinator to investments from drug giant Novartis and the billionaire Mark Cuban. But when things went south, Perlstein was forced to wind down the business. He told Business Insider about how he built a biotech from scratch as a first-time entrepreneur, and what went wrong. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. Ethan Perlstein never meant to become an entrepreneur. ""I became a biotech entrepreneur out of necessity,"" he says. The Harvard- and Princeton-trained scientist was following a path to academia when, by his own telling, academia wouldn't have him. So the 39-year-old chose to start his own biotech company, which he likes to joke is much safer and not at all risky. In 2014, Perlstein started Perlara , basing it in Oakland, California.

Mark Meadows (R-NC) following a heated exchange during Cohen's Wednesday testimony in front of the House Oversight Committee. Meadows pressed Cohen over his apparent failure to list contracts with foreign companies that paid him for access to the Trump administration, including Novartis, which paid Cohen $1.2 million to act as a consultant on the Trump administration, as well as $150,000 from South Korea's Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) and a payment from Kazakhstan BTA bank. Cohen claimed that since the Meadows: ""I'm going to back to the question I asked before with regards to your false statement that you submitted to Congress. On here it was very clear that it asks for contracts with foreign entities over the last two years. Have you had any foreign contracts with foreign entities whether it's Novartis or the Korean Airline or Kazakhstan BTA bank?

2019-01-26 14:45:00-05:00,Corcept Therapeutics: The Company That Perfectly Explains The Health Care Crisis,"Authored by Roddy Boyd via Southern Investigative Reporting Foundation, If someone wanted to use a Venn diagram to illustrate what is wrong with the U.S. health care system, picking the different sets would be easy: Price gouging, abuse of loopholes, hidden risks to patients, baffling regulatory decisions, marginal efficacies and the use of doctor payments to stimulate drug sales would be some logical choices. And a case in point would be Corcept Therapeutics, a specialty pharmaceutical company based in Menlo Park, California, and the apparent union of all things expensive and opaque. So how did Corcept, a small company with just one drug aimed at treating a tiny population of patients with a rare pituitary disorder, wind up there? Corcept has managed to make handsome profits by quietly yet efficiently exploiting gaps in the nation’s health care regulatory framework. And its sole drug is none other than the storied mifepristone , better known as the abortion pill. While Roussel-Uclaf developed mifepristone in France in 1980, it became famous in the U.S. in 2000 when the Food and Drug Administration ruled that doctors could prescribe it to induce an abortion; it was sold as RU-486.",NVS,en,Zero Hedge
