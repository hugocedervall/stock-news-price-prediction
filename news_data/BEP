2020-11-24 09:56:00-05:00,Plug Power Raises $1B for US Green Hydrogen Infrastructure Build-Out,"Plug Power has raised about $1 billion in a bought equity transaction to fund its plan to build what could be the first U.S-wide network of green hydrogen production facilities to supply fuel cell-powered vehicles, including its own, with carbon-free fuel. The Latham, N.Y.-based company, already the country’s largest user of hydrogen to fuel forklifts and other working vehicles using its fuel cells, also intends to build a “ gigafactory ” to expand production of fuel cells and electrolyzers, spurring a phone call last week from U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y., to the company asking it to site the factory in his home state. Tuesday’s sale of about 43.7 million shares via an underwriting agreement with Morgan Stanley brings Plug Power’s total cash post-closing balance to $1.7 billion. “The capital raise uniquely positions Plug Power to execute and accelerate on its green hydrogen strategy as well as other strategic growth initiatives,” the company said in a prepared statement. “We plan to build five green hydrogen stations across North America, using 100 tons of hydrogen a day.",BEP,en,Green Technology Media
