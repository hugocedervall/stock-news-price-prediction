Many SMBs are on the brink of closing permanently in the wake of the pandemic. The crisis forced many to temporarily close and has caused drops in demand as consumers deal with financial difficulties and follow social distancing guidelines. The sudden drop in earnings, which may continue if pandemic conditions don't improve soon, could lead to wide-scale small-business closures in the coming months, and medium-sized businesses may be facing similar risks since the prolonged nature of the crisis is likely cutting into any additional resources and funds they have access to. By helping SMBs survive the crisis, point-of-sale (POS) solution providers will preserve their client bases and strengthen their appeal to prospective customers. Many SMBs already had some form of POS system in order to accept payments. But now they may also need tools that help them digitize their business, adjust their operations, and trim their costs for post-pandemic survival.",V,en,Business Insider

From market cap valuation to risk assessment, here's what you need to know about large-cap stocks. What is market capitalization? But first, a quick primer.

Die Prüfung soll von der britischen Aufsichtsbehörde für Arzneimittel durchgeführt werden. Zuvor waren Zweifel am Design der klinischen Studien und der hohen Wirksamkeit des Impfstoffs aufgekommen. Der schwedisch-britische Konzern plant daher zusätzliche Untersuchungen. Sie sollen die Daten «bereits vorhandener Studien ergänzen», teilte eine Sprecherin von Astrazeneca der Deutschen Presse-Agentur in London mit, ohne Details zu nennen.

Dabei denkt sie eigenen Aussagen zufolge auch an einen bestimmten Rat zurück . ""Meine Mutter hat mir seit meiner Kindheit gesagt: 'Du bist die, mit denen du dich umgibst. Achte darauf, dass du von Menschen umgeben bist, die auch die besten Versionen ihrer selbst sein wollen und auch ein gutes gemeinsames Ziel für alle haben, und nicht nur für sich selbst'."" Sie habe sich mit Freunden unterhalten, die bereits eine Scheidung durchgemacht hätten, erzählte Clarkson davor in der Sunday Today -Show.

In a dramatic move, Ethereum community members deposited a huge chunk, more than 40% of all ETH required to reach the threshold to trigger ETH 2.0. With an increase of 279% in deposits in just one day, the ETH community did the deed a day before and confirmed the launch of Phase 0 on December 1st as scheduled. Interestingly, the price of ETH moved in the exact direction as of the staked Ether, as per Crypto Quant. The price of ETH was just under $400 when the deposit contract for Beacon Chain was released to the public. And yesterday, ETH hit $600, going as far as $621. Now that ETH 2.0 is officially coming in a week and BTC price is making some moves today, ETH price is retreating but still around $600. Along with this positive price action, Perpetual Swaps Open Interest also reached a new yearly high of $1.69b, both in USD terms and Ether terms.

The market for these so-called 'challenger banks' has exploded in recent years as customers are drawn to seamless account openings and optimized user experiences on their apps and websites. The majority of these fintechs target those who are underbanked, and rely on usage of their debit cards to make money off interchange. But fellow startup HMBradley has a different business model. ""Our thesis going in was that we don't swipe our debit cards all that often, and we don't think the customer base that we're focusing on does either,"" Zach Bruhnke, cofounder and CEO of HMBradley, told Business Insider.

Im Prozess von Herzogin Meghan gegen Associated Newspapers, den Herausgeber der Mail on Sunday , scheint die 39-Jährige immer schlechtere Karten zu haben. Meghan Markle, die Herzogin von Sussex, hat das britische Blatt verklagt, weil dieses im Jahr 2019 Auszüge aus einem privaten handgeschriebenen Brief Meghans an ihren Vater Thomas Markle veröffentlichte. Harrys Ehefrau und ihr juristisches Team sehen darin einen Verstoß gegen das Datenschutz- und Urheberrechtsgesetz. Der Inhalt des Briefes sei ""privat und vertraulich"" gewesen. Meghan habe darin ihre ""tiefsten und privatesten Gedanken"", geteilt. Harrys Frau fordert zudem Schadensersatz wegen Missbrauchs privater Informationen. Doch nun stellt sich offenbar die Frage, ob Meghan besagten Brief überhaupt selbst verfasst hat. Hat Meghan den Brief an ihren Vater gar nicht selbst verfasst?

The owner of a Missouri-based CBD chain expressed relief this week after a federal judge ruled he could continue pursuing unjust enrichment and defamation claims against Visa, which he has accused of “terrorizing” his business. Among other claims, he says the credit card giant arbitrarily placed him on a transaction blacklist. David Palatnik, the owner of MNG 2005 Inc., initially filed the suit two years ago against Visa, along with JPMorgan Chase, its subsidiary Paymentech LLC, and G2 Web Services. The suit alleges that Visa withheld $66,000 in payments, fined MNG $25,000, and cut off transactions involving the business after wrongly determining that it was involved in illegal activities. The defendants had filed several motions to have the claims dismissed, but U.S. District Judge John A. Ross ruled Monday that the CBD chain can sue Visa for unjust enrichment and defamation. He dismissed antitrust claims, however, and ruled that a contract between MNG and Chase and Paymentech limits MNG to just breach of contract claims against those companies.",V,en,Benzinga

""Bitcoin has failed as means of payment"" is one of the prevalent criticisms of Bitcoin ( BTC ) that Fidelity Digital Assets is seeking to rebut. In a blog post published on Nov. 13, the firm took on six “persistent” criticisms, including Bitcoin's volatility, environmental wastefulness and use in illicit activities. Regarding the coin's purported failure as a means of payment for everyday transactions, Fidelity's argument is that this criticism fails to understand Bitcoin's core purpose. The currency is outperformed, Fidelity accepts, by conventional payment rails like Visa, Mastercard and PayPal, all of which can offer higher throughput. However, Bitcoin has been designed with other priorities in mind, including “perfect scarcity,” Fidelity argues. “Bitcoin makes deliberate trade-offs, such as limited and expensive capacity, to offer core properties such as decentralization and immutability. Given its high settlement assurances, Bitcoin optimizes its limited capacity for settling transactions that aren’t well served by traditional rails.” While the coin is, in theory, viable as a payment tool, its limitations mean that everyday use is not necessarily the end goal for the asset.",V,en,Cointelegraph

2020-11-08 03:00:00-05:00,The cryptocurrency sector is overflowing with dead projects,"Blockchain technology is just a tool that solves a problem, it cannot be the goal of the entire project. In 2017, when everything concerned with cryptocurrency and blockchain still looked fresh and interesting, it seemed that there would be no day without a new “revolutionary” project or idea. Decentralized financial system, decentralized torrent tracker, decentralized office documentation system. Decentralized, decentralized, decentralized. The overuse of terms like “transparent,” “distributed” and “blockchain-based” soon made most press papers look generic. The closer we got to the peak of the Bitcoin price at the end of 2017, the more absurd the names of new projects became: “Ethereum-based payment system for slaughterhouse industry workers,” “decentralized blockchain-based dwarf horse breeding platform,” “peer-to-peer personal banking service for divorced blind people,” and so on. Who would ever need any of that, one might ask. Well, in many cases, nobody. Of the several thousand cryptocurrencies launched since the spread of blockchain technology, only about 30 are currently of any investment interest .",V,en,Cointelegraph

Sollte sich «Disco» nach der Veröffentlichung an die Spitze der britischen Charts setzen, hätte der Megastar in seiner Wahlheimat in fünf aufeinanderfolgenden Jahrzehnten jeweils ein Nummer-eins-Album veröffentlicht. Das ist bisher noch keiner Solo-Künstlerin im Mutterland des Pop geglückt. «Ich bin froh, dass mir das nicht bewusst war, als ich das Album gemacht habe», sagt die 52-Jährige im Zoom-Gespräch mit der Deutschen Presse-Agentur, «denn dann hätte ich mich unter Druck gesetzt gefühlt. Ich versuche auch jetzt nicht, darüber nachzudenken. Aber klar, wenn ich das schaffen könnte, wäre das unglaublich.» Was auf ihrer mittlerweile 15. Platte draufsteht, das ist eben einfach auch drin. Mit «Disco» schlägt Australiens Pop-Export Nummer eins einen Bogen über den Dancefloor-Sound ihrer eigenen Karriere - und weit darüber hinaus. Besonders raffiniert ist ihre Single «Say Something». Kylies melodisch-klarer Gesang bietet einen feinen Kontrapunkt zu knirschenden Gitarrenlicks, anstachelndem Funk-Beat und massigen Chor-Kaskaden.",V,de,Westfalen-Blatt

Bei einer Veranstaltung zum Gedenken an das Attentat hat Israels Staatspräsident gesagt, dass der „systemische Schaden“ von damals bis in die Gegenwart anhalte. Wegen des beweglichen jüdischen Kalenders hat man am vorigen Donnerstag Rabins gedacht. Auch heute, so das Staatsoberhaupt, sei Israel politisch gespalten, es gebe Mordaufrufe gegen Bürger und Politiker. Rivlin hat zur Pflicht gemahnt, den Bruch zu reparieren. Ob sich sein Appell in erster Linie an den Regierungschef gerichtet hat? Auch das Parlament, die Knesset, hat an die Tat erinnert – mit einer Sondersitzung. Ministerpräsident Benjamin Netanjahu hat dazu aufgerufen, Gewalt von allen Seiten zu verurteilen, und beklagt, dass es weiterhin Aufrufe gebe, ihn und seine Familie zu ermorden, „und fast niemand sagt etwas dazu“. Seine politischen Gegner wollen dem Premier diese Form des Selbstmitleids nicht so einfach durchgehen lassen.

Once seen as scrappy disruptors, fintechs have established themselves as a serious threat. For a majority of Americans, these consumer apps have become a key part of their financial lives. From peer-to-peer transfers to new forms of credit and no-fee bank accounts, fintechs run the gamut of personal-finance products. But the startup revolution hasn't occurred entirely independently. Fintechs still need banks, or at the very least, the data stored inside them. With many of their customers maintaining accounts at traditional financial firms, fintechs need to be able to connect and share information with their much larger peers.

Der Genetiker Josef Penninger hofft – „wenn alles gut geht“ –, dass bis Weihnachten Daten zu seinem in Wien entwickelten Medikamentenkandidaten APN01 gegen Covid-19 vorliegen. „Die Idee ist, mit unserem Enzym APN01 für das Virus die Tür in die Zelle zu blockieren und gleichzeitig die Organe zu schützen“, sagte er Montag bei einer Veranstaltung der Pharmig (Verband der pharmazeutischen Industrie). „Das ist der rationalste Ansatz überhaupt.“ Patienten in Österreich, Deutschland, Dänemark und Russland mit einem schweren Krankheitsverlauf werden derzeit in eine Studie aufgenommen, in zwei bis drei Wochen soll die notwendige Patientenzahl erreicht sein. Nach der Therapie müssen die Patienten (100 erhalten den Wirkstoff, 100 ein Placebo) noch vier Wochen beobachtet werden. „Es hilft keinem, schlechte Studien schnell in die Öffentlichkeit hinauszuwerfen.“ Bei einer guten Datenlage werde die Firma Apeiron Biologics anschließend um eine Schnellzulassung in der EU ansuchen. „Die Zukunft wird wahrscheinlich die Kombination von zwei oder drei Medikamenten sein, die alle an anderen Stellen ansetzen“, sagte Penninger vor der Gesellschaft der Ärzte in Wien. ""So ähnlich wie bei HIV."" ""15 Jahre hat sich niemand interessiert"" Die Grundlagen für sein Präparat hatte ein Team um Penninger vor rund 15 Jahren entwickelt, nach dem Auftreten des SARS-1-Virus. „15 Jahre lang hat sich niemand dafür interessiert, jetzt werden unsere Arbeiten tausendfach zitiert.“ Penninger und sein Team haben das Enzym ACE2 mitentdeckt, welches das neue Coronavirus als Eintrittspforte in die Zellen benötigt.",V,de,KURIER Medienhaus

The bullish calls this past week included FAANG stocks and other blue chips. A financial giant and merging chip stocks were among the week's bearish calls. The big three U.S. indexes ended another wild week 5% or more lower due to stalled stimulus talks , a resurging pandemic and uncertainty around the upcoming election, which prompted one big retailer to prepare for civil unrest.

2020-10-30 14:32:00-05:00,The 6 best credit cards for bad credit in November 2020,"Summary List Placement Having a low credit score makes it harder to get approved for a new credit card and other types of loans, and it means that when you do get approved for, say, a mortgage, you'll generally get less-favorable terms like the highest variable interest rates. A bad credit score is defined as anything below 580, according to the FICO scoring model, and anything below 601 according to VantageScore. If you currently find yourself in this credit score range, you probably won't get approved for popular rewards cards like the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card , but you do have some credit card options. Secured credit cards are particularly easy to get approved for, because you put up a cash deposit as collateral to get started, and there are also non-secured cards tailored to those looking to repair or build their credit. Using a card responsibly will help boost your credit over time, since keeping your credit utilization low and making on-time payments are the two biggest factors that determine your credit score .","V,USD",en,Business Insider

This represents a rebound from the 10% YoY decrease in payments volume Visa reported in its fiscal Q3 2020 (ended June 30, 2020), though the firm is still behind the 9% YoY boost it posted for its fiscal Q4 2019 (ended September 30, 2019), as the pandemic has taken a toll on the firm. Visa's recovery may be related to the relaxation of social distancing requirements in various markets. And since its US payments volume grew 7% YoY in its fiscal Q4 2020 and was up 9% YoY in October through October 21, per CFO Vasant Prabhu on the company's earnings call , Visa could be on track to improve further in future quarters. Visa needs its performance to continue rising because all of its revenue drivers are still well behind their prepandemic performance levels.

Payments firms have introduced buy buttons to streamline the online checkout process, but so many have done so that it can have the opposite effect. This led companies to introduce buy buttons so consumers could skip the cumbersome, labor-intensive steps required to input contact and payment information online, and to allow them to shop online more freely. But the array of options has become overwhelming. Firms such as Mastercard, Visa, Apple, Amazon, Walmart, point-of-sale (POS) financing providers, and many more have developed buy buttons for their payment methods.

While its big brother, the Platinum Card® from American Express , often gets all the hype for premium travel rewards, and the American Express® Green Card has a lower annual fee, the Amex Gold Card comes with some great rewards and potentially useful statement credits that make it worth considering — especially if you like to eat out. The Amex Gold Card comes in a sleek metallic finish, but it's more than just good looks. It offers up to 4 points per dollar on popular categories. In fact, depending on your spending habits, it may even be more valuable to you than the ultra-premium Platinum Card® from American Express . That's because the Amex Gold Card earns 4x points at restaurants worldwide and 4x points on up to $25,000 spent at US supermarkets each calendar year (then 1x).

Zum Auftakt im Mordprozess um einen Aufsehen erregenden Münchner Vermisstenfall hat der Angeklagte alle Vorwürfe gegen ihn bestritten. Die Staatsanwaltschaft geht davon aus, dass er seine Frau im Juli vergangenen Jahres im Streit getötet und danach auch seine Stieftochter umgebracht hat, um die Tat zu verschleiern. Von den Frauen fehlt seit dem 13. Juli 2019 jede Spur. Der Mann ist wegen Totschlags und Mordes angeklagt. Der 45-Jährige bestreitet vor Gericht, mit dem Verschwinden der «Mädchen», wie er Frau und Stieftochter nennt, etwas zu tun zu haben. «Das, was mir vorgeworfen wird, dazu habe ich überhaupt keinen Bezug», sagt er - mit Hilfe eines Dolmetschers. «Außerdem gehe ich davon aus, dass die Mädchen immer noch leben - zumindest meine Frau.» Darum stört er sich auch daran, dass er in der Anklageschrift als «verwitwet» bezeichnet wird.

After his father suffered a heart attack in 2017, Cohen made a series of tough calls to spend more time with him: scrapping plans to take Chewy public, selling the company for $3.4 billion, and resigning as CEO the following year. Cohen broke with convention again by investing the vast majority of his wealth in two stocks , Apple and Wells Fargo, and later placing a contrarian bet on ailing video-game retailer GameStop. The entrepreneur attributes his independent streak to the ""two biggest influences on my professional life"": his father, Ted Cohen, who passed away last December, and Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO. ""Something critical that I learned from my dad and Warren Buffett was the ability to separate myself from the herd and think independently,"" Cohen told Business Insider this week. The pair's teachings allow him to ""block out the noise, develop my own point of view, and not be influenced by daily headlines or the consensus or what's in style."" For example, many people initially doubted Chewy would be able to ship 30-pound bags of pet food to customers and make any money. ""In the early years, few investors thought Chewy was a good idea,"" Cohen said. ""I struck out raising capital over 100 times."" Ignoring the skeptics, as well as avoiding distractions and saying ""no"" to all but the best opportunities, enabled Cohen to focus on the things most critical to Chewy's success: competitive prices, compelling products, fast shipping, and personalized customer service.",V,en,Business Insider

Many SMBs are on the brink of closing permanently in the wake of the pandemic. The crisis forced many to temporarily close and has caused drops in demand as consumers deal with financial difficulties and follow social distancing guidelines. The sudden drop in earnings, which may continue if pandemic conditions don't improve soon, could lead to wide-scale small-business closures in the coming months, and medium-sized businesses may be facing similar risks since the prolonged nature of the crisis is likely cutting into any additional resources and funds they have access to. By helping SMBs survive the crisis, point-of-sale (POS) solution providers will preserve their client bases and strengthen their appeal to prospective customers.

After all, one reason investors love tech stocks is that they're remarkably efficient at making tons of money. But is there such a thing as too much of a good thing? Fund manager David Dudding of Columbia Threadneedle Investments says that sometimes, fantastic profit margins are a warning sign. While he's naturally looking for profitable companies and has substantial investments in tech, he says he wants to see companies that are planning ahead. ""We don't want to see margins sort of going through the roof, because maybe that's an example of companies taking too much profit in the short term,"" he said. ""What we like are companies [where] maybe the margins go up a little bit every year, but not as much as they could do."" Dudding says it's often wiser for companies to plow money back into advertising, product development, and other areas that will improve their businesses over the longer term. ""We quite like looking at things like R&D as a percentage of sales or advertising and promotion as a percentage of sales,"" he told Business Insider in an exclusive interview.",V,en,Business Insider

In just four years, it accounts for more than half of digital retail payments — debit and credit cards clock around one billion transactions a month.While UPI has democratised digital payments, the ecosystem — UPI apps and banks — hasn’t reaped its due benefits. GoI’s continuous interference has made the growth of digital payments susceptible to uncertainty. Earlier this year, GoI mandated that merchants or sellers could not be charged any fees — merchant discount rate (MDR) —for accepting payments through UPI or RuPay cards. This fee is shared between the banks and the UPI apps. The business model for credit card companies is built on MDR, as merchants are charged for accepting credit cards.To make some money on UPI transactions, some private banks recently began charging for UPI transactions beyond a prescribed limit.",V,en,Economic Times India

Credit Karma, the credit-score monitoring fintech, is following suit with the launch of its first checking account, which the company announced Tuesday. The startup has historically focused on the debt side of consumer finance, offering free credit scores and recommendations for loans. But last year, Credit Karma launched its first-ever financial product, a savings account . And now, it's adding checking accounts, building its reach on the asset side of consumers' financial lives. The checking and savings accounts will be offered through a new platform, Credit Karma Money. Credit Karma's checking product won't have any fees like overdraft or minimum balance charges. While fintechs have mostly shied away from such fees, large national banks rely on them for revenue. In 2019, big banks in the US (those with more than $1 billion in assets) charged consumers over $11 billion in overdraft fees .",V,en,Business Insider

Der Autor dieser Zeilen ist kein Fan des Opernballes und hat das – auch an dieser Stelle – schon mehrfach geäußert.

Weil man neugierig war, wie er sich unter dem neuen Staatsoperndirektor Bogdan Roščić verändern würde; weil der Opernball – und sei es auch nur als Fernsehevent – zum gesellschaftlichen Leben in der Narrenzeit dazugehört; weil er generell als Symbol für den Fasching steht und seine Nichtaustragung auch bedeutet: Schluss mit lustig; weil er zu jenen vordergründigen Belanglosigkeiten zählt, die man erst vermisst, wenn es sie nicht mehr gibt; weil er der Oper jedes Jahr einen schönen Reingewinn und der partizipierenden Wirtschaft einen hohen Umsatz beschert hat; weil er erst in viereinhalb Monaten stattgefunden hätte, die nunmehrige Absage also das Eingeständnis mit sich bringt, dass uns das depperte Virus tatsächlich noch ziemlich lange Restriktionen bescheren wird; weil, weil, weil … Man darf davon ausgehen, dass es sich die Regierung mit diesem Schritt nicht leicht gemacht hat.",V,de,KURIER Medienhaus

NFX said on Tuesday it's hired 27-year-old operator Morgan Beller as a general partner, joining James Currier, Pete Flint, and Gigi Levy-Weiss at the seed-stage venture capital firm. Beller is best known for her time at Facebook, as the person who convinced the social network to make its own currency. Libra was announced in 2019 and would have let people make payments on Facebook's apps using a new digital currency built with blockchain technology and governed by a consortium of big companies. While the idea was at first met with enthusiasm and big-name partnerships, as Facebook faced one privacy scandal after another, the project suffered a major setback when it came under scrutiny from lawmakers. And then MasterCard, Visa, and eBay cut ties to the oversight group. By March , the project was radically altered to be less about creating a new currency and more about allowing Facebook to work with existing government-backed currencies.",V,en,Business Insider

Die wichtigste Frage war deshalb: Geht Livemusik unter Corona-Bedingungen überhaupt und macht das eigentlich noch Spaß? Der Chef des Festivals hat nun nach vier Tagen ein positives Fazit gezogen. «Ich bin schon zufrieden. Das meiste hat ganz gut geklappt», sagte Alexander Schulz am Sonntag der Deutschen Presse-Agentur in Hamburg. Das pandemiegerechte Festival habe zudem weitgehend mit dem Vorurteil aufräumen können, dass solche Veranstaltungen per se Superspreader-Events sind. «Livemusik-Veranstaltungen sind nicht gefährlicher als Bahnfahren», so Schulz weiter. Auch Ex-Spice-Girl Melanie C hatte am Samstagabend über die pandemiegerechte Version des Festivals gesagt: «Es ist unglaublich, dass es möglich war, trotzdem weiterzumachen. (…) Ich fühlte mich sehr sicher die ganze Zeit.» Einbahnstraßen-System, rund 600 Desinfektionsmittelspender an den Spielorten, akkurate Kontaktdateneingabe an den Ein- und Ausgängen, Sitzplätze an allen Spielorten und stets eineinhalb Meter Abstand - die Macher achteten sehr penibel auf die Einhaltung der Corona-Regeln. «Da waren wir wirklich sehr, sehr sorgfältig, und es gab Lob nicht nur von den Ämtern und Behörden, sondern sogar von den Besuchern», so Schulz.",V,de,Westfalen-Blatt

Mit ""Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2"" bringen Activision und Vicarious Visions gleich zwei echte Spiele-Klassiker zurück auf die Konsolen und den PC. Die Originale ""Tony Hawk’s Skateboarding"" und ""Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2"" erschienen 1999 und 2000 und erfreuten sich einer riesigen Fan-Gemeinde. Das letzte Spiel der Tony-Hawk-Reihe erschien 2015 als ""Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 5"". Nun das Comeback der beliebtesten Spiele als remasterte Version. Die bessere Grafik im Vergleich zu den ersten Editionen macht das Spiel für Hawks noch echter: ""Wenn ich meinen Charakter fallen sehe, fühlt es sich viel realer an. Ich zucke mehr zusammen, wenn ich die Verletzungen sehe"", scherzte er. In den 80er Jahren begann Hawks Karriere, in der er elf Weltmeistertitel holte. 1998 wurde das erste Videospiel mit Hawk als Figur veröffentlicht.",V,de,Volksstimme

Experten betonten gleichzeitig, dass insbesondere die Anwender mit einem iPhone gleichzeitig auch die aktuellste Version 13.7 des Betriebssystems iOS installieren sollten. Apple habe in den vergangenen Wochen die technische Schnittstelle (API) erheblich verbessert. Auf den Android-Smartphones wird die API über die sogenannten Google Play Services aktualisiert, ohne dass die Anwender aktiv werden müssen. Die Aktualisierung der RKI-App muss aber auch von Android-Anwendern angestoßen werden. Die neue App bessert nicht nur Fehler nach, sondern stellt neue und erweiterte Funktionen zur Verfügung.

In drei Ländern hat er schon seit der Geburt gelebt. Archie, der am 6. Mai ein Jahr alt wurde, trägt keinen Adelstitel. ""Er wird Master Archie genannt"", sagte eine Sprecherin nach seiner Geburt. ""Master"" ist im englischen Sprachgebrauch die vornehme Anrede für ein Kind. Bei den Buchmachern war zuvor vor allem auf Namen wie Alexander, Arthur, Albert, James und Philip gewettet worden. Der Name Archie galt hingegen als Überraschung in Großbritannien. Wie Omid Scobie und Carolyn Durand , die Autoren der neuen unautorisierten Biografie ""Finding Freedom"", behaupten, hätte Archie auch beinahe - ein bisschen - anders geheißen.

In its biggest shakeup in years , the elite index of 30 blue-chip stocks swapped out three of its components for new mega-cap names. And this reconstituted group of Dow Jones stocks began trading on Aug. 31. It's not unusual for the keepers of the Dow – S&P Dow Jones Indices – to change the average's makeup. One-off changes over the past few years include Apple's ( AAPL ) replacement of AT&T ( T ) in 2015, and Walgreens Boots Alliance's ( WBA ) replacement of General Electric ( GE ) in 2018. But the latest change is the largest multi-component swap since 2013, when Goldman Sachs ( GS ), Nike ( NKE ) and Visa ( V ) replaced Alcoa ( AA ), Bank of America ( BAC ) and Hewlett-Packard. With the blue-chip barometer sporting a fresh new look, it's a good time to review analysts' bull and bear cases on all 30 Dow stocks. To that end, we've sorted the Dow by analysts' average recommendation, from worst to first, using data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.",V,en,Kiplinger Washington Editors

The question is somewhat problematic because blockchain is an infrastructure, operating in the background out of sight that runs across multiple industries and domains. In an effort to shed some light on this point at issue, Cointegraph Magazine informally surveyed industry thought leaders to complete this sentence, We will know blockchain has gone mainstream when _______ Michael Peshkam, executive in residence at European business school INSEAD, told Cointelegraph Magazine, that there were over 50 million Blockchain wallet users at the end of June 2020. Traditionally this is the number of users [needed] to accept that a technology has gone mainstream.

In lieu of buying checkout hardware, merchants could use devices like smartphones to accept payments in the future. MagicCube built the card industry-backed security needed for widespread adoption. Earlier this year, Apple acquired Mobeewave, another fintech that turns smartphones into payment terminals. MagicCube has raised over $12 million to date from investors including Bold Capital, Epic Ventures, and the Sony Innovation Fund. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories .

Inside any point-of-sale device — be it a sleek Square terminal, traditional Verifone keypad, and even a kiosk at a movie theater — there are expensive and bulky security measures built into the hardware. From various security chips and even a gold-mesh layer under the keypad to prevent tampering, there are limitations to the actual hardware required to process payments.

Es gab eine Ausschreibung, und der Vergabeausschuss hat denkbar knapp mit drei Stimmen dafür, drei Gegenstimmen und einer Enthaltung die Vergabe an ein Unternehmen gestoppt. Initiator dieser Entscheidung ist der bündnisgrüne Stadtrat Jürgen Canehl. Er sagt: „Die Stadt möchte ein geneigte Geländer bauen. Damit wird es für Radfahrer und Fußgänger im Bereich der Ausfahrt in Richtung Innenstadt noch enger. Das wollen wir nicht und möchten das Thema noch einmal im Bauausschuss diskutieren.“ Beim Magdeburger Oberbürgermeister Lutz Trümper sorgt das für Fassungslosigkeit. Er sagt: „Damit überschreitet der Vergabeausschuss seine Kompetenzen. Seine Aufgabe ist allein festzustellen, ob das Vergabeverfahren rechtmäßig abgelaufen ist.“ Stattdessen werde der Vergabeausschuss genutzt um im Stadtrat gefasste Beschlüsse zu torpedieren, so der Oberbürgermeister.",V,de,Volksstimme

Warum er das tut, erschließt sich erst nach und nach durch Rückblenden: Er fährt mit dem Instrument zu seiner todkranken Mutter. Panikattacken inklusive.

""Die perfekte Zukunft"" war Thema des sechsten Street Art Festivals ""Calle Libre"". Gestern, Samstag, ging die einwöchige Veranstaltung zu Ende, die es sich zum Ziel gesetzt hat, mehr Straßenkunst und Farbe in Wiens öffentlichen Raum zu bringen. Die Idee kam Organisator Jakob Kattner vor einigen Jahren auf einer Studienreise durch Südamerika. Passend dazu hätte das Thema der diesjährigen Ausgabe eigentlich ""Mexiko"" sein sollen - dann kam Corona. Kurier / Jeff Mangione Die Kreativen ließen sich von der Hitze der vergangenen Tage nicht ausbremsen und schufteten mehrere Stunden täglich. Statt mexikanische Künstlerinnen und Künstler einzufliegen, wurde vermehrt europäischen ""Street Artists"" die Möglichkeit gegeben, sich mit teils meterhohen Kunstwerken auf Wiens Hausmauern zu verewigen. Und da die vergangenen Monate und Corona zeigten, wie schnell sich die Welt - wie wir sie kennen - verändern kann, wurde auch gleich das Thema des Festivals angepasst: Die Street-Art-Painter sollten ihre Version einer perfekten Zukunft darstellen.",V,de,KURIER Medienhaus

Mit der Verfügung, die in 45 Tagen greifen soll, verbietet Trump US-Bürgern, «Geschäfte» mit Bytedance, dem Eigentürmer der App, zu machen. Die App stelle eine «Bedrohung» der nationalen Sicherheit dar, hieß es in der Verfügung. Die App sammle große Mengen an Nutzerdaten und könne es der kommunistischen Partei China ermöglichen, Amerikaner auszuspionieren, hieß es. Trump hatte jüngst mit Nachdruck auf einen Verkauf des US-Geschäfts der App an ein amerikanisches Unternehmen gedrängt. Mit der Verfügung scheint er dies zu erzwingen: Falls der Erlass nicht noch von einem Gericht für ungültig erklärt werden sollte, dürfte Tiktok in den USA in 45 Tagen nicht mehr verfügbar sein.

Im Fall der Katastrophe von Beirut hat der KURIER vier der irrsten Verschwörungstheorien zusammengetragen, die tatsächlich in einschlägigen Chatgruppen geteilt und weitergeleitet werden.

Dass die Katastrophe nämlich möglicherweise eine misslungene Waffenlieferung der iranischen Revolutionsgarden für die Hisbollah oder Präsident Assad von Syrien war.“ Diese Vermutung ergibt Sinn.

Das neue Pixel 4a bietet gegenüber seinem großen Verwandten sogar einen Vorteil in Corona-Zeiten: Statt auf Gesichtserkennung zu setzen, die von den Masken gestört würde, hielten die Macher an dem Fingerabdruck-Scanner auf der Rückseite aus der 3er-Reihe fest. Die Entscheidung dazu fiel noch vor der Pandemie. Zugleich trumpft das 4a mit der verbesserten Kamera des aktuellen Top-Modells auf - und behielt auch den für viele wichtigen klassischen Klinken-Anschluss für Kopfhörer. Ohne Sensoren für sichere Gesichtserkennung kommt das Pixel 4a mit einem kleinen Loch für die Selfie-Kamera im 5,8 Zoll großen Display aus, das sonst praktisch die gesamte Oberfläche einnimmt.

Der Film startet nach Einbruch der Dämmerung etwa 21.15 Uhr. 1932 erzählte George Cukor zum ersten Mal die Geschichte vom Serviermädchen, das als Talent entdeckt und zum Star wird, während der Erfolg ihres Förderers schwindet und ihm der Alkohol den Rest gibt. Es folgten etliche Remakes. Es ist der Wandel im Showbusiness, der die Wiederauferstehung dieser zeitlosen Liebesgeschichte so attraktiv macht, denn vor allem ist Bradley Coopers aktuelle Version des Stoffs ein atemberaubender Musikfilm, heißt es in der Ankündigung.",V,de,Mainpost

Bundesgesundheitsminister Jens Spahn kündigte am Montag eine entsprechende Testpflicht an, die voraussichtlich kommende Woche in Kraft treten soll. Die Tests sollen für alle kostenfrei sein, betonte Spahn am Montagabend im ZDF-""Heute Journal"" und in den ARD-""Tagesthemen"". Das Testen dürfe ""niemals eine Kostenfrage für den Einzelnen sein"" und auch ""keine soziale Frage"", so der CDU-Politiker im ""Heute Journal"". Spahn betonte auch, dass die Testpflicht allein für Rückkehrer aus Risikoländern gelten solle, also aus Ländern mit hohen Infektionszahlen. Eine Ausweitung auf Nicht-Risikoländer schloss der Minister aus. ""Am Ende (…) ist das ja ein Eingriff in die persönliche Freiheit"", sagte Spahn in den ""Tagesthemen"". Ein solcher müsse ""natürlich auch gut gerechtfertigt sein"" und ""verhältnismäßig sein"". Bei Risikoländern sei eine Testpflicht durch das Infektionsschutzgesetz gedeckt.",V,de,Volksstimme

Und dann ging es oft an mehreren Abenden kräftig musikalisch zur Sache. In diesem Jahr bleibt alles ruhig. „Die derzeitige Situation und die Auflagen lassen eine solche Veranstaltung nicht zu, wir mussten in diesem Jahr absagen“, hatte Veranstalterin Heike Gentz vor einigen Wochen erklärt. Dafür melden sich einige Bands, die in den vergangenen Jahren bei der Rocknacht dabei waren oder in diesem Jahr hätten dabei sein sollen. Die Mitglieder der Queen-Coverband „Rockfonie“ bedauern die Absage. Die Band habe eine Reihe von Absagen zu verkraften, sagt Sänger und Gitarrist Claus Kulisch. „Nur am heimischen Herd zu versauern ist nicht unser Ding“, sagt er und so ging die Band ins Internet. „Wir haben uns vernetzt und mit sogenannten Wohnzimmerkonzerten unser Publikum erreicht.“ Das habe funktioniert. „Pro Konzert gab es zwischen 300 und 3000 virtuelle Gäste.“ Claus Kulisch empfiehlt einmal in die Titel, die die Bandmitglieder einzeln in ihren Wohnzimmern aufgenommen haben, hinanzuhören.",V,de,Volksstimme

Der digitalpolitische Sprecher der SPD, Jens Zimmermann, forderte im «Handelsblatt» schnelle Aufklärung durch Gesundheitsminister Jens Spahn (CDU). Das Gesundheitsministerium hatte dazu erklärt, das Problem sei seit längerem bekannt und auch Thema in den Fragen-und-Antworten (FAQ) der App. Der SPD geht das aber nicht weit genug. «Es ist mehr als ärgerlich, dass die zuständigen Fachpolitiker von dieser Sache aus den Medien erfahren. Ich hätte mir eine offene Kommunikation durch das Gesundheitsministerium gewünscht», kritisierte Zimmermann. Auch die stellvertretende Bundesvorsitzende der FDP, Katja Suding, kritisierte das Vorgehen in der «Bild»: «Der fehlende Mut, offen mit Fehlern in der App umzugehen, ist brandgefährlich.» Ab jetzt müsse gelten, alle Fehler zu finden, sie zu beheben und transparent zu kommunizieren. «Transparenz sieht anders aus», meinte auch die digitalpolitische Sprecherin der AfD, Joana Cotar.",V,de,Westfalen-Blatt

Die Technikfreunde sind derweil froh, das Museum nach den jüngsten Erleichterungen bei den Kontakteinschränkungen überhaupt wieder öffnen zu können. An eine gewohnte Festwoche war in der Kürze der Zeit ebenso wenig zu denken wie an das kurzfristige Buchen von Prominenten oder Attraktionen. Zumal der Trägerverein „nebenbei“ noch ein Hygienekonzept für den Besuch des Technikstützpunktes erarbeiten musste. Letzteres wird auch an den Festtagen viele Leute für die Einlasskontrolle auf dem Freigelände, in Hallen und Garagen sowie für Dokumentation oder Desinfektion binden, die sich in normalen Zeiten sonst anderen Dingen widmen könnten. Trotzdem werde man versuchen, den Besuchern Kurzweil zu bieten und natürlich jede Menge Technik und Gerätschaften aus früheren Zeiten zu zeigen, so Christian von Hagen.",V,de,Volksstimme

Um präziser zu sein: Diese Rampe und mehr wird es bald im Arne-Carlsson-Park geben. Bezirksvorsteherin Saya Ahmad (SPÖ) hat bereits vor einem Jahr einen Antrag eingebracht, welcher auch schon beschlossen wurde. Die Miniramp ist nicht das einzige Schmakerl für die Skater aus dem Alsergrund, denn es soll noch mehr dazukommen. Es werden auch zusätzliche Hindernisse, sogenannte ""Obstacles"", auf dem Bunker im Park errichtet.

In terms of valuation, its closest comparable multiples could be in the payments space, not other mortgage companies or financial institutions. But because its business is more cyclical than payments, it'll likely have a slight discount to traditional payments giants. The company, citing its quiet period, declined to comment. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . After 35 years as a private firm, the parent company of mortgage giant Quicken Loans is set for a public-market debut. Rocket Companies filed paperwork earlier this month to list on the New York Stock Exchange and its initial public offering will likely price before the end of July, a person with knowledge of the process told Business Insider.

2020-07-11 05:08:08-05:00,Looking for 'moat' to pick stocks? Pat Dorsey tells you how to find it,"Ace investor Pat Dorsey says investors should target 10 to 15 moated businesses that can compound at high rates over time and make long-term investment in them to create major wealth.Dorsey is the Founder of the Chicago-based Dorsey Asset Management and is a former director of Equity Research at Morningstar. He is also the author of the highly acclaimed books The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing and The Little Book that Builds Wealth.He says moated businesses can drastically reduce the risk of permanent loss of capital. A ‘moat’ is a metaphor that investment legend Warren Buffett first used to convey the idea of a company’s competitive advantage.“In most businesses you see high returns on capital decrease over time as competition comes in. However, there is a very small minority of businesses that enjoy many years of high returns on capital. They essentially beat the odds. They defy economic gravity. And the question simply becomes, how? And in my view, it's because they've created structural advantages, economic moats -- a way of insulating themselves, buffering themselves against the competition – which enables them to maintain supernormal returns on capital longer than academic theory,” he said in a presentation at Talks at Google, whose video is now available on YouTube.What is not a 'moat'Dorsey says investors often mistake businesses with traits like quality products, strong market shares, great operational execution and great managements as one having ‘moats’.",V,en,Economic Times India

Auch Reifeprüfungen in abgespeckter Form gab es in Kriegszeiten häufig. Peter Alexander und Loriot machten es, genauso wie Dietmar Schönherr oder der Schriftsteller Sigfried Lenz: Sie absolvierten eine Kriegsmatura bzw. ein Notabitur. Mit der abgespeckten Version der Matura, wie sie der Corona-Jahrgang machen durfte, hat dies allerdings wenig zu tun. Alan Ross, Historiker am Institut für Bildungswissenschaften der Uni Wien, erläutert, warum: „Die Kriegsmatura hatte einen anderen Hintergrund: Man brauchte die Männer für die Front und machte ihnen dafür Versprechungen.“ Leere Versprechungen, wie sich nach dem Krieg herausstellen sollte. Denn die jungen Männer glaubten, dass diese Matura gleich viel wert sei, wie eine herkömmliche. Doch weit gefehlt. Als sie wieder zu hause waren, stellten die Männer häufig enttäuscht fest, dass ihr Zeugnis von damals nichts wert war. „Oft wurden die Kriegsheimkehrer wieder in reguläre Schulklassen geschickt – da saßen dann Pubertierende neben 25-jährigen Männern“, berichtet Ross.",V,de,KURIER Medienhaus

Hier geht es nicht mehr um Prüfungen oder Konzepte, sondern um einen konkreten Auftrag aus der Politik an die Verwaltung, das seit zwei Jahren geschlossene Freibad tatsächlich zu sanieren.

IFR-based savings for merchants and acquirers come at a price for issuers — but card networks' revenue continues to rise.

Das ist angelehnt an die Band Talk Talk, die er liebt, die auch seine Eltern gehört haben – mehr noch als Peter Gabriel und Genesis.

If you're deemed ""politically incorrect"", you will be silenced, fired and harassed by major corporations, journalists and ""activists"" who claim to be committed to social justice and equality.

Mit der „Night of Light“ machte die Veranstaltungswirtschaft in der Nacht von Montag (22. Juni) zu Dienstag in ganz Deutschland in einer spektakulären Art auf sich aufmerksam. Seit dem 10. März stehen in diesem Wirtschaftsbereich faktisch alle Räder still. Ein Ende ist nicht in Sicht. Unzählige Arbeitsplätze sind akut bedroht und viele Unternehmen stehen vor dem Aus. Alle Signale stehen somit auf Rot. Und mit der Farbe Rot wollen die Initiatoren, die „Initiative für die Veranstaltungswirtschaft“ und die teilnehmenden Unternehmen und deren Mitarbeiter signalisieren, dass sie sich auf der Liste der aussterbenden Branchen befinden. Aus diesem Grund wurden in rund 250 Städten Spielstätten und ausgewählte Gebäude rot illuminiert. Auch die Werbegemeinschaft Salzwedel und das Hanseat beteilitgen sich an dieser Aktion. Während Maik Rossat von „Kupfermusik“ das Neupervertor in rotes Licht hüllte und ein paar Meter weiter auch das Kulturhaus in diesem Licht erstrahlte, tauchten Michael (Elvis) Schulze und Paul Hiersche das Hanseat in der Altperverstraße ebenfalls in die Signalfarbe Rot.",V,de,Volksstimme

Anna Netrebko ist Elisabetta, Königin von Spanien - ohne Kostüm und Perücke. Mit dem ersten Ton des Duetts «Io vengo a domandar» aus Giuseppe Verdis «Don Carlo» nimmt ihre Stimme die rund 330 Zuhörer gefangen, die später die russische Sopranistin, eine der prominentesten Sängerinnen der Gegenwart, feiern. Alle drei Aufführungen bis Montag sind ausverkauft. Elisabetta ist für Netrebko musikalisch und psychologisch eine Herausforderung. «Diese Rolle hat viele niedrige Tessitura und sehr lange Phrasen im mittleren Register», sagte sie der Deutschen Presse-Agentur. «Meiner Meinung nach wurde es für Sopran-Spinto geschrieben, was ich im Prinzip nicht bin.» Sie habe hart daran arbeiten müssen. Auch ohne Kulissen, Requisiten und großes Orchester ist Verdis Oper präsent.

Der Ball sei nun „in der amerikanischen Seite des Spielfeldes“, sagte Rjabko. Gleiches Recht für alle? Das Problem heißt dabei - nicht nur aus Trumps Sicht - allerdings China: Denn das militärische Aufrüsten Pekings ist unübersehbar. Washington will daher unbedingt China als Vertragspartner in den - bisher nur zwischen Russland und den USA vereinbarten - Rüstungskontrollverträgen. Andernfalls, so Trumps Logik, sei es besser, gar keine Beschränkungen zu haben, um keinen Rüstungsnachteil gegenüber Peking zu erleiden.",V,de,KURIER Medienhaus

Subscribe today to receive industry-changing payments and commerce news and analysis to your inbox. The $22 trillion business-to-business (B2B) US payments market is facing a paradox. High invoice volume (a business can see anywhere from hundreds to tens of thousands of invoices per month) and small departments that still use largely analog process are driving a desire to digitize: Enterprises using digital payables platforms can see 81% lower processing costs and 73% faster processing cycle times, per Kofax. But accounts payable is a complex process, and entrenched habits and limited resources have stymied digitization and kept companies set in their ways.

Subscribe today to receive industry-changing payments and commerce news and analysis to your inbox. Payments firms have introduced buy buttons to streamline the online checkout process, but so many have done so that it can have the opposite effect. This led companies to introduce buy buttons so consumers could skip the cumbersome, labor-intensive steps required to input contact and payment information online, and to allow them to shop online more freely. But the array of options has become overwhelming. Firms such as Mastercard, Visa, Apple, Amazon, Walmart, point-of-sale (POS) financing providers, and many more have developed buy buttons for their payment methods. This glut undercuts the convenience buy buttons are meant to introduce, as consumers don't know which option will be available where, and they must search crowded checkout pages for their desired option.",V,en,Business Insider

It's one of fintechs buzziest startups, aiming to rebuild B2B financial products starting with corporate cards for technology companies. The company was quietly launched in 2017 by Henrique Dubugras and Pedro Franceschi, two 22-year-old engineers who previously founded Pagar.me, one of Brazil's largest payment processors. Brex already has more than 1,000 customers signed up with the help of backing from investors including PayPal co-founders Peter Thiel and Max Levchin, early Facebook investor Yuri Milner, former Visa CEO Carl Pascarella, and esteemed startup incubator Y Combinator. And we caught a glimpse of the Series B pitch deck Dubugras and Franceschi used to win them over.

As a result, I'm certainly going out of my way to avoid retailers that don't support contactless payment options right now like Apple Pay, something more people are doing out of a realization that exchanging paper money represents one more potentially dangerous touchpoint in a coronavirus world. The Target store where I make my regular grocery run isn't the closest such option to my apartment, and there are a few things about the overall experience that are less than ideal -- such as having to sometimes wait in line outside the store, since Target is now one of several retailers limiting how many shoppers can be inside at any one time to promote social distancing.

2020-05-21 10:36:00-05:00,The 6 best credit cards for bad credit in May 2020,"Having a low credit score makes it harder to get approved for a new credit card and other types of loans, and it means that when you do get approved for, say, a mortgage, you'll generally get less-favorable terms like the highest variable interest rates. A bad credit score is defined as anything below 580, according to the FICO scoring model, and anything below 601 according to VantageScore. If you currently find yourself in this credit score range, you probably won't get approved for popular rewards cards like the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card , but you do have some credit card options. Secured credit cards are particularly easy to get approved for, because you put up a cash deposit as collateral to get started, and there are also non-secured cards tailored to those looking to repair or build their credit. Using a card responsibly will help boost your credit over time, since keeping your credit utilization low and making on-time payments are the two biggest factors that determine your credit score .",V,en,Business Insider

Um auch als kleine Firma einen solidarischen Beitrag leisten zu können, wurde nun kurzerhand auf die Herstellung von Masken ausgeweitet. Aus bereits unter dem Öko-Tex Standard 100 produzierter (natürlich noch nicht getragener) Strumpfware entsteht bunter Mund-Nasen-Schutz. DillySocks Dieser schützt nicht nur Mitmenschen vor Viren, sondern ist auch etwas fürs Auge. Unser Favorit: die Version mit Erdbeer- oder Herzerl-Muster. Kostenpunkt pro Maske: 14,90 Euro. Wer bei seinem Erscheinungsbild nichts dem Zufall überlassen möchte, kann für 24,90 Euro gleich die Kombination aus Maske und den dazu passenden Socken über dillysocks.com bestellen. Der Erlös wird an die internationale Corona-Hilfe der Caritas gespendet.",V,de,Kurier.at

In dem Ende März abgeschlossenen Geschäftsjahr wurden damit gut 21 Millionen Switch-Konsolen verkauft – auch dank der Markteinführung einer günstigeren Version im Herbst. Durch die Corona-Krise habe es zwar Engpässe in der Switch-Produktion wegen fehlender Bauteile gegeben, das habe die Zahlen aber nicht wesentlich beeinflusst, betonte Nintendo. Das neue Spiel der Reihe ""Animal Crossing"" legte in der Corona-Zeit den bisher besten Start eines Switch-Games mit 13,4 Millionen Verkäufen in sechs Wochen hin. Auch Umsatz und Gewinn stiegen in dem üblicherweise nach Weihnachten eher schlechten Quartal deutlich. Nintendo schloss danach das Geschäftsjahr mit einem Umsatzplus von neun Prozent auf 1,3 Billionen Yen (11,3 Mrd Euro) ab.

2020-05-05 15:48:00-05:00,5 Reasons Why Institutional Investors Refuse to Join the Crypto Sector,"Crypto investors have long believed that institutional investors would lead to the next Bitcoin moon event but this is a false narrative built on nothing more than hope. For the past two years, crypto-media outlets and Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocates have placed heavy emphasis on the need for institutional investors to embrace the cryptocurrency sector. The oft-stated belief was that institutional inflow would lead to mass adoption and an incredible spike in the value of crypto-assets as a whole. Fast forward to the present, and the total cryptocurrency market capitalization has yet to reach the $750 billion all-time high seen in late 2017. The slow recovery of crypto prices raises a few hard to answer questions. If institutional funds have been flowing into cryptocurrencies, why hasn’t there been a significant price increase over the last three years? Either there is an almost infinite sell pressure — which shouldn’t be a barrier considering the total crypto market cap is just $248 billion — or this theory that institutional investment will pump crypto prices does not hold.",V,en,Cointelegraph

It has impacted how we spend, send, and use money, with a tsunami-like ripple effect on many parts of the global economy. By mid-March, online shopping in the US had already surged 35% from 2019 levels 1 , driven by store closures, limited in-store inventory, and shelter-in-place orders. While businesses of all sizes have been impacted, small businesses are in a particularly tough situation. Forced to find new ways to conduct business, less than half (46%) of US small businesses report having any online presence at all 2 . Even worse, 54% of small businesses in the US report they are closed or could close within the coming weeks in response to COVID-19 3 . While these sellers may be small, they play a critical role in the lives of their customers, employees, and partners — and helping them has a broad ripple effects on their communities and economies.",V,en,Business Insider

Dies sei ein „beratendes Gremium“ der Ärztekammer , beschrieb deren Sprecher Sascha Bunda und bestätigte einen Bericht der Kleinen Zeitung: Durch seine Äußerungen „leugne er jegliche Richtigkeit der Informationen betreffend Corona“ und würde „zum zivilen Ungehorsam aufrufen“.",V,de,Kurier.at

Wegen schweren Raubes ist am Mittwoch am Landesgericht Klagenfurt ein 24-jähriger Kärntner zu zehn Jahren Haft verurteilt worden. Ein Schöffensenat sah es als erwiesen an, dass der Mann im Herbst 2019 in einem Klagenfurter Park einem 17-Jährigen mit vorgehaltenem Messer 30 Euro geraubt hatte. Das Urteil ist nicht rechtskräftig. Der acht Mal einschlägige vorbestrafte Angeklagte war nicht geständig - er brachte einen völlig anderen Ablauf der Ereignisse ins Spiel.

Da die Lieferung ausblieb, habe er ihn sich vorgeknöpft und ihm drei Päckchen Cannabis abgepresst. Deshalb bekannte er sich ""nur"" der schweren Nötigung schuldig, nicht aber des schweren Raubes, worauf eine viel höhere Strafdrohung steht.

Als aber die Zahl für das allerletzte Feld feststand - 18,4 Trillionen Körner - war ihm das Lachen vergangen. Bei dieser Art der Verdoppelung hätten sämtliche Kornkammern Indiens zu wenig zu bieten.

The transaction fees can be expensive, often a few percentage points of the total. And it usually takes several days to settle. Similar middlemen are found in traditional asset trading and banking, as well. Not only do they complicate these processes, but they charge for their services. In the end, you bear the cost. But Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) — or the blockchain — has disrupted and reshaped the finance sector by removing these middlemen.

The bookkeeping software giant has agreed to purchase the credit scoring fintech for $7 billion in cash and stock, which marks Intuit's biggest acquisition to date, according to a press release. Under the deal, Credit Karma will continue to operate as a standalone entity, but both companies are able to leverage data from one another. Here's how the deal benefits both Intuit and Credit Karma: Intuit boasts a large product suite, partly due to its previous acquisitions — and this deal helps it further diversify its offering by wading deeper into consumer finance. On the business finance front, Intuit most famously developed Quickbooks , an accounting software tool that includes services for payroll and taxes. But Intuit has also been busy building out its consumer financing product suite: Intuit acquired Mint for $170 million in 2009 to help users better manage their finances, and its service Turbotax helps customers do their taxes, for example.",V,en,Business Insider

Unlike Android devices, Apple's devices don't allow access to the NFC chip through apps other than Apple's own Wallet app, which means financial bodies must sign an ‌Apple Pay‌ agreement that allows the card to be registered in the Wallet.

Rassistisch klingt das Buch nur, weil Amerikanischer Bürgerkrieg herrscht und auf Baumwollplantagen Sklaven arbeiten. Stellung bezogen hat Mitchell (1900 – 1949) nicht. „Ihr“ Rhett Butler ist immerhin höflich zu den schwarzen Arbeitern und macht sich über die Nachthemden vom Ku-Klux-Klan lustig.

Vieles weiß man über den ehemaligen Papst Benedikt XVI., vulgo Joseph Ratzinger . Aber dass er als junger Mann ein Fan von Zarah Leander war und im Fernsehen am liebsten „Kommissar Rex“ anschaute („Man nennt mich Gottes Rottweiler. Das gefällt mir“), dürfte nur wenigen Gläubigen bekannt sein. Auch sonst gibt es einige Geheimnisse zu enthüllen. Im Jahr 2013 beschloss Benedikt , freiwillig aus dem Amt zu scheiden. Warum er das tat, darüber spekuliert der Netflix-Film „Die zwei Päpste“ in Form eines vergnüglichen Kammerspiels in Top-Besetzung. Ausgerechnet seinem Kontrahenten und potenziellen Nachfolger, dem argentinischen Kardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio – und jetzigem Papst Franziskus – setzt Benedikt seine Beweggründe auseinander.

Noch vor Weihnachten will das Land einen Generalunternehmer ausschreiben. In einem wettbewerblichen Dialog soll in weiterer Folge ein neues Bauprojekt entwickelt und ab 2021 errichtet werden. 2018 hatte der zuständige Landesrat Johannes Tratter ( ÖVP ) die Umsetzung eines zwei Jahre zuvor zum Sieger eines Architekturwettbewerbs gekürten Entwurfs gestoppt. Kostenexplosion Tratter argumentierte mit einer Kostenexplosion. Statt 80 Millionen hätte das MCI selbst in einer abgespeckten Version 130 Millionen Euro gekostet, erklärte er damals. Letztlich entschied sich das Land für eine Neuausschreibung.

Am Mittwoch bekam er dafür am Landesgericht St. Pölten die Quittung präsentiert. Zeugin alarmierte die Polizei Der Polizist im Ruhestand hatte sich mit einer Perücke , falschem Schnurrbart und Lesebrille maskiert und hatte in einem Park vor dem Geldinstitut auf eine gute Gelegenheit gewartet, um den Raub zu begehen. Doch einer Zeugin war der 51-Jährige sofort aufgefallen, sie alarmierte die Polizei . Daraufhin flüchtete der Ungar, konnte aber kurze Zeit später festgenommen werden. In den Einvernahmen gab er die Überfallspläne sofort zu. LPD NÖ Perücke wurde sichergestellt 21 Monate Haft Vor dem Richter servierte der Ungar aber eine andere Version.

Der Vorwurf aufgebrachter Eltern: Die auf 24 Folgen angelegte Produktion des Staatsfernsehens SVT würde den lieben Kleinen den Glauben an den „Weihnachtstomte“, die schwedische Version des Weihnachtsmannes, austreiben und sie verstören. Mehrere Zeitungen berichten von „Raserei“ unter den Eltern. In der ersten Folge von „Panik in der Tomtewerkstatt“ erzählt der Weihnachtsmann, dass sich die Eltern der Kinder als Weihnachtstomten verkleiden würden. Damit zerstöre er die Illusion vieler Kinder, die wirklich daran glauben, vom Weihnachtstomte beschenkt zu werden: „Wir haben solange darum gekämpft, die Magie zu behalten, und nun bleiben uns nur noch die Palatschinken.

Ein Außenseiter, vom ganzen Dorf an den Rand – und darüber hinaus – gedrängt. Passiert irgendetwas, geben ihm alle die Schuld. Versucht er sich zusammenzureißen, hilft’s auch nicht. Also erfüllt er die Erwartungen der anderen und agiert (jäh-)zornig, böse. Das ist Pavel Holub , die Hauptfigur in Marie von Ebner-Eschenbachs „Das Gemeindekind“ (erstveröffentlicht 1887). Überzeugend kompakt In einer knapp mehr als 1 ½-stündigen Fassung spielt ein engagiertes Ensemble eine überzeugende kompakte Bühnenversion dieses Romans im Theater Spieltraum. Wie fast immer in diesem ehemaligen Kino in der Wiener Kaiserstraße wurde Literatur - vorwiegend österreichische, wenngleich nicht ausschließlich – dramatisiert. Texte, die schon einige Jahrzehnte und mehr sozusagen auf dem Buckel haben. Und doch Themen aufgreifen, als würden sie aus aktueller Zeit entspringen.

Schon ziemlich lange bevor das Stück losgeht, unterhält der Musik einsam von der Bühne aus das Publikum, das sich zu den Sitzen begibt. Auf alles was auch nur klingen könnte, trommelt Robert Lepnik – mit Drum-Sticks oder was auch immer ihm in die Hände fällt – und natürlich auch „nur“ mit letzteren. Am schrägsten wirkt wohl der Turnschuh den er sich anzieht und der vorne dran einen Trommelschläger angeklebt hat. Das macht natürlich sogar bei jedem Schritt auf dem Holzboden Geräusche, mitunter auch Klänge. Er ist die Bonus-Figur im Märchen „Der gestiefelte Kater “. Er, sowie Regisseur Simon Windisch und die Gestalterin der Bühne, Lisa Horvath , waren übrigens schon beim Kinderstück in der vorigen Saison „ Alice im Wunderland “ für ihre Bereiche verantwortlich.

Hence, it is the airline that is liable for payment and not MMT, they told the court. HDFC Bank’s lawyers, in the subsequent hearings, argued that the bank has deducted money out of a separate merchant account and has done it in accordance with a “merchant agreement” it has signed with its merchant, MMT, and that the bank is very much 'within rights' to do so as per the agreement.In an interim order on September 26, the High Court has asked HDFC Bank to keep the money it deducts from MMT in a “separate suspense account” and not to remit it back to the customers till the next date of hearing in January. “The matter is in court of law and is sub judice,” said Ateev Mathur, a lawyer representing HDFC Bank. “The bank is taking steps to file its reply before the court to challenge the claim, which the bank will do in accordance with law.”A spokesperson for MMT declined to comment saying the matter is sub judice.",V,en,The Economic Times India

Auffallende Schönheiten sind eher selten. Das war über Jahrtausende so. Doch heute werden wir ständig mit Ikonen der Schönheit konfrontiert.“ Kurier/Novy Gilbert Philosoph Liessmann: ""Das Ansehen durch Aussehen nimmt zu“ Das errege nicht nur Aufmerksamkeit – es führe auch dazu, dass man sich immer mit diesen Bildern vergleiche: „Wir versuchen diesen Idealen nachzueifern, die immer als mehr oder weniger verschwiegener Vorwurf im Raum stehen: Warum bin ich nicht so schön?“ Liessmann war einer der Referenten bei der Jubiläumstagung der vor 20 Jahren gegründeten „Austrian Academy of Cosmetic Surgery & Aesthetic Medicine“.",V,de,Kurier.at

Für seine Möbel muss kein Baum gefällt werden: Innenarchitekt Oliver Schübbe von der OS2 Designgroup arbeitet mit dem Material, das auf Bauhöfen entsorgt wird – und möchte somit den ökologischen Kreislauf aufrechterhalten. Im Interview erzählt er von seiner Herangehensweise im Upcycling-Prozess und wie sich die Möbelbranche verändert hat. Was ist eigentlich der Unterschied zwischen Recycling und Upcycling? Oliver Schübbe : Upcycling bedeutet, eine Wertsteigerung in der Wiederverwendung von Materialien im Vergleich zum Ausgangsprodukt zu erzielen. Recycling wäre da eher die generelle Wiederverwendung, wie z.B. bei Glas, Papier und Metallen. Als Downcycling könnte man z.B. die Verwendung von Plastikbechern für Lärmschutzwände bezeichnen. Lefti Inwiefern hat sich das Image von Recyclingmöbeln in den vergangenen Jahren verändert? Es geht bei Upcyclingmöbeln mehr in Richtung Materialforschung.",V,de,Kurier.at

Jim Magats, PayPal's senior vice president of payments, product and engineering, told Business Insider the move was meant to offer customers more options and put PayPal at the center of a payments ecosystem.

This should be a wakeup call for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). RBI’s views have been quite regressive on the subject, vacillating between woeful under-estimation of the potential of technology, and its unfounded fear of fringe ‘bad-actor’ use cases.But, first, why is the announcement of Facebook Libra significant, given that bitcoin has existed for a decade now? In 2018, about $2.4 billion in bitcoin transactions were processed by payment processors. This was a tiny sliver of the $2.8 trillion e-commerce sales worldwide that year. In addition, after the early run-up in prices, a certain ‘crypto-fatigue’ has set in, especially among late adopters who flocked to the market in 2016-17.Crypto CrosswordThe predominantly technical nature of the ‘crypto-community’ has also resulted in the average user being faced with a subpar user experience, and with no way to discriminate between a legitimate cryptocurrency with a realuse case, and a get-rich-quick scheme your friend forwarded on WhatsApp.",V,en,The Economic Times India

These directives were applicable not only to payment entities but also to all banks operating in India, it further added.In April 2018, the RBI had issued a note mandating that all payments firms should store data within India.

However, the data shall be stored only in India after the processing,” RBI said in a note released on Wednesday.The central bank had given a 24-hour timeframe within which the data needs to be brought back to India after processing is completed outside the country.In cases of charge back or any other reconciliation processes that might need to be undertaken, it can be done by accessing the data from servers in India. “In such a case, the data needs to be deleted from the systems abroad and brought to India not later than one business day or 24 hours from payment processing, whichever is earlier.",V,en,The Economic Times India

In emerging markets, these changes will be driven by Asia, which remains at the helm of digital transformation in payments as customers in major markets like China, India, and Southeast Asia flock to wallets like Alipay and Paytm and super-apps like WeChat and Grab in lieu of cash and cards for their payments, both online and in-store. Change looks different in mature markets like the US, where the overall expansion of the digital payments market will remain more tempered, but mobile's impact will surge as customers move from PCs to mobile and other emerging connected devices for their online shopping, and replace small-dollar cash P2P transactions with mobile apps like Venmo and Zelle.",V,en,Business Insider

From Sunday, India imposed higher tariffs on some US goods, days after Washington withdrew a key trade privilege for New Delhi.Two senior Indian government officials said on Wednesday they were briefed last week on a US government plan to cap H-1B visas issued each year to Indians at between 10% and 15% of the annual quota.There is no current country-specific limit on the 85,000 H-1B work visas granted each year and an estimated 70% go to Indians.Both officials said they were told the plan was linked to the global push for ""data localisation"", in which a country places restrictions on data as a way to gain better control over it and potentially curb the power of international companies.",V,en,The Economic Times India

Given its fiat backing, Credit Suisse analyst Moshe Orenbuch said Libra should be relatively stable compared to popular cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. At the same time, earnings on the reserve of currencies should cover Libra’s operating costs, making the cryptocurrency itself and extremely low-cost option for digital payments. The combination of low transaction fees and fiat currency backing will make Libra an attractive method of sending cross-border payments, and Orenbuch said adoption in this area will likely be rapid.

Pegging the crypto in this way is meant to reduce the volatility that's resulted in wild price swings for other cryptos.

Modi has been held in a UK prison since his first court appearance on March 20, when he was denied bail.Nirav Modi had entered the UK on a ‘golden visa’, issued by the British government on his Indian passport, which was revoked in February this year. The golden visa, issued to investors outside the EU on a commitment to invest £2 million (Rs 18 crore) in UK government bonds or in active and trading UK companies, was apparently issued to Modi a few years ago. Revocation of passport does not affect the validity of the visa.In court last week, the defence lawyer said he arrived in the UK in January 2018 and that is a key plank of their defence.Reforms in rules for UK’s golden visas will also be implemented from March 29. Golden visas aim to encourage rich non-EU citizens to make substantial investments in the UK economy, by offering them the right to live, work, study and settle in Britain. But, the scheme has faced criticism, with some questioning the legitimacy of funds used to make investments.UK government bonds, which were also a qualifying investment (or option for investment), will be excluded from March 29.",V,en,The Economic Times India

About 78% of workers in the United States are living paycheck to paycheck, and the statistics don’t improve from there. Only 39% of Americans actually have saved enough money to cover a $1000 emergency. Nearly 3 in 4 workers say they are in debt and of those, more than half think they always will be, according to statistics posted by Forbes . Any rise in interest rates or the cost of food could leave some Americans with the tough choice of eating or paying the car payment to get to work. A similar 2016 GOBankingRates survey found that 69 percent of Americans had less than $1,000 in total savings and 34 percent had no savings at all. That means many Americans would have to put an emergency expense on a credit card or borrow money another way just to cover the cost of a $1000 expense. Making matters worse, the 2017 Report on the Economic Wellbeing of US Households stated that, when asked how they would cover an emergency expense of $400, only 59% of Americans said they could easily cover the expense using entirely cash, savings, or a credit card paid off at the next statement.",V,en,Zero Hedge

In April, the Trump administration hit three companies Deripaska controls with sanctions over Russian interference in the 2016 US elections; EN+, Rusal and JSC EuroSibEnergo. Following the announcement, the Treasury Department delayed their implementation - eventually deciding in December that they would be lifted following an aggressive lobbying campaign by Deripaska's network. Democratic lawmakers sent Mr. Mnuchin a letter on Tuesday seeking an explanation for why the termination of the sanctions was justified. They expressed concern that Mr. Deripaska still maintained “significant ownership” of En+, the holding company that controls Rusal, while transferring shares to VTB, a sanctioned Russian bank. They also said that the government shutdown was hampering their ability to properly review the decision.",V,en,Zero Hedge

Global tensions caused by economic sanctions and trade conflicts triggered by Washington have forced targeted countries to take a fresh look at alternative payment systems currently dominated by the US dollar. RT has taken a deeper look into the recent phenomena of de-dollarization, summing up which countries have taken steps towards eliminating their reliance on the greenback, and the reasons behind their decision. China The ongoing trade conflict between the United States and China, as well as sanctions against Beijing's biggest trading partners have forced China to take steps towards relieving the dollar dependence of the world's second-largest economy.
