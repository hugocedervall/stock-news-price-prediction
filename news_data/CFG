Law firm leaders predict how the rest of the year will play out.","Law firms tightened their belts in March and sought credit, preparing for short-term cash shortfalls by as much as 50%. But from April through June, many of the biggest law firms were comfortably above those thresholds, with attorneys specializing in employment advice, bankruptcy and other in-demand practices kicking into high gear as dealmaking slowed down. Still, law firms aren't out of the woods yet, with some fearing that a struggling economy could dog them for months. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories .

Retreats were cancelled, salaries were slashed, profit distributions were delayed and staff were furloughed at some of the highest-grossing firms. Leaders drew up plans for 20%, even 50% drops in business. For the most part, though, that hasn't happened. Recent interviews and surveys suggest that a typical Big Law firm saw revenue drops in the single percentage points, with Wells Fargo saying demand — hours worked, in industry jargon — fell just 1.4% in the first five months of the year.",CFG,en,Business Insider
