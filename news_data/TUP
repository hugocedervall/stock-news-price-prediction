Its landmark report, ""The New Plastics Economy"" (PDF), sounded the alarm in 2016 that if ""business as usual"" continues, by 2025 the ocean may hold more plastic than fish by weight. Its commitment by the same name has attracted many of the planet's biggest brand names, among 450-plus signatories, to dramatically slash their use or production of plastic by 2025. PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, Unilever and even Tupperware have signed on with governments and NGOs to do away with ""unnecessary"" plastics and innovate so that other plastics will be reused, recycled or composted; and kept out of natural systems. Only five years ago, few corporate leaders had plastic pollution on their official radar. Yet Dame Ellen MacArthur herself is floored by the rapid pace of change in business that has been forced by the COVID-19 pandemic.",TUP,en,GreenBiz

2020-08-10 05:00:04-05:00,Rachel Roddy's recipe for cherries in wine | A kitchen in Rome,"A decadent cherry pudding (or boozy drink) inspired by a woozy summer’s afternoon at a rural getaway In his 2007 book, The Last Food of England , Marwood Yeatman tells a story of a vicar in Landkey, Devon, who noticed the scarlet mouths of his congregation when they sang hymns in high summer. The stain came from mazzards, the West Country name for Prunus avium , the wild or sweet cherries native to the British isles that have been eaten since prehistoric times. The vicar’s memories are of a time when north Devon – particularly the area around Landkey and nearby Barnstaple and Goodleigh – was famous for its mazzards, when trees bearing fruit occupied hedges, closes, village greens and gardens; when handfuls could be pulled from branches and eaten on the way to school or church, to be revealed during O Jesus I Have Promised. Imagining an entire congregation with scarlet mouths, tongues and streaky teeth, fingertips and nail cuticles too, is the most wonderful picture. I am reminded of eating blackberries as a child, putting more in my mouth than into Tupperware, then pointing a scratched arm at my brother’s devilish mouth and laughing until my eye twitched.",TUP,en,The Guardian

2020-02-27 09:34:05-05:00,Tupperware Shares Plummet,"One of the most iconic brands that emerged from the plastic revolution of yore, Tupperware took a beating yesterday in the stock market, with the company's shares losing almost half of their value. The proximate cause of the plunge was a delay in the company filing its annual report because of an “accounting probe” and an expected sales decline across key markets this year, writes Andria Cheng in Forbes . Sales, excluding currency impact, are forecast to decline as much as 11% this year, “extending a streak of sales declines in recent years,” writes Cheng. Tupperware shares dropped 46% to $3.11 yesterday. At its peak just over six years ago, its stock was trading at more than $90 a share, writes Forbes . Ouch! To lift our spirits, we went to the twitterverse for some Tupperware testimonials. There’s a lot of love out there for those plastic containers that go burp, as well as some consternation surrounding the enduring mystery of rogue lids.
