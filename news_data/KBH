Sure, there’s the classic definition of a bear market being 20% off a high. But if we’re talking price action, it might be this: In a bear market, rallies tend to fade, and in bull markets, a downside scare tends to reverse quickly, as bargain hunters swoop in. By that definition, yesterday’s bounce might indicate this bull still has some room to run. The market started the week on the back foot as investors remained worried about the fallout from the killing last week of a top Iranian official in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq. But stocks ended up moving into positive territory during the session. Other signs this morning that tensions have been easing—at least among investors—include that oil was pulling back and equity index futures were pointing to a flat-to-slightly-higher open after gains in Asian and European markets. It’s possible that many investors don’t see the present situation in the Middle East as enough to derail the current decent economic situation in the United States and the help it’s been to the stock market.",KBH,en,Benzinga Feeds

One major mistake is not having enough lights in the space. Another common design mistake is not incorporating multiple surfaces, like coffee tables and end tables, into the room. Visit Insider's homepage for more stories . Your living room is probably one of the first spaces someone sees when entering your home, which means there's a lot of pressure to make it look perfect. To help you do just that, Insider spoke to four interior designers to find out some common decorating blunders and furniture faux paus. Here are some of the biggest mistakes people make when decorating a living room. Buying a rug that is too big or too small for your living room will mess up the entire space. Gena Kirk, the vice president of design at KB Home, told Insider that it's important to ensure that a rug does more than just work within the design scheme of your home — it needs to fit the room you intend to use it in. ""A rug that is too large will look overwhelming in the space and can make the room appear smaller,"" she said. ""A rug that is too small forces your furniture to be closer together, leaving the room feeling unbalanced and [creating] the feeling of wasted empty space."" Before buying a rug, Kirk recommends using painter's tape and exact measurements to create mock outlines on your floor so you can envision how it might look in your space.",KBH,en,Business Insider

2019-03-26 08:15:22-05:00,"Home builder stocks mostly lower, after disappointing data and loss warning from Beacon Roofing","The home-building sector was trading mostly lower Tuesday, in the wake of disappointing housing starts data and a warning of a wider-than-expected loss from roofing materials distributor Beacon Roofing Supply Inc. . The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF fell 0.8%, with 31 of 48 components losing ground. Earlier, the Commerce Department reported February housing starts fell almost 9% to an annual pace of 1.16 million, below the average forecast of economists surveyed by MarketWatch of a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.21 million. And Beacon Roofing's stock tumbled 7.2% after the company said late Monday that it expected a fiscal second-quarter adjusted loss of 45 cents to 55 cents, compared with the current FactSet loss-per-share consensus of 39 cents, and the loss consensus of 25 cents a share at the end of February. The company blamed ""extremely harsh weather conditions"" for the miss. Meanwhile, shares of KB Home , which reports fiscal first-quarter results after the close, fell 0.6%, and Lennar Corp. , which reports before Wednesday's open, slumped 1.3%.",KBH,en,MarketWatch

2019-03-25 11:14:34-05:00,KB Home's stock surges ahead of earnings as Susquehanna expects orders beat,"Shares of home builder KB Home surged 4.8% in afternoon trade Monday, enough to pace the home construction sector's gainers, after an upbeat call by analyst Jack Micenko at Susquehanna, a day ahead of the company's (KBH) fiscal first-quarter results. The company is slated to report results after Tuesday's close. ""We particularly like the set up for KBH into tomorrow's print,"" Micenko wrote in a note to clients. ""The focus will be on orders and we think they will come in better than consensus."" The FactSet consensus for deliveries is 2,187 units and for new orders is 2,576. Micenko said he believes Lennar Corp. , which is scheduled to report results before Wednesday's open, can also beat orders expectations given conservative guidance, but is worried about gross margin guidance for the rest of the year. Lennar shares rose 3.0% in afternoon trade. KB Home's stock has rallied 24.8% year to date and Lennar's stock has run up 26.8%, while the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF has hiked up 16.9% and the S&P 500 has gained 9.4%.",KBH,en,MarketWatch
