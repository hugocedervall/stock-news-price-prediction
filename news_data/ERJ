2020-06-21 07:06:00-05:00,The 8 best 'personal' private jets that only require one pilot to fly,"Personal private jets are intended to be flown by one pilot, often the owner, and are ideal for business, leisure, or a mix of both. Cessna has long dominated the single-pilot jet field with its line of Citation aircraft dating back to the 1970s. New designs from the likes of Cirrus, Embraer, and SyberJet aim to revolutionize the market with faster and simpler jets that don't compromise on luxury. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . One of the major takeaways from the coronavirus pandemic is a greater focus on independence and control, especially when it comes to travel. When thousands of travelers saw flights being canceled en masse due to surprise travel restrictions, the only option for many was to cancel travel plans and some were even stranded overseas as a result. While most are taking back control of travel by sticking to road trips or not traveling at all, one option for the wealthier jet setting public is personal private jets. Unlike traditional private aircraft, these tiny planes are meant to be flown by a single-pilot, often the owner, and are known for their ease of use even when flying in complex airspace.",ERJ,en,Business Insider

In the Americas, larger jets from Gulfstream, Bombardier, and Dassault are among the most preferred. In Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, light and mid-size jets from Cessna and Embraer are seeing increased interest. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . The coronavirus pandemic is turning more wealthy travelers towards private jets as they seek to take control of their travel. Rather than depend on charter operators, however, some with means are making the jump to outright aircraft ownership with the International Aircraft Dealers Association confirming to Business Insider that sales firms are seeing increased interest from first-time buyers. Though still down from pre-pandemic levels, aircraft sales have done comparatively well since March while chartering declined by around 90% in April from normal, the IADA reported .",ERJ,en,Business Insider

2020-05-29 10:49:04-05:00,This private glass pod that can shift from air to land shows what an aerospace giant thinks luxury travel could look like in 50 years — tour the 'Pulse Concept',"Brazilian aerospace conglomerate Embraer recently rendered a futuristic mobility system called the Pulse Concept, which represents where the company thinks air travel may go in the next 50 years. The Pulse Concept uses a high-tech glass pod, which can be flown to a destination by a vertical takeoff and landing aircraft and then transferred to an autonomous vehicle for road travel. Passengers can stay inside the pod as the Pulse smoothly transitions from air to ground travel — at least, that's the idea. Embraer says that some aspects of the Pulse Concept may make their way into actual future vehicles. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . Brazilian aerospace giant Embraer expects air and land travel to look very different in 2070, if its new Pulse Concept vehicle is anything to go by. The concept — which represents Embraer's vision of how travel may evolve over the next 50 years — is basically a mashup of a self-driving car and a vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. It all centers around a private glass-and-metal pod that can be flown to a destination by the aircraft, and then deposited into a self-driving vehicle for land travel. ""The concept entails seamless transportation that allows travel from destination to destination (not just airport to airport) from the comfort and security of the user's own personal space,"" Embraer said in a press release, adding that the Pulse Concept creates ""a seamless transportation loop, moving occupants from air to ground without disturbance."" Many aspects of the vehicle are a long way off — including a ""smart glass window,"" ""see-through alloy metals,"" and fully autonomous driving — but Embraer claims that the concept includes ""conceptual and actual developments that could be introduced in the future.""

2020-02-14 00:05:45-05:00,Asian plane makers struggle to take off in crowded market,"SINGAPORE : Asian plane makers have thrown huge sums at building jets but flagship projects have suffered repeated setbacks, and they face a tough time breaking into a market dominated by established players. The Asia-Pacific region is the world’s biggest aviation market for commercial aircraft and Japanese and Chinese firms have embarked on programmes to build their own planes. Asia’s two biggest economies are home to myriad companies making hi-tech goods, from cars to smartphones, which in many cases have succeeded in rivalling Western firms. But when it comes to building planes -- which requires mammoth investment, years of painstaking development, and rigorous safety standards -- progress has been slow. The companies at the forefront of the Asian drive, Japan’s Mitsubishi and Chinese state-owned manufacturer COMAC, have both seen their flagship projects delayed for years. China “could be successful in 10-15 years but at this time, the odds are not really in their favour”, Shukor Yusof, founder of Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics, told AFP. “The international market is just too saturated with aircraft from the established manufacturers so there’s very little space for new players.” Asia’s biggest air show in Singapore this week was -- as ever -- dominated by European plane maker Airbus, US manufacturer Boeing and a handful of smaller, mostly Western manufacturers.",ERJ,en,The Sun Daily
