The storm complex, blamed for four deaths, hit Cedar Rapids particularly hard, cutting power to almost the entire city of 133,000 people and damaging a wide array of businesses and homes. In an October update to its database of billion-dollar weather disasters, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimated damages from the derecho, which raced from Iowa to Indiana, at $7.5 billion. This includes agricultural impacts that still are being analyzed, so the total may be revised, said Adam Smith, who manages the database.

Between 2016 and 2018, the volume of assets invested responsibly grew by almost USD8 trillion. Impact investing was one of the fastest growing categories, up almost 80 per cent, but CAMRADATA notes that this only amounts to less than USD200 million in monetary terms. Other forms of responsible investing, such as ESG Integration and Screening are worth USD17.4 trillion and USD19.8 trillion in assets under management, respectively. “Impact investing firmly stands on the shoulders of ESG. Impact is the next step. Impact investing is being part of the solution for example defined by the Sustainable Development Goals. If you want it in black and white: ESG is more about doing no harm while Impact is focused on doing good,” says Marjoleine van der Peet, portfolio manager of Kempen’s Global Impact Pool, at CAMRADATA’s roundtable.",AON,en,InstitutionAlassetManager

2020-02-27 10:11:55-05:00,Billionaire Ken Griffin Pulls the Trigger on These 3 “Strong Buy” Stocks,"While the economy is booming, there are some warnings signs starting to flash. Hedge fund manager Ken Griffin – who started trading at age 19, and now at 51 has amassed a fortune worth $15 billion – spoke about some of the near- and long-term risks in a recent interview. Griffin sees inflation as a danger in the longer term, mostly because the financial experts lack tools to determine when inflationary trends are starting. Griffin recounts how his firm’s best analysts were caught flat-footed in 2018 when the Fed started raising rates. Regarding the lack of accurate predictive foresight, Griffin says, “If there were inflation, the markets are utterly and completely unprepared for that.” But inflation, being invisible for now, is a long-term worry. Griffin sees the coronavirus outbreak has a larger threat, at least for the present. Griffin notes that a number of major companies – Apple is a particularly good example – have already announced lower Q4 and Q1 earnings, disrupted supply chains, and even store closings in response to the viral epidemic as it expands out of China.",AON,en,Nasdaq
