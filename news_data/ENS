OutBack will work with Bay City Electric Works, a distributor of generators made by bath and faucet giant Kohler, to sell the systems throughout California and Nevada, as the companies vie to win a slice of a growing market focused on resilience amid power outages. Unlike many solar and storage companies pitching customers on backup power, OutBack is including fossil fuels, which it says will optimize the system and allow it to more effectively handle greater loads. “Our products have pretty much since the beginning enabled customers to connect a generator to them. In the off-grid world, that’s really not optional — you have to do that because there’s going to be times where there simply isn’t sufficient solar resource for the loads you need to run,” said Paul Dailey, OutBack’s director of product and market strategy. “What we’re doing in this instance is bringing that to the backup scenario.” Since its founding, Arizona-based OutBack has focused on hardware that can withstand harsh environments.",ENS,en,Green Technology Media
