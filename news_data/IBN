This is a move in the right direction.Both theory and evidence reveal that compared to real sector business units, banks are more vulnerable to contagious shocks, the impact of which is much more pervasive and pernicious. Three new-generation banks — Times Bank, Bank of Punjab and Centurion Bank — which were established during the 1990s, were to be soon deregistered because their losses couldn’t be cushioned by their thin capital base. So, capital, especially equity capital, plays a crucial role of loss absorbency in banks. Capital-based licensing also complements capital-based regulation and supervision (read: Basel 3) by the central bank, which is the order of the day worldwide.While PSBs are being consolidated to provide a chunk of India’s capital requirement, their efforts need to be supplemented by resources from private banks.",IBN,en,Economic Times India

Borrowers who opted for the relief now face an even bigger burden. Banks might restructure loans, but won’t waive the interest dues. They are now more picky about who they lend to. Many borrowers might find that even if their credit score was intact, lenders are not entertaining their loan requests or charging a much higher rate of interest.Those with multiple loans will particularly feel the pinch.

2020-09-11 00:53:24-05:00,Why Reliance valuations may not be sustainable,"eliance’s ROE is in single digits and a story is getting built here because valuation is getting ascribed by private investors, says the analyst, asksandipsabharwal.com. The profit of Reliance is not double that of TCS and HDFC Bank put together, but the market cap is. What do you think?It has been driven by people not knowing how to value a particular stock and that is happening in many technology stocks in the US also. People do not know how to figure out the actual valuation of the Jio platform and that is leading to this sort of valuation change. In fact, over the last 10 years, Reliance has not generated free cash flows in even a single year. When you compare it to companies like TCS or HDFC Bank or any other company which has a high ROE, Reliance’s ROE is in single digits. There is a story that is getting built because valuation is getting ascribed by private investors. The future returns depend on execution. They need to execute and they need to generate cash flows because without cash flows, I do not think the valuations will be sustainable.",IBN,en,Economic Times India

The access to money for SBI is a no-brainer, it is just that the market’s pessimism on PSUs is unfounded. A fair value for me for State Bank should be at least Rs 250.

The intriguing stock for me today is Bharti. There is nothing wrong with the numbers but ever since the promoter stake sale has happened, the stock is down. Today also the stock should have been 3% higher, but it is 4% lower.Yes exactly. When management sells to institutional investors, most stocks tend to find a bottom near that price. However, for Bharti, it has acted more like a stop for the stock like it has found it very tough to cross that and the stock remained below that level. This could be partly because so much investment has gone into Jio and they have continued to gain new subscribers, while Bharti and Vodafone have lost subscribers. The problem with many of the over-owned stocks, especially where stake sales happen is that as and when these euphoric ETF flows reverse, we will see selling in them in a similar manner as we saw buying.

What has been your take away on ICICI numbers?ICICI Bank results on a reported basis were pretty strong in terms of net interest margins. They have made good provisions for potential Covid losses as well. So the overall loan book and capital adequacy ratio continue to be pretty strong. They sustained gains in some of the segments of growth and retail is now almost 60% of the book. So we are seeing an inversion now where HDFC from being 60% retail is now around 43% whereas ICICI is more retail. This should help in the bank’s valuations.

How have you looked at the headline numbers?The numbers are pretty strong. If you look at it from a core operating performance perspective, keeping aside non-recurring one time income as well as the one time provisioning, the numbers were pretty strong and they have beaten our estimates for core pre-operating profit margins by about 15% odd. That is a significant beat and they have very prudently utilised the large treasury gains coming from the selling stake in insurance subsidiaries by significantly augmenting their provisioning for Covid which now stands at about 1.3% of the overall loan book, thereby further cushioning the balance sheet to a significant extent and providing a comfort to investors now.",IBN,en,Economic Times India

To further improve its margin of safety, HDFC Bank and Kotak have much higher capital ratios and to be better prepared to capitalize on potential growth opportunities as the economy stabilizes amid weak competition. During its F4Q20 results conference call, the bank had mentioned that while its capital position is comfortable (CET 1 ratio at 13.4 per cent), it would look for opportunities to strengthen its balance sheet further.

The outlook on the Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) was revised to negative from stable due to the banks' high dependence on the Centre to re-capitalise them. Accordingly, the IDR outlook of the Export-Import Bank of India, the State Bank of India, the Bank of Baroda, the Bank of Baroda (New Zealand), the Bank of India, the Canara Bank, the Punjab National Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank Ltd have been downgraded to negative. ""At the same time, Fitch has affirmed IDBI Bank Limited's (IDBI) IDR while maintaining the outlook at negative,"" Fitch said in a statement. The rating actions follow Fitch's revision of the outlook on the 'BBB-' rating on India to negative from stable on June 18, due to the impact of the escalating coronavirus pandemic on India's economy. ""The IDRs for all the above Indian banks are support-driven and anchored to their respective SRFs,"" the statement said. ""They are based on Fitch's assessment of high to moderate probability of extraordinary state support for these banks, which takes into account our assessment of the sovereign's ability and propensity to provide extraordinary support.""

In a recent response to a Right to Information query, the Reserve Bank of India , the Indian central bank, has stated that there is no prohibition on banks to provide bank accounts to cryptocurrency traders. But some banks have been arbitrarily denying services to crypto users and are still doing so. If there is no law banning crypto trading, as emphasized by India’s Supreme Court , and there is no prohibition on banks by the RBI, then why aren’t banks treating crypto-related activities on par with other legitimate activities? The RBI banking ban on crypto was set aside by the Supreme Court on March 4, 2020. In its detailed judgement of over 180 pages, the Supreme Court stated that the RBI action is extremely disproportionate in severing the lifeline (banking services) for cryptocurrency trading business despite crypto trading not being illegal under any Indian law and no harm or damage is proved to have been caused to these banks as a result of their relationship with crypto exchanges.",IBN,en,Cointelegraph

Certain other domestic sectors will also drive growth, but selectively,” Prabhudas Lilladher said.The domestic brokerage expects HDFC Bank, India’s most valuable lender, to see a revival in loan growth after a slowdown in the previous quarter, whereas it believes Axis Bank and ICICI Bank would post ‘steady’ growth rates.Profits of some public-sector banks with higher gross Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) are likely to be impacted as lenders would look to synchronise their Deferred Tax Assets (DTAs) with newly prescribed tax rates.At present, every bank must provide or provision for stressed loans.",IBN,en,The Economic Times India

We were vindicated yet again last week by the collapse of Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank.This bank violated all lending norms to channel no less than 70% of its entire loans (Rs 6,500 crore) to just one client — Housing Development and infrastructure Ltd (HDIL), owned by the Wadhawan family. When HDIL went bust, so (after attempts to hide the damage) did the bank.PMC Bank was, in effect, captured by the Wadhawans and milked dry.

Banks with huge DTAs on their books have reached out to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to synchronise its provisioning norms with the recently-announced tax rates. Banks are hoping RBI prescribes a methodology so they can write these off over next three to five years. Banks fear that reinstating DTAs at one go could impact their net worth, or even earnings per share (EPS). The problem is especially acute for banks and NBFCs that have high non-performing assets (NPA) or stressed loans. At present, every bank has to provide or provision for stressed loans. However, for taxation, a different percentage for the same loans is prescribed. This creates a mismatch wherein many banks get a balance DTA on the asset side. “Banks with huge NPAs on their books will have to provide for that.

That may present a dilemma for India’s central bank, analysts said.The rupee is emerging as Asia’s top performer in the past three months, thanks to the gush of foreign cash.

For ICICI Bank, the upward move has been even sharper — to 80.60% from 60.40% a year earlier.PCRs for Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, RBL Bank and also state-owned banks such as Canara Bank and Bank of India have also climbed.PCR is the ratio of provisioning to gross non-performing assets and indicates the extent of funds a bank has kept aside to cover loan losses.A 100% PCR means that a bank has set aside 100% of doubtful loans to cover eventual losses.Analysts said higher PCR is also related to higher provisions banks may have had to take for NPAs that have aged.“Banks have taken additional provisions during the quarter on ageing related NPAs and also in a few cases, 100% provisions on some NCLT accounts.",IBN,en,The Economic Times India

Chinese and European banks are very large, there are benefits they derive from economies of scale, which reduces their costs. American and Chinese banks benefit from global savings.The Finance Ministry has been saying that India needs fewer and mega banks. The ministry had earlier called for further consolidation of India's banking industry, saying the country needs fewer, stronger mega lenders to exploit economies of scale.The reasoning of the NDA government behind such consolidation has been to drive synergies, reducing duplication and generate savings.Taking that line of action forward, state-run Bank of Baroda (BoB) became India's third largest bank after its merger with Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank came into effect from April 1, 2019, beating the private sector lender ICICI Bank.",IBN,en,The Economic Times India

The diet did the trick for Kanoria, who works out regularly. SIFL, the Kolkata-based infrastructure-focused non-banking financial company (NBFC) founded by the Kanoria family, is also on a diet of sorts. It is trying to re-shape its Rs 50,000 crore asset book (total loans advanced) and is avoiding any further infrastructure project financing. The year 2018 was a nightmare for the SIFL stock. Its market capitalisation dropped by almost 66%.

Developers are not sensitive to our hard work. There are many people who had to leave the trade,” said Ravinder Aggarwal, the association’s president.In some cases, the delay in payment has been up to five years, according to ACRI, which said it now takes a minimum of three to six months to receive payments from builders once the deal is concluded, compared with 30 days earlier.“Once 10% payment is received from the buyer, the developers have to pay brokerage to the brokers,” said Ashwin Chawwla, CEO of Trustmore Technologies, the company that helps home buyers use an escrow account in a tieup with ICICI Bank and Axis Bank.",IBN,en,The Economic Times India

Co-founder and former chief operating officer (COO)-turned ‘gardener’ at Mindtree, Subroto Bagchi’s recent tweets attacking Larsen & Toubro (L&T) as a bunch of marauders arriving at the gates of Mindtree’s Eden with “bulldozers and saw chains” to mow it all down “so that in its place, they can build a shopping mall” is rather imperious, contemptuous and derisive.As L&T’s leadership retorted, “We have bulldozers, we have cranes, we make things that make the nation proud. We make submarines, rockets, missiles and guns. We are a national company.” Any self-respecting professional would tend to agree with that last statement.So, what’s the din all about in the first place? Corporate takeovers are as commonplace as the potholes on Mumbai’s roads. Hostile ones are a rare breed in India, but that too is normal corporate evolution.",IBN,en,The Economic Times India

2019-03-18 04:39:02-05:00,Arcelor a step closer to winning Essar bout,"In a big win for ArcelorMittal, National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) today allowed implementation of ArcelorMittal's Rs 42,000 crore resolution plan for Essar Steel sale subject to final order. However according to some reports, Essar may challenge the order in the Supreme Court. National Company Law Appellate Tribunal on Friday had refused to stay National Company Law Tribunal's (NCLT) Ahmedabad bench order approving steel giant ArcelorMittal's Rs 42,000 crore takeover bid for Essar Steel and sought had a fresh plan for the distribution of bid amount between financial and operational creditors of the debt-laden firm.NCLAT two-judge bench had earlier asked creditors to consider giving operational creditors 10 per cent of the total proceeds, up from 5 per cent considered in the agreed plan. The bench also asked lenders to consider giving Standard Chartered more of the dues than what is proposed now, suggesting a pro rata formula be applied for all financial creditors. Four creditors with the largest exposures, namely Edelweiss ARC, State Bank of India, IDBI Bank and ICICI Bank, are part of the core committee that is taking the call on the behalf of lenders as the committee of creditors (CoC) has been technically dissolved after a decision to award the bid to ArcelorMittal was taken.Essar Steel directors had challenged Ahmedabad-bench of NCLT nod to global steel giant ArcelorMittal's bid for the debt-laden company on the plea that their offer of Rs 54,389-crore was superior as it clears 100 per cent outstanding of both financial and operational creditors.Standard Chartered too moved the NCLAT against the plan as its counsel contended that the bank was being given only 1.7 per cent of its total dues from Essar Steel while other financial creditors, forming part of the CoC, were getting over 85 per cent of their dues.ArcelorMittal's Resolution Proposal involves financial creditors getting Rs 41,987 crore out of their total dues of Rs 49,395 crore.",IBN,en,The Economic Times India

The options include asking ArcelorMittal to pay up the whole amount and keep the contentious payments to operational creditors in an escrow account or just comply with the suggestions made by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in the last hearing on Friday. “The third option is to stick to our stand that this is the agreed resolution and fight on, assuming further delays. All these options are being debated but there is no consensus as yet,” said a banker with knowledge of the internal discussions. Lenders, especially those owned by the state, are under pressure to accept any solution suggested by NCLAT because they are desperate to close the long-pending case before the fiscal year ends . Meeting that deadline will allow them to write back against earlier provisions and escape higher ageingrelated provisions for the account.",IBN,en,The Economic Times India
