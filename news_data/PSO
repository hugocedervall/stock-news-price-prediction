New data from London-based equity research firm Ortex Analytics shows almost three-quarters of total short losses in August came from big wagers against just five names: Ocado Group, InterContinental Hotels, International Consolidated Airlines Group, BHP and Pearson. Together, they accounted for a bruising GBP310 million loss out of a total hit of GBP420 million to hedge fund short sellers last month. As UK equities gained ground towards the end of the summer, hedge funds made gains from short positions in just a third of FTSE 100 names - 32 companies out of the total 100 in the index – as negative wagers in all sectors ultimately went awry.

2020-07-27 11:53:32-05:00,Why It's A Mistake to Assume There Will Be A Long Term Boost For Online Education Providers,"When everything from kindergarten to college went online this spring, pundits and investors alike predicted major upside for the companies that create and sell online learning products and services – companies such as Pearson plc (NYSE: PSO ), 2U Inc (NASDAQ: TWOU ), and K12 Inc. (NYSE: LRN ). For the most part, they have been right. The latter two of those stocks have more than tripled since March, as online learning demand has opened both doors and eyes. For investors, the short-term trade has worked out. But the long term picture doesn't look as rosey. In evaluating companies that provide education services to schools, the first rule is to remember the sales in education is long—often years long—and very complicated. It can even take as long to onboard a new customer/school as it did to win the deal in the first place. Solutions and business deals in this space flow like tectonic plates, nearly impervious to need or demand. In other words, open doors may not result in new deals for a very, very long time.",PSO,en,Benzinga

Wind was the big winner: onshore projects that started construction in 2016 and 2017 will now have five rather than four years to finish projects, while still receiving production tax credit (PTC) benefits. But solar developers got some help too, with the IRS allowing for investment tax credit-qualified equipment bought in 2019 to be delivered into October and providing added assurance that developers will receive benefits as long as they have “reasonable” expectation that equipment will be delivered in the required timeframe. The guidance, requested by members of Congress and encouraged by the clean energy industry, should offer developers comfort as they recover from extended coronavirus-related shutdowns. With the PTC set to step down, the wind industry was scrambling to put about 15 gigawatts into service before the calendar turned to January.","PTC,PSO",en,Green Technology (Feed)

2019-08-04 08:34:38-05:00,An airport may end up costing Modi his $5 mn economy dream,"MUMBAI: Global logistics major DHL Express is concerned about lack of adequate infrastructure at the city airport, warning this may be detrimental to the country's $5-trillion growth aspiration as well. The company said there is only a single slot for all air freight operators and there is no scope for expansion at the nations second largest airport. Anywhere where there are restrictions of slots for landing or network to be able to build our network in terms of services which we are able to give our customers, be it exports or imports, global chief executive John Pearson told here. Managing director for India RS Subramanian said all the other major airports in the country have dedicated space allotted for operators like it, but despite privatisation, the Mumbai airport lacks the same. If India says it will be from a USD 5 trillion economy by 2025, trade will have to grow and international trade will have been to grow manifold. And trade will not grow without the support which companies like DHL can provide, Subramanian said.",PSO,en,The Economic Times India
2019-08-03 12:30:00-05:00,DHL Express plans to take India to the world,"Soon after Ken Allen handed the baton of DHL Express to long-time colleague John Pearson in January, he wrote in the Harvard Business Review: “His [Pearson’s] singing voice is better than mine!”During the global financial crisis in 2008, DHL Express, an arm of German mail & logistics multinational Deutsche Post DHL Group, had started a turnaround process. This meant resizing its US business and letting go of thousands of employees. To keep up the morale in those hard times, Allen, then CEO, used music in a big way in internal communication and would even sing at employee meets.Now, Pearson, the new CEO, is also the company’s singer-in-chief. Ask him about it, and the 56-year-old Briton breaks into a song by Bob Seger: “Simplicity it works for me/ It keeps me runnin’ hard, and sharp and true…”Under Pearson, DHL Express, too appears to be “runnin hard, sharp and true” towards India’s small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as these companies enter faroff markets by relying on ecommerce. Up to 70% of the company’s business in India comes from SMEs.In an interview with ET Magazine during his first visit to India as the company’s CEO, Pearson says: “Global trade is too big to fail.” 70515143 For every move like Brexit or the US-China trade war, there would be 70 to 80 protrade talks and deals happening at the same time, he says.",PSO,en,The Economic Times India
