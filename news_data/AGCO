Gilardi cut his rating to underperform from neutral and slashed his stock price target to $64 from $75. Gilardi said Agco's stock outperformance has been based on Agco's relative lack of North America large agriculture exposure as the U.S.-China trade war drags on, continued strong performance of its European business and a heavy short position by investors in late 2018.
