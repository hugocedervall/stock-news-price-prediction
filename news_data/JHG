""Asset manager M&A wave will continue with a variety of potential transactions,"" analysts at Credit Suisse led by Craig Siegenthaler wrote to clients on Thursday. The evening before, Australia-based Macquarie Group said it would acquire investment manager Waddell & Reed.

Greg King, CEO of REX, explains that the inflow of assets is largely into their inverse and leveraged MicroSectors ETPs based on the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google). The firm partnered with Bank of Montreal to offer leveraged and inverse products and the first suite was the FANG+ suite. “They resonate with investors, especially in 2020 when one of the FAANG stocks will always be topical,” King says. “It’s been a great space to be in and we are the only one with a FAANG-based product.” Leveraged and inverse ETPs receive some criticism within the investment industry which fears investors do not always understand the risks they are taking.

Tyler Durden Tue, 10/20/2020 - 17:05 While we have previously reported - and by now it is common knowledge - that Covid-19 usually kills only the very old with virtually no deaths in the 45 and under category and most deaths in the 75 and over category. Indeed, as Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid noted when discussing the average age of fatalities from Covid, ""it is remarkably consistent around the 80-82 year old mark."" Then overnight, Bloomberg's John Authers pointed out how startling this mortality rate varies from country to country, when referencing another chart from Jim Reid: As Authers writes, ""The U.S. is a remarkable outlier. How can that possibly be?"" According to Reid, a small part of this might be down to many of the other countries having an older population. For example, Italy’s median age is 45 (43 in Europe), whereas it is 38 for the US. However, another explanation offered by the Bloomberg commentator, which feeds into the political debate of the moment, ""is that all the other developed countries on this chart have some form of universal state-provided healthcare.""

This month, US investment bank Morgan Stanley revealed plans to buy investment manager Eaton Vance, in a move that will almost double its assets under management to USD1.2 trillion. “Eaton Vance is a perfect fit for Morgan Stanley,” said James P Gorman, chairman and chief executive officer of Morgan Stanley, at the time of the announcement. Gorman explained that Morgan Stanley sees it as an opportunity to add more fee-based revenues and boost assets under management. Bing Waldert, managing director of US research at asset management research firm Cerulli Associates, says investment managers are looking to gain greater market share as their profits come under increasing threat. “The overarching theme is continued compression of fees in the asset management marketplace,” says Waldert. “At a top line, that means the revenue that an asset manager is able to raise, but as you start to dig deeper, it's also about costs in a stricter regulatory environment.” Allocators are “looking to engage with fewer partners on a deeper level”, which means their expectations for asset manager relationships are going up, and the fees they expect to pay are going down.",JHG,en,InstitutionAlassetManager

In the UK, financial services industry body The City UK estimates that businesses may build up GBP100 billion of debt by next March which they would be unable to repay, with 780,000 SMEs in danger of insolvency. A global forecast by fund manager Janus Henderson for overall corporate debt predicts a jump to a record USD9.3 trillion in 2020. Jub Hurren, senior portfolio manager of AIMS Fixed Income at Aviva Investors, says that many companies won’t fail immediately, thanks to supportive monetary policy: “The fact that interest rates are going to stay at extremely low levels means that even companies with low earnings can probably survive longer than they would otherwise because of the reduced burden in terms of servicing debt.” These low rates have also allowed company debt piles to grow. “What we have seen in Europe is an increasing portion of corporates who have interest coverage ratios (the relationship between the EBIT and the interest expense) below one.",JHG,en,InstitutionAlassetManager

2019-03-04 14:45:00-05:00,Bill Gross: Algos Making It Much Harder For Active Managers To Generate Alpha,"Amid the barrage of shocking revelations from an interview with Bloomberg News last week, Bill Gross's comment about how he doesn't expect another 'bond king' to succeed him upon his retirement was probably easy to overlook. To be fair, some would argue that there already is another 'bond king' (DoubleLine Capital's Jeffrey Gundlach is often cited as an heir to Gross's title ). But in the second part of the legendary bond investor and Pimco founder's interview, he offered a more complete explanation of what he meant by this. Since quantitative traders came to dominate financial markets, there have been fewer opportunities for their human rivals to generate alpha, Gross said. As algos became more efficient at eliminating arbitrage opportunities, picking up what Gross called ""structural alpha"" - something that once allowed savvy bond traders to easily beat their benchmarks by 30 or 40 basis points - has become much more difficult. ""There are things to look at that still exist in the market that can generate alpha, although the probabilities of generating historical alpha in the same way are much less than they were,"" Gross, who retired on March 1 after a 48-year career in financial markets, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Newport Beach, California.",JHG,en,Zero Hedge
