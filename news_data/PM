Today, as the vaping lung injury crisis worsens , people are still coming up with new smoking alternatives. One is a salt-based formulation. Visit Insider's homepage for more stories. For thousands of years, people have been enjoying the subtle rush that smoking tobacco leaves, thereby ingesting nicotine, can provide. But it wasn't until about 220 years ago that doctors started realizing how harmful smoking can be. Dr. Benjamin Rush was one of the first to point this out, in 1798, calling smoking ""offensive"" and a-moral, while also suggesting, correctly, that it can prompt ""incurable diseases"" and cancers.

Rose was the first person to develop a nicotine patch, and he also pioneered an e-cig that he said was ""a bit too far ahead of its time,"" and never made it to market. Rose's research shows many smokers aren't satisfied with patches or pills, and need something to see and feel when they're trying to quit .

Visit Insider's homepage for more stories. You could say that Jed Rose has spent his entire career — his entire life, even — trying to get people to smoke fewer cigarettes. Rose's father died at 47 of smoking-related heart disease. Then, as a post-doc at UCLA, Rose became fascinated with how millions of people, like his own dad, could become cripplingly addicted to a drug that ""doesn't get people visibly high.""
