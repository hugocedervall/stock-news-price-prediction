As a reminder, while the Fed pre-announced its intention to purchase up to $750BN in corporate bond (including certain fallen-angel junk bonds) in March, it started purchasing bonds in May, and bond ETFs in June (among which such mainstays as LQD and HYG). By directly entering the corporate bond market - something none of his predecessors dared to do even at the depths of the financial crisis - Powell created what many believe, as GLJ's Gordon Johnson writes, ""the biggest corporate bond bubble, and junk bond bubble, in history (and that all happened before the Fed even started buying).""

The CEO of a $3 billion asset manager reveals a decade-long trend that's boosting utilities — and shares his 3 top picks.,"The utilities sector has long been considered a haven for investors in uncertain times. In the next 5 to 10 years, utilities will benefit from cheap solar panels and wind turbines, according to Jay Rhame, who runs a $3 billion asset management firm. Rhame values growth over outright yield and favors companies with management teams that are skilled at cost control. He shares three of his top picks including NextEra Energy, CMS Energy, and Eversource. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . When cash is tight, you might not buy a new summer wardrobe or purchase a sports car, but chances are you'll still pay your bill for electricity, gas, and water. That's one reason why utility companies are seen as havens for investors in times of market uncertainty. Plus, many utilities are protected by government regulations and pay investors hefty dividends. But for Jay Rhame, who helms a $3 billion long-only asset management firm, utilities are not just about safety. They're also about growth. ""We're really excited about the utility sector,"" said Rhame, the chief executive of Reaves Asset Management, a firm focused on investing in essential services that's headquartered in Jersey City, New Jersey. ""The potential to remake almost the entire global electric grid and transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy is potentially a decades-long trend that will benefit utilities.""
