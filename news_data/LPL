2020-11-24 06:50:58-05:00,iPad Pro to receive two major display upgrades next year,"According to a new report from Korea, Apple is working on two iPad Pro display upgrades for 2021. Apple will release an iPad Pro with a mini-LED display in the first half of the year, followed by an iPad Pro with an OLED screen in the second half. Samsung Display and LG Display are currently developing OLED panels for the iPad Pro. Apple released updated iPad Pro versions in early 2020, well before the arrival of the A14 Bionic chip and 5G connectivity. Many expected Apple to issue a new iPad Pro refresh that would offer buyers access to its fastest, most efficient processor so far and bring 5G support to the best possible iPad version. But that hasn’t happened. Apple released a new iPad Air version a few months ago that does feature the same processor as the iPhone 12 devices. Rumors recently said that Apple is also working on a major display update for the iPad Pro. A new report from Korea indicates that Apple might be readying two distinct screen upgrades for the iPad Pro. Both devices should launch in 2021.",LPL,en,BGR

According to TheElec , OBE is still facing manufacturing issues at its Chengdu plant in Sichuan province, meaning the display maker has failed to secure Apple's validation for the OLED screens for the second time this year. BOE's plant in Mianyang – in the same province – suffered the same fate in June , due to a low production yield rate of around 20 percent. Apple's review for Chengdu began in September but only lasted a month and ended in failure in October, according to the report. BOE will now have to wait until the first half of 2021 to reattempt to clinch a supply deal, which means next year's iPhone series will likely use panels made by Samsung and LG Display. BOE will now have to wait until between May and June before it learns the results of its third review. If it does pass, the panels it supplies will be able to be used for refurbished iPhone 12 models.",LPL,en,Mac Rumors

2020-11-12 21:12:12-05:00,iPhone 13 Pro leak reveals the phone’s most important upgrade,"Apple is reportedly bringing its LTPO display technology to the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max. Low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) technology allows for more power-efficient displays, which means the next iPhone models might have better battery life. LTPO technology also opens the door to 120Hz refresh rates and always-on displays. Now that the iPhone 12 has been out for more than 24 hours, it's time to move on iPhone 13 leaks. Apple was once a bastion of secrecy in the world of technology, but in recent years, the company has rarely made it to a major hardware reveal event with any hardware left to actually reveal. The same will likely be true of the iPhone 13 series in 2021, as we are already getting hints about some of the upgrades Apple has in store for the new phones. According to a recent report from the Korean electronics blog The Elec , Apple is planning to bring OLED displays with low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) technology to multiple iPhone models in 2021. ""LG Display will expand the production rate of its organic light emitting diode (OLED) panel factory lines dedicated to Apple,"" the Elec report says.

2020-11-10 05:45:19-05:00,Report: 'iPhone 13 Pro' Models to Feature Low-Power LTPO Display Technology,"Apple will adopt OLED displays with low-power LPTO backplane technology for at least two iPhone models in 2021, according to Korean website The Elec . From the report: LG Display will expand the production rate of its organic light emitting diode (OLED) panel factory lines dedicated to Apple, TheElec has learned. LG Display is planning to put in low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LPTO) thin-film transistors (TFT) equipment that can add 25,000 substrates per month in monthly production rate into the lines by next year. The LTPO equipment being placed in the factory lines will be for OLED panel supply to ‌iPhone‌ next year, while the ones after May will likely be for panels for iPhones of 2022. LTPO technology would result in a more power efficient backplane, which is responsible for turning individual pixels on and off on the display. The technology could pave the way for longer battery life and/or new features like ProMotion or always-on display elements. Display analyst Ross Young believes that LTPO is essential if Apple plans to support ProMotion in a future ‌iPhone‌, as it would allow for a variable refresh as low as 1Hz when the device is inactive in order to optimize battery life.",LPL,en,Mac Rumors

Kuo has said the mini-LED displays will "" significantly improve productivity and the entertainment experience ,"" and has previously said that mini-LED displays will allow for thinner and lighter product designs, while offering many of the same benefits of OLED displays used on the latest iPhones, including higher contrast ratio, higher brightness, and deeper blacks.

2019-11-13 05:13:32-05:00,"16-inch MacBook Pro Has Improved Speakers, Noise-Cancelling Microphones, and '4% Larger' Screen Than 15.4-inch Model","Following yesterday's report on Apple's new 16-inch MacBook Pro which could be announced as soon as Wednesday, Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman this morning shared some additional details about the upcoming machine via Twitter. According to Gurman , the display on the new ‌MacBook Pro‌ is less than four percent larger than the current 15.4-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌, suggesting to him that ""it's really going to be about the higher resolution"" rather than a material increase in screen real estate. Gurman offers no clues as to the exact resolution, but reliable IHS Markit analyst Jeff Lin claimed in June that the 16-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌ would feature an LCD panel with a resolution of 3,072×1,920 pixels supplied by LG Display. For comparison, the 15-inch ‌‌MacBook Pro‌‌ has a resolution of 2,880×1,800 pixels. In addition, Gurman says the new 16-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌ will have ""impressive speakers"" and ""noise cancelling microphones,"" which sounds like a reference to an improved ambient noise reduction feature enabling users to capture less background noise when using the built-in microphones, thereby improving dictation and FaceTime calls.",LPL,en,Mac Rumors
