It's also marked a degree of outpeformance versus the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index, which has risen 33% in 2020. James' track record at the $10.2 billion Chicago-based Driehaus Capital Management is so compelling that the firm — founded in 1982 by famed momentum investor Richard Driehaus — launched another fund focused on small- and mid-cap stocks for him in May this year.

Bei Banken und Sparkassen gibt es so gut wie keine Zinsen, für größere Summen müssen Sparer teilweise sogar zahlen. Wer nicht in Aktien oder Gold investieren möchte, steckt sein Geld in Luxusgüter – warum also nicht in Uhren? Der Haken: Nur wenige Modelle bringen wirklich Geld. Ohne Marktkenntnis kann ein Investment schnell in die Hose gehen. Viele Uhren auf dem Markt werden ihren Wert nicht halten können, sagt Stefan Muser, Inhaber des Auktionshauses Dr. Crott in Mannheim. ""Im aktuellen Bereich – das was man so beim Juwelier kaufen kann – gibt es sehr sehr sehr wenige Modelle, bei denen ich ein Wertsteigerungspotenzial sehen würde."" ""Man kann es nur schätzen, aber 70 bis 80 Prozent der Uhren, selbst die hochwertigen Uhren aus der Schweiz und Glashütte, sind als Kapitalanlage ungeeignet"", sagt auch Michael Brückner, der sich als Autor jahrelang mit Uhren und anderen Luxusgütern auseinandergesetzt hat.",NLS,de,Volksstimme.de

It wasn’t that long ago that Instagram was flooded with saturated filters and low-resolution photos. But then the gaudy, maximalist look of the 2000s faded out of style, and was replaced with an interest in clean lines and mature color palettes. Seemingly overnight, the platform became an ode to minimalism—filled with interior design and lifestyle posts from influencers anchored by organic, nautilus-shaped forms and eggshell-colored walls. Everything on the grid was carefully curated to be monochromatic, uncluttered, and uniform. Read Full Story",NLS,en,Fast Company

2019-12-01 19:35:45-05:00,150 años de la llegada del Nautilus a la bahía de Vigo,"Corría la primera semana de 1869 cuando, en la revista quincenal francesa «Magasin d’Éducation et de Récréation« (de educación y recreo), se publicó el capítulo «La Bahía de Vigo», que forma parte de la novela «20.000 leguas de viaje submarino», de Jules Verne, considerándose además como uno de los más importantes en el desarrollo de la historia. En él, el escritor relata el momento en el que el capitán Nemo, a bordo del submarino Nautilus, llega a la ría viguesa para rescatar el tesoro de Rande, un botín que no se había encontrado hasta el momento. En esta escala de su viaje es donde, además, la embarcación recibe los cuartos con los que financiar su expedición. Con motivo de la celebración de este 150 aniversario, desde la sociedad viguesa que lleva por nombre al escritor francés, han decido recoger la versión original, con ilustraciones de Alphonse de Neuville, en una edición facsimilar, precisamente para «poder festejar este año tan conmemorativo», reconoce Julio Ástor, miembro de la junta directiva de la Sociedad Jules Verne en Vigo.",NLS,es,ABC

2019-05-15 01:35:13-05:00,Bronze Watches Age With Their Owners. Here Are Seven to Grow Old With,"(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- In 1988 watch designer Gérald Genta—the mastermind of Audemars Piguet’s Royal Oak and Patek Philippe’s Nautilus—unveiled the Gefica under his own company shingle. Eschewing a case of fancy gold or cheaper stainless steel, Genta chose bronze. It wasn’t a common timepiece material, being more frequently associated with a third-place medal or the advances of very early civilization. Today, alongside high-tech ceramics, future-forward carbon fiber, and technically superior titanium, bronze has become an alloy of choice for prominent and independent watch brands alike. The combination of copper and tin (or, alternately, aluminum) can quickly develop a patina, the earthy discoloration caused by copper oxidation. Since that patina will be slightly different for each wearer, bronze is “a living material,” says Ander Ugarte, Tudor SA’s head of design, changing over time depending on an owner’s experience. Bronze resists corrosion in seawater, which is why it has an illustrious history of use for ship hardware and housings for nautical clocks.",NLS,en,Bloomberg
