2020-11-26 22:05:00-05:00,Joe Biden: Return Of The CFR,"Joe Biden: Return Of The CFR Tyler Durden Thu, 11/26/2020 - 22:05 Submitted by Swiss Policy Research, A Joe Biden presidency means a “return to normality” simply because it means a return of the US Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). In 2008, Barack Obama received the names of his entire future cabinet already one month prior to his election by CFR Senior Fellow (and Citigroup banker) Michael Froman, as a Wikileaks email later revealed. Consequently, the key posts in Obama’s cabinet were filled almost exclusively by CFR members, as was the case in most cabinets since World War II. To be sure, Obama’s 2008 Republican opponent, the late John McCain, was a CFR member, too. Michael Froman later negotiated the TPP and TTIP international trade agreements, before returning to the CFR as a Distinguished Fellow. In 2017, CFR nightmare President Donald Trump immediately canceled these trade agreements – because he viewed them as detrimental to US domestic industry – which allowed China to conclude its own, recently announced RCEP free-trade area , encompassing 14 countries and a third of global trade.","CFR,CIA",en,Zero Hedge

2020-10-28 12:04:00-05:00,Can 2021 be even worse than 2020?,"The Kvadrat research centre shared the results of its new study devoted to most pressing threats that the world faces and fears most. Kvadrat experts analyzed similar studies conducted by Stratfor, IASPS and CFR - the largest and most authoritative think tanks in the Western world.Looking ahead, it is worth noting most of the fears are related to the threats of another major war, or there factors that may cause the new war to break out. One of the most relevant ""negative scenarios"" in Kvadrat's study is ""Destabilization and, possibly, an attempt to start a civil war in the United States after the 2020 elections.""Another most ""popular fear"" that was identified during the study is related to the stagnation of the world economy, global economic crisis in 2021 (a possibility of the cascading collapse of sectors of the world economy).This is quite logical, since quarantine measures around the world have already caused many economies to collapse, including the global economy on the whole. At the same time, it is absolutely unclear when this global economic decline is going to end, especially against the backdrop of the pandemic.",CFR,en,Pravda Report

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif issued some interesting statements on this subject Monday, saying of the 2015 nuclear deal previously brokered under Obama and his VP Biden, that Tehran will never renegotiate the deal even if Biden takes the White House . He said at a virtual Council on Foreign Relations event that Washington must immediately return to the JCPOA agreement ""without condition"" . Via Newsweek Biden has promised that he would re-adopt the agreement, thus reversing Trump's May 2018 pullout; however, he's previously added just enough nuance to worry Iran, saying this would be conditioned on Tehran returning into complete compliance with its regulations.",CFR,en,Zero Hedge

Meanwhile, Buckinghamshire's Gawcott Solar CIC has mobilised £14,000, and Wiltshire Wildlife Community Energy has also allocated an undisclosed amount to local food banks.
