I talked to her about how Samsung’s view of mobile user experiences has changed over the years, and about the considerations that were top of mind when the user experience team at Samsung started to think about foldable designs. Hong is a 25-year veteran of the user-experience industry. Prior to joining Samsung, she gained experience in consumer devices and mobile platforms at BlackBerry, Adobe, and Sun. In her career, she has seen smartphones grow to become the most popular and essential consumer electronics product around the world. Precisely because smartphones are so widespread, she says, thinking about user experience has to be done in such a way that it accommodates a vast range of abilities. “There are certain key functions in a device that every single person uses, like making phone calls and messaging,” Hong says. “These should be as easy as possible because even your grandma is going to use these features.",BB,en,Fast Company

No stock goes up in perpetuity. It might be easy to look at the red-hot runs of shares that double and triple in a year or two and think the good times will last forever. But longtime BlackBerry ( BB ) shareholders likely wish they had taken some off the top after the stock's 500% run in the late aughts. Ask JCPenney and Sears shareholders whether it was worth holding until the bitter end. Yes, Warren Buffett will tell you ""our favorite holding period is forever,"" but just because it's his favorite holding period doesn't mean he lives and dies by buy-and-hold. For every American Express ( AXP ) that he holds for several decades, there's an American Airlines ( AAL ) that he ditched in just a few years.

The Android and iOS duo needed only a few years to “kill” Nokia, Palm, BlackBerry, and Microsoft, and Android ended up winning the lion's share of the market. But just because Google owns close to 90% share of the world’s mobile market doesn’t mean its app ecosystem is more profitable than Apple’s for the developers who make all those apps. But it turns out that’s not necessarily Google’s biggest problem with Android. The US government’s ban on Huawei, which may be soon upgraded to prevent Huawei’s access to additional tech products, might turn out to backfire in the most spectacular way, and Google is the company that will suffer as a result. Google has designed Android in such a way that it quickly became a no-brainer for smartphone vendors.

In early January, companies at the CES 2020 displayed their plans for making use of the surprising amounts of data gathered by newer model vehicles. Amazon, Intel, Qualcomm, and Blackberry were among the companies seeking partnerships with automakers who are also searching for methods to monetize the data gathered by their vehicles. Bloomberg reports that “modern cars roll out of factories packed with cellular connections, powerful processors and growing suite of sensors, including cameras, radar and microphones. That’s turning them into the next information goldmine, rivaling the data-creating capabilities of smartphones.” Bloomberg also notes that Intel announced a new stage of its Mobileye technology which allows for driver-assistance and Intel to gather data from cameras, chips, and sensors within the vehicle.",BB,en,Zero Hedge

In fact, neither smartphone operating system has quite the stronghold on the global smartphone market that the Symbian OS had. Platforms like Symbian, Windows Mobile, and even earlier versions of the BlackBerry operating system dominated the industry — yes, seriously, there was a point in time when BlackBerry had a decent share of the market. Those days are long gone, however, because the iPhone and Android completely turned the industry on its head. There are a number of reasons that iOS and Android were able to not just dominate earlier smartphone platforms, these new mobile OSes completely destroyed them.

Increasingly, it has less to do with consumer electronics – having morphed into areas like healthcare and automobiles. At the show, you not only get a sense of where technology advancement is now, but where it is going, both by listening to the announcements and by viewing the prototypes of products that may be months or years away – if they ever show up at all. At this year’s CES, it was clear that much of what we saw needed cloud service to make it fully functional. From ever smarter personal robots to health monitoring hardware to entertainment devices that connect to streaming services, the cloud enabled their hybrid use. Even automobiles were showcased as not only needing to talk to each other and pedestrians (because too many of us walk with our heads in our smartphones), but to the cloud to manage updates, patches, and better security.",BB,en,ComputerWorld

Samsung was smart enough to recognize this while other smartphone companies like Nokia and BlackBerry just shrugged it off, which is why those companies' smartphone businesses have completely collapsed. Rather than try to swim against the tide, Samsung decided to take a different route: The company's executives made a conscious decision to blatantly copy the iPhone as closely as possible. You've undoubtedly seen this topic debated ad nauseam by fanboys all across tech blogs and social media. Remove emotion from the equation, however, and you can't argue with facts — Samsung literally wrote a secret book for its engineers explaining how they should copy the iPhone pixel by pixel .

Just ask BlackBerry Ltd (NYSE: BB ) investors back in 2010 where they hoped the company would be in 2020. Here are a few bold predictions for what investors can expect in the next 10 years. 1. The U.S. cannabis boom will finally arrive. The U.S. political tide related to cannabis finally appears to be turning, with the latest poll from Pew Research suggesting that even a majority (55%) of Republican voters support federal legalization.

Apple revolutionized the mobile industry with the iPhone, and every other phone maker had to copy the new smartphone concept or die trying something else. Samsung chose to rip off the original iPhone's design and user interface, and it built a massive mobile empire in the process. In contrast, many others vanished — the list includes Nokia, Palm, BlackBerry, Microsoft, and what was left of Nokia after it was acquired by Microsoft. Samsung and Apple settled all their patent lawsuits after years of bickering, and both sides ended up winning. Samsung may have had to pay penalties to Apple, but those sums were inconsequential to Samsung’s bottom line.

Bottles from the northern region account for around half of all the money the British spend on Spanish wine each year, and its traditional stylistic template of oaky mellowness still shapes what many of us expect from the country’s red wines. The most coveted Spanish wine bodega of all, however, is not in Rioja. That credit belongs – as it has done for around 150 years – to Vega Sicilia, a single estate in Ribera del Duero to the west of Rioja, whose trio of superb ageworthy reds, but particularly Unico and Reserva Especial, attract top-Bordeaux (three and four-figure) prices. Until recently, the fame of Vega Sicilia dwarfed that of the region itself; but over the past 30 years, Ribera has emerged as a real challenger to the Rioja hegemony, thanks to wines ofdepth and silky polish, such as Cilar de Silos’ immaculate crianza.",BB,en,The Guardian

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. As global smartphone shipments continues to decline, Apple has dropped to fourth place in the worldwide smartphone market, according to findings from IHS Markit published on August 5. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year decline for the smartphone market. With 35.3 million units shipped in the second quarter of 2019, Apple fell behind prominent Chinese smartphone makers Oppo and Huawei, as well as South Korean electronics giant Samsung. That marks a decrease from the same quarter one year ago, when Apple shipped 41.3 million iPhones and placed in third. IHS Markit attributes part of Apple's decline to a lack of price elasticity in its older models, making previous devices a tougher sell, as well as premium pricing for its newer handsets.",BB,en,Business Insider

Finding a facial cleanser that cleans your skin but doesn't dry you out is a tall order. Finding one that doesn't cost a lot makes it so much harder. I have very dry skin and have found that most cleansers dry my skin out to the point where I loathe washing my face. So far, the only products that seem to clean my skin without drying it out are oil cleansers, but those can be messy and I constantly long for a hydrating cleanser I can use in the shower.

2019-05-14 08:00:00-05:00,Young Consumer Base Demands Innovative New Offerings From Telecom Providers,"NEW YORK , May 14, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- The rapid development of technology has had a profound impact on consumer trends and demands, with expectations largely growing unabated. The very first generation of wireless telephone technology was commercially available during the 1980s, while nowadays, most consumers are connected to a 4G LTE network on their mobile phones. 4G LTE technology provides download speeds upwards of 50 megabits per seconds. At the current bit rate, which currently goes up to 50 megabits per second, consumers can view a movie with little to no buffering interruptions or load a web page in a matter of seconds. Bit rates are crucial for various applications because they dictate how fast a consumer can access data. During peak internet usage, consumers can experience their upload or download speeds drastically slow down. Moreover, there are specific regions across the world that aren't covered by the 4G LTE umbrella network. The slow speeds and lack of coverage can be frustrating for many consumers and as a result, the demand for 5G technology has emerged over the past several years.",BB,en,Benzinga

Mario Queiroz, Google's general manager and vice president of product management for Pixel, said that he's not convinced there's a compelling use case for foldable devices just yet. ""I don't think that the product is quite innovative enough yet,"" he said in a recent interview with Business Insider.
