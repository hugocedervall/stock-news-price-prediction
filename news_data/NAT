With operations in the U.S. and Mexico, Aurelius is using alternative routes to augment our knowledge of cannabinoid science, making up for the lost time that the federal prohibition is weighing on research. Creating The Prescriber’s Reference For Medical Cannabis “It is medicine that should be treated like medicine,” said Julie Armstrong, CEO and Co-founder of Aurelius Data in a recent interview with Benzinga. The executive and Master in Pharmacy said that there’s a large pool of data from cannabis that nobody is looking at right now; that’s the information that comes from people who are already using cannabis as a medication.

2020-01-14 09:10:32-05:00,Why Haven't Iran Tensions Hiked Tanker Rates (Yet)?,"What makes markets so interesting — and maddening — is that they tend to behave in ways you didn't expect. Take crude-tanker shipping. In October 2019, the threat to oil exports from the Middle East pushed spot freight rates to $190,000 per day. The supply-demand balance is even tighter now, and Middle East crude flows are once again theoretically under threat, so rates and tanker stock pricing should shoot up again, right? In fact, rates have held relatively steady and stock prices are down. The U.S. killed Iranian general Qassem Suleimani on Jan. 2. Iran retailed with airstrikes on Iraqi bases housing Americans on Jan. 7. If markets followed the pattern seen in the second half of last year, oil shippers would have bid up spot rates as they sought to secure cargoes as a hedge against possible military action in and around the Strait of Hormuz. They haven't, at least not yet. According to Clarksons Platou Securities, rates for very large crude carriers (VLCCs, tankers that carry 2 million barrels of crude each) averaged $92,300 per day on Jan. 10, down 13% from the day before and down 3% week-on-week.",NAT,en,Benzinga Feeds
