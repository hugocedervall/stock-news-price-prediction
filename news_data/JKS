The “blue wave” trades -- higher stocks and yield-curve steepening -- have faded this week. Mixed bank earnings, dwindling hopes for pre-election stimulus and skittishness about the virus and vaccine left investors with fewer reasons to bid up risky assets.

That said, if President Trump does overcome his deficit in recent polls, it would be the biggest underdog victory since World War II, according to Deutsche Bank’s Jim Reid.

Sadly, President Trump has wrecked trade and political relations with Europe, Japan, India and other traditional allies. But the Chinese hegemonic threat will remain the big challenge of the 21st century. In this context, clashes In the Galwan Valley or Doklam are tiny, irrelevant skirmishes. The real battle will be fought and won at the highest technological level.China has made huge technological strides even as the USA loses steam. India has woefully under-appreciated this. India’s new mantra of Atmanirbhar (self-sufficiency) is an unfortunate throwback to Nehru’s failed self-sufficiency. Industries cowering behind protective trade walls will never beat China economically or strategically. Indian businessmen still accuse China of using cheap labour and subsidies to dump cheap exports.

2020-07-30 13:32:00-05:00,Chevron to Build 500MW of Renewables to Power Oil and Gas Facilities,"Chevron announced it will build 500 megawatts of renewable energy plants to power some of its global facilities, in what amounts to a sizeable clean-energy upscaling for an oil giant with comparatively few big investments in renewables to date. Chevron will work with Canada’s Algonquin Power & Utilities, a growing global renewables developer, to build the plants over the next four years in Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, Argentina, Kazakhstan and Western Australia. The initial projects will be sited on Chevron-owned land, with construction to begin in 2021. The renewables projects will be jointly co-developed and owned by Chevron and Algonquin, with Chevron buying the electricity through power purchase agreements. U.S. oil producers lag their European rivals in making strategic investments into clean energy companies and technologies, but as voracious consumers of electricity — and often in remote areas — they have taken a growing interest in low-cost wind and solar power.

2020-06-02 03:50:00-05:00,Threat of Renewable Policy U-Turns Deterring Corporate Investors,"Businesses worldwide are getting behind the move to cleaner energy systems. But a significant minority of investors remains wary of shifting regulations, according to research in May from Ashurst, an international law firm. The firm’s Powering Change: Energy in Transition report , based on a poll of more than 2,000 business leaders across the G20, found 88 percent of companies have pivoted their investment strategies towards low-carbon energy in the last year. Much of this was in response to tougher government stances on climate change and decarbonization, said Antony Skinner, global co-head of power and utilities for Ashurst. However, 31 percent of respondents said lack of government support was a significant barrier to low-carbon investment. In many cases, Skinner said, this support was related to having stable regulatory frameworks. “Consistency and certainty, for any investment, is a really important element,” said Skinner. This appears to be more important even than maintaining subsidy schemes in the long term, since many investors will be willing to bet on the gradual removal of subsidies provided it happens in a predictable way.",JKS,en,Green Technology (Feed)

2019-05-09 08:00:00-05:00,Inventive Renewable Energy Storage Systems Reveal New Possibilities,"NEW YORK , May 9, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Climate change is a major concern on every countries' agenda. With the rise of the massive industries and the proliferation of vehicles, non-renewable resources such as oil and fossil fuels are rapidly depleting. Consequently, the constant use of these resources is causing adverse effects on the globe. Climate change generally occurs as a byproduct of natural forces such as the Sun, volcanoes, or even the Earth's orbit. However, the use of non-renewable powered applications is negatively accelerating climate change. The Committee on Climate Change reported that CO2 emissions have increased by over 400% since 1950. The alarming rates have thus prompted many companies to transition towards manufacturing cleaner energy sources. In particular, energy storage solutions have become a major topic of discussion in recent times. Energy storage systems consist of equipment that can conveniently store multiple forms of energy which can be utilized at any time.",JKS,en,Benzinga
