2020-09-22 09:49:26-05:00,Wondering whether to go long on growth or value stocks? JP Morgan's take on EPS estimates could help answer the question.,"Summary List Placement Growth stocks have once again outperformed value stocks over the past two weeks, said JP Morgan's equity analyst, Mislav Matejka, in a note on Monday. He expects this trend to continue. This year, there was a widespread view that non-fundamental factors were key in driving stock selection, Matejka said. But JP Morgan has found that, generally, stocks with more robust earnings delivery have had a much higher chance of outperforming. ""In the majority of sectors, 70%-100% of stock outperformers displayed better relative [earnings per share] momentum than their sector and the market, and vice versa,"" Matejka said. But JP Morgan is predicting that momentum in earnings per share is about to change due to a slowdown in economic activity. The general consensus among analysts is that value and cyclical sector stocks are expected to grow at a much faster pace than the rest of the market, producing double-digit earnings growth in 2021, Matejka said. But when combining the higher earnings hurdle rates for these sectors compared to the rest of the market and the likely slowdown in activity, these sectors could see EPS revisions that rarely remain in positive territory, Matejka said. ""We see significant risk of disappointment [in cyclicals and value sectors],"" Matejka said.",ASC,en,Business Insider

From in-store layaway to store-branded credit cards, retailers have always used financing as a way to convert browsers to buyers. But over the last several years, a cohort of fintechs have cropped up offering a new way for retailers to boost sales: buy now, pay later. From no-interest, two-week installment plans to longer-term financing, fintechs like Affirm, Afterpay, and Klarna, to name a few, have won over millions of consumers and tens of thousands of retailers with their digital-forward, easy-to-use alternatives to credit cards. It's no secret that e-commerce is on the rise with continued growth year-over-year for the last decade. And like other digitally-driven trends, the coronavirus pandemic has only accelerated growth in the e-commerce segment. In 2019, e-commerce accounted for 11% of total retail sales in the US. In 2020, total retail sales have been down, but in the second quarter this year, with brick-and-mortar retail largely shut down, e-commerce grew to 16% of total retail sales, reflecting a 44% increase quarter-over-quarter, according to the US Census Bureau .",ASC,en,Business Insider

Business Insider has compiled a list of the richest people in the fashion industry, based on Forbes' Real Time Billionaires ranking and Bloomberg Billionaires Index — and the top 15 are worth a combined $410.8 billion. The wealthiest person in fashion is Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH , the world's largest maker of luxury goods that's behind brands such as Louis Vuitton, Dom Perignon, Christian Dior, and as of November 2019, Tiffany & Co. Others on the list include Giorgio Armani, the founder of Nike, the Japanese billionaire behind Uniqlo, and the Spanish retail mogul who owns Zara.

Child labor , p overty wages , and a lack of transparency means that garment workers — especially in the global South — are consistently exploited. The same goes with environmental concerns: the fashion industry is responsible for 10% of humanity's carbon emissions, 35% of all microplastics in the ocean, and 85% of all textiles produced annually end up in landfill . With stats like those, it's clear that the fashion industry's reckoning has been a long time coming. COVID-19 is that reckoning. Fashionably late In April, The Guardian reported that major high street fashion brands, including Primark and Matalan, had cancelled or suspended orders for £2.4 billion worth of garments from factories in Bangladesh. Over 97% of suppliers surveyed by the WRC and Penn State University said that brands had offered ""no financial assistance"" to cover furlough or severance costs; the executive director of the WRC described the situation as a ""wholesale abandoning of workers and suppliers"" by brands.",ASC,en,Business Insider

The value investing strategy, which seeks to invest in companies that are undervalued by the market, has fallen firmly out of fashion in recent years as big tech ‘growth’ stocks like Facebook, Apple, and Amazon have taken over the large-cap equities indexes. Over the past 25 years, growth funds have outperformed value funds, returning an average of 1,072 per cent, versus a more meagre 624 per cent for value funds, according to research from CAMRADATA. Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management, says that value investing pays off in periods of economic instability.

2019-09-06 10:51:00-05:00,The best places to buy ear cuffs,"Ear cuffs are a great way to accessorize and get a pierced look without an actual piercing. Brands and retailers like Mejuri , Etsy , ASOS , Nordstrom , and The Last Line have tons of ear cuffs at various prices, so it's not hard to find something that fits your style and budget. I don't have pierced ears, but I love the look. For as long as I can remember, I've solved this dilemma by wearing ear cuffs. You know, those fake earrings that typically sit along the cartilage and make people think you're a lot cooler and more hardcore than you actually are. My first ear cuff came from Claire's in the late '90s and was one of the now-ubiquitous climbing styles that will never go out of style (seriously, I just got a new one this year). As ear cuffs have become more popular, styles have also become more varied and prices run the gamut from $5 to more than $600. When shopping for ear cuffs, pay attention to the materials; real metals will be pricier than the fake stuff, but they'll last longer and are often more flexible.",ASC,en,Business Insider
