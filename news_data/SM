The good news is that one hedge fund manager is finally taking an outsized bet on oil and is making headlines. The bad news is that the ""hedge fund manager"" isn't exactly Sam Zell or Steve Cohen, but rather a former professional hockey player. Regardless, Xavier Majic, who founded Maple Rock Capital in Toronto - and who manages $700 million - says that he thinks oil is becoming a better bet as the pandemic ends. His firm recently upped its exposure to energy to 38%, which marks the highest it has been since the fund's inception. He told Bloomberg : “Covid has done things to oil demand that were unimaginable to a commodity investor. It’s inevitable that oil prices have to go much higher.” The fund's exposure to energy stood at about 4% at the end of March. Heading into Q3, his fund has 15 positions in energy, ranging between a 0.2% and 4.3% weighting.",SM,en,Zero Hedge

Addressing this, Goldman sent an email early on Monday in which the bank made the following points for those looking at energy debt: Credit markets were having problems before the Saudi announcement, credit down when equities traded higher Significant increase in non-credit accounts looking to short the sector last week Last week saw record outflow across IG, high yield and loans Liquidity issue even more prevalent because of virus related contingency / BCP planning The bank concludes by noting that "" although clients are better positioned than in 2015 (when had a lot of energy issuance to fund shale revolutions); expect continued selling as oil re-prices lower and the virus spreads.""

Investor sentiment toward risk assets in the region has improved ahead of a slew of central bank policy meetings scheduled for the week. Philippine stocks bounced back from earlier losses to close 1 percent higher, with gains concentrated in industrials.",SM,en,Reuters UK
