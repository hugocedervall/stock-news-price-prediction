But while the move will be welcomed by companies in dire need of short-term funding, it is nowhere near enough to unfreeze the broader commercial paper market, with the spread still precipitously high even for those companies that have access to commercial paper, which is why most companies continue drawing down on revolvers. As we reported over the weekend , according to JPMorgan calculations, aggregate corporate revolver drawdowns represent 77% of the total facilities, with JPM noting that the total amount of borrowing by companies is likely significantly greater than this, well above 80%, as it only reflects disclosed amounts by large companies, and there are likely undisclosed borrowings by middle market companies.",EPR,en,Zero Hedge

One such company is EP Energy, an El Paso Corp spinoff which filed for bankruptcy in 2019 as a result of the shale sector’s renewed slump (and this was when oil was still above $50). So with its its fate already in limbo after a busted rescue deal , and potential liquidation looming as a result of oil prices that just insultingly low, the company added a new possibility of what could go wrong next: the company's bankers may follow it down the bankruptcy abyss. In its latest annual report filed late on Wednesday, Bloomberg uncovered that among EP’s list of risk factors the company also included the future of its debtor-in-possession loan which is EP’s primary source of cash, and - in an a delightful case of suicidal snark, the company wondered if that might be cut off, along with funds that would enable it to exit bankruptcy, if its banks were themselves to fail.

In some cases where companies were already weakened before the coronavirus tanked the economy — particularly in the energy and retail industries — attorneys are seeing restructuring work accelerate. In cases where businesses were solely impacted by the coronavirus — like airlines, cruise ships, and restaurants — attorneys said lenders and landlords had become more lenient in light of the crisis and they didn't expect large bankruptcy filings in the immediate future. Those insights were among a handful provided to Business Insider from interviews with 15 restructuring attorneys at law firms including Jones Day, Paul Weiss, Willkie Farr, and Davis Polk.
