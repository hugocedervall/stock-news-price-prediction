Trump made the comments following two devastating mass shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio that killed at least 30 people and wounded dozens of others over the weekend. A 2015 study from researchers Dr. Jonathan Meltz and Dr. Kenneth MacLeish of Vanderbilt University, however, found that ""less than 3% to 5% of US crimes involve people with mental illness.""

Annas wrote in 2016 that ""mass shootings by people with serious mental illness represent less than 1% of all yearly gun-related homicides"" Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. President Donald Trump said Monday he believed that people with mental illness should be ""involuntarily confined"" in order to prevent mass shootings, despite research showing that people with mental illness are responsible for a tiny percentage of gun violence.

2019-03-14 01:05:22-05:00,Spring Culture Preview 2019: Colossal Art from Qatar to Hudson Yards,"(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- A year and a half after the Louvre Abu Dhabi opened, the Gulf is getting another Jean Nouvel landmark—the National Museum of Qatar. Spread across more than 36 acres, the museum, which officially opens in Doha on March 28, contains 560,000 square feet of galleries, conservation space, theaters, educational facilities, and restaurants. “As you walk through the different volumes, you never know what’s coming next,” Nouvel said in a statement. “The idea was to create contrasts, spring surprises.” One of those surprises will be the museum’s collection, which until now has been a tightly guarded secret. The Al-Thanis, the country’s ruling family, are some of the most prolific collectors in the world. Various branches of the clan own, among other works, The Card Players by Paul Cézanne, the 30-carat Shah Jahan Emerald, and a $142 million triptych by Francis Bacon. But more than 80 percent of the 94,000 square feet of gallery space will be devoted to the museum’s permanent collection, which focuses on “the environmental, cultural, and political ­history of Qatar.” In total, there are 11 interlinked galleries on a ­1.5-­kilometer-long “visitors circuit,” a tour through the museum that’s supposed to take about two hours.",KNL,en,Bloomberg
