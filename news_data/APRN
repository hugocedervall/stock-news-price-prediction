2019-02-21 21:30:33-05:00,Why Startups Are Low-Balling Valuations When Assigning Employee Stock Options,"Start up companies become ""conveniently"" pessimistic about their valuations prior to going public when stock options are handed out to employees, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis . The lower valuations create a windfall for employees and can lower their tax burdens going forward. The report analyzed recent initial public offerings and identified 68 companies that gave employees stock options to buy about $1.5 billion worth of stock during the 12 month run up to each respective company's IPO. The fair market value of those shares, however, was an estimated $2.2 billion at the time, based on a valuation model developed by academics. This is the equivalent of a 32% discount on shares for employees. Will Gornall, an assistant finance professor at the University of British Columbia, said: “The Journal’s findings show that the valuations being reported by companies are significantly below what the shares are really worth —the price that investors would pay for them.” This year, these types of valuations will be in focus as names like Uber and Pinterest prepare to go public.",APRN,en,Zero Hedge
