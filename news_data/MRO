2020-12-08 08:05:00-05:00,Goldman Sachs highlights the top 25 dividend issuers on the S&P 500 to buy as it expects their payouts to rebound next year and keep growing over the next decade,"Summary List Placement As many Wall Street strategists have called it, November was truly a month to remember. Thanks to positive vaccine news, the S&P 500 rose nearly 11% to deliver some of its best gains in the past 30 years while out-of-favor value stocks staged a massive comeback from their underperformance in the last decade or more. Since Pfizer's early November announcement that its vaccine had a 90%+ efficacy rate , Goldman Sachs' long/short value factor, which underperformed for most of the last four years, has surged 12% as of December 3, according to a Monday client note. For investors who have missed the value train, there are still other opportunities that have lagged the market but are well-positioned for the post-pandemic economy. Aside from cyclically oriented value stocks, S&P 500 dividend futures remain an attractive opportunity that trades at significant discounts, Chief US Equity Strategist David Kostin said in the note. While realized S&P 500 dividends per share fell by 5.6% year-over-year in the third quarter, many companies such as Darden Restaurants (DRI), Marathon Oil (MRO), and Estee Lauder (EL) that had suspended dividend payments earlier in the year due to COVID-19 impacts have now resumed, Kostin explained.",MRO,en,Business Insider

Barring an unforeseen rally, 2020 will go down as the worst year for crude oil since 2014, and a recent analysis from the International Monetary Fund doesn’t anticipate prices breaking this range over the next 12 months. This bearish sentiment—the result of a supply gut, reduced global demand, and long-term shifts towards renewable energy—has benefitted the performance of two of Direxion’s inverse energy funds, the Direxion Daily S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Bear 2x Shares (NYSE: DRIP ), which is up about 30% since the start of August, and the Direxion Daily Energy Bear 2X Shares (NYSE: ERY ) , both Leveraged ETFs, which is higher by 40% in that same span.

We’re talking about a quarter where the price of U.S. crude oil averaged $28 a barrel, the lowest for any three-month period in nearly two decades. In one strange confluence of events, crude oil even traded negative for a brief period. This is something never seen before. Crude rebounded to back near $40 a barrel by the end of Q2 and remains right around there as of mid-July, still not enough to rescue the sector from what are likely to be horrific earnings results. As of last week, research firm FactSet pegged the average Q2 earnings per share loss for S&P 500 Energy firms at 149.9% vs. a year ago. Keep in mind that Energy wasn’t exactly tearing up the pea patch even in 2019, before COVID-19 came along.

That goes across all sub-sectors of Energy, though losses are projected to be worse for some parts than others.",MRO,en,Benzinga Feeds
