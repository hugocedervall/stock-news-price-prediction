Oktober 2020 nur im Kino! Kate Taylor ist eine scheinbar perfekte britische Offiziersgattin. Die Ungewissheit, die sie während des Auslandseinsatzes ihres Mannes empfindet, überspielt sie in der Öffentlichkeit mit einem strahlenden Lächeln. Eine Freizeitgruppe soll sie und die anderen Ehefrauen der Militärbasis auf andere Gedanken bringen, doch Teetrinken und Stricken sind so gar nicht nach Kates Geschmack. Warum nicht lieber einen Chor gründen? Die rebellische Lisa, bisher tonangebend in der Gruppe, kann mit Kates Art und den amateurhaften Gesangsversuchen nicht viel anfangen. Mit der Zeit lässt sich aber auch Lisa von der Lebensfreude der Frauen anstecken – und so rauft sich das ungleiche Frauenduo zusammen und leitet den Chor gemeinsam.",SCL,de,KURIER Medienhaus

Die Nachfrage brach im Frühling dermaßen schlagartig ein, dass die Unternehmen nicht mehr wussten, wo sie den sonst so gefragten Rohstoff lagern sollten. Die Preise verfielen und erreichten im April sogar kurz einen negativen Wert. Das heißt, der Verkäufer schenkt dem Käufer das Öl und legt sogar noch etwas drauf. Entsprechend setzte es im ersten Halbjahr deutliche Verluste für die Branche. Die Organisation erdölexportierender Länder und ihre Verbündeten (OPEC+) reagierten mit einer Reduktion der Fördermenge um etwa 10 Prozent. Über den Sommer pendelte sich der Preis für ein Barrel (159 Liter) der Nordseesorte Brent bei etwa 40 US-Dollar ein. Im Jahresvergleich ist er noch immer um mehr als 20 Prozent niedriger.

The innovation is a new solid oxide electrochemical reactor design that Utility Global, a spinout from Utah research hub Hall Labs, says can be used to deliver blue hydrogen 30 percent cheaper and with 30 percent less carbon emissions than traditional steam methane reforming. Blue hydrogen is made from natural gas in the process of steam methane reformation, with the resulting emissions curtailed through carbon capture and storage. Blue hydrogen is one of several methods aiming to cut the carbon emissions associated with industrial production of the gas. It is purportedly cleaner than the current industrial processes but still a long way from being zero-emission or ‘green’ hydrogen, which is made using renewable power and electrolyzers.
