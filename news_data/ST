The bank's chief US equity strategist and chief investment officer said in a Monday note that he expects the market to drop another 10% in the near term as investors face uncertainty around the election outcome, more fiscal stimulus, and another wave of COVID-19. But once the dust settles, Wilson said he expects the bull market to ensue — one which will be led by cyclical and smaller-cap stocks as earnings get a boost from the economic recovery. As such, Wilson recommended using a near term sell-off as a buying opportunity. ""We think the best opportunities lie in stocks where earnings are growing with the cyclical rebound and growing by enough to offset any valuation headwinds,"" Wilson said. He continued: ""On any pullbacks, we would look to our earnings upside screen from September — 66% of stocks have outperformed the market with median outperformance of 2.","ST,SSB",en,Business Insider

The Federal Court ruled that the tie-up between Vodafone’s local joint venture partner, Hutchison Telecommunications (Australia) Ltd, and TPG would not harm competition. That trumped last year’s negative decision by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and revives a plan to challenge the dominance of Telstra Corp Ltd and Singapore Telecommunications’s Optus in the Australian market. “The proposed merger would not have the effect, nor be likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition in the supply of retail mobile services in Australia,“ Federal Court judge John Middleton said on Thursday. “Accordingly … the merger can proceed as contemplated,“ he added.

Subhash Chandra is also in talks to sell a substantial stake in Zee Entertainment. The Essel Group’s total debt stands at Rs 17,174 crore, which includes debt of private unlisted companies as well as the listed ones. 68824007 “The negotiations (for Dish TV) are around the valuations, with an expected offer at over Rs 50 a share for the promoter stake,” said one of the people mentioned earlier. “Due diligence is on, and the deal is expected to be completed in two months.”At Rs 50 a share for the 87% stake, including the open offer, the effective payout for the consortium could be roughly $1.15 billion (nearly Rs 8,000 crore).CONSORTIUM WILL HAVE TO TAKE ON DISH TV’S DEBTIn addition, the Singtel-Bharti Airtel-Warburg Pincus consortium would need to take on Dish TV’s debt, which stood at Rs 3,154 crore (around $451 million) as on March 31, 2018.",ST,en,The Economic Times India
