2019-04-18 04:00:20-05:00,Bloodsport on Wall Street: Hedge Funds Make Mayhem for Profit,"(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- Conventional investing isn’t a zero-sum game: One investor can buy shares of Apple Inc., and another can buy Microsoft Inc., and both can make money. Even if the two companies brutally compete with each other for market share, both can grow as long the technology business does. That’s not true with the financial instruments known as credit-default swaps. In this arena, one investor comes out the winner, and the other will be the loser. These derivatives are a way to wager on whether a company will default on its debt. They work like insurance for lenders—except you don’t have to own the company’s debt to buy protection against failure. The trader on one side of the bet collects the insurance payments as long as things go well; the one on the other side can get a big payday if they don’t. Someone’s going to get hurt. “The participants in this CDS market are all incredibly sophisticated, with wonderful lawyers” Some hedge funds that invest in credit-default swaps have turned this market into the financial equivalent of Fight Club, weaponizing the fine print in esoteric contracts.",HOV,en,Bloomberg
