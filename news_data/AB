2020-12-07 17:24:18.000,Core Goldman Sachs Won't Flee New York for Florida,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. traces its roots back more than 150 years to 1869, when Marcus Goldman, a German immigrant, moved to New York City and opened a one-room office in a basement next to a coal chute at 30 Pine Street. Today, that address represents the heart of Manhattan’s financial district: One block north of Wall Street and one block south of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Goldman Sachs Asset Management, by contrast, was formed in 1988.This difference is important context to keep in mind after reading the scoop from Bloomberg News’s Sridhar Natarajan that Goldman is considering a new Florida hub to house its asset-management division. The news naturally set off alarms about the end of New York City as the undisputed financial capital of the U.S., given the surprise decision by AllianceBernstein Holding LP in 2018 to move its headquarters to Nashville and, more recently, the increased presence of Blackstone Group Inc. and Citadel in the Sunshine State.Make no mistake: Goldman is a powerhouse in asset management, managing $1.46 trillion as of the end of the third quarter, up 19% from a year earlier and more than Morgan Stanley’s investment management division stands to oversee even after the bank acquires Eaton Vance Corp.","AB,BX",en,Yahoo Finance
2020-12-02 13:14:13.000,Bitcoin Institutional Adoption Is Flashing Green; Money Is Flowing from Gold into BTC,"As Bitcoin continues to rally hard to its new all-time highs, more and more people and institutions have come out in support of the largest cryptocurrency. “Bitcoin’s moment has arrived,” said Guy Hirsch of eToro US, according to whom institutional involvement is one of the reasons for the recent advance. It also needs to be pointed out that now the market has numerous ways for institutional investors to get exposure to crypto, which didn’t exist in 2017. Most recently, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink talked about how Bitcoin can evolve into a global market. The research arm of AllianceBernstein, Bernstein Research, also had a change of heart. According to Inigo Fraser-Jenkins, BTC has a role in asset allocation thanks to a “significant reduction” in its volatility, making it attractive as a store of value and medium of exchange. He even likened it to gold. “It's starting to turn into a stampede for Bitcoin. Bernstein suggests a 1.5-10% allocation for BTC. Huge.

Companies like Regeneron, Eli Lilly, and AstraZeneca are using the body's own disease-fighting proteins, called antibodies, as the source material to develop coronavirus drugs. The leading efforts are now applying for emergency approval, with one even being used experimentally as part of President Donald Trump's COVID-19 treatment regimen. Six programs have started human testing, led by Lilly, Regeneron, Vir Biotechnology, AstraZeneca, Celltrion, and SAB Biotherapeutics. Lilly, Regeneron, Vir, and AstraZeneca are in the final stage of clinical testing. Lilly and Regeneron have both applied for emergency authorization for their drugs from the US Food and Drug Administration.

Like most viruses, the novel coronavirus isn't likely to disappear from the population for good. Instead, the world's best hope is a combination of public-health measures, drug treatments, and a vaccine. Under the most optimistic scenario, the US could be ready to manufacture a vaccine by the end of 2020. But by then, the virus is expected to kill an additional 23,000 people on top of the current death tol of 172,000, according to models from the University of Washington.

The Turkish lira has cratered against the dollar and most developed currencies, plunging from 3 TRY per dollar, to a record low 7.37 last week after a brief and valiant attempt at imposing shadow capital control by Erdogan (who is now de facto head of the Turkish central bank ) failed miserably at the end of July , and not even a draconian hike in overnight funding rates above 1000% last week (to crush the shorts) was able to prevent a plunge in the Lira to new all time lows . As their currency implodes (in a nation that is becoming increasingly more ""banana"" with each passing day as Erdogan solidifies his takeover of every government institution, in the process turning off any potential foreign investors) Turks are discouraged from material purchases of dollars to hedge the collapse in their native currency due to some of the strictest capital controls on the planet, which has left them with just one option.",AB,en,Zero Hedge

In sectors, earnings were hit hard in energy, capital goods, autos, travel, financials, and healthcare providers. On the other side, earnings held in relatively well in staples, utilities, and real estate. Looking ahead, BofA expects earnings to contract 30% on the Y/Y scale in Q2, before beginning to recover gradually from there. That's about as far as any forecasts will go, as visibility for earnings growth a year from now is virtually nonexistent, however for some bizarre reason, bottom-up consensus numbers are showing a +15% growth for Q1 2021 Y/Y, and it's unclear where this growth will come from. Like this website, BofA says that it ""would take the other side of that view and assume a -15% drop in earnings in our models and base-case scenarios.""

But economists say the upswing probably won't last.,"The pace of economic growth flew past expectations in the first quarter. But the broad reading may have masked pockets of weakness in the economy. Perhaps most concerning for economists, a less volatile measure of private-sector activity came in surprisingly weak in the first quarter. Gross domestic product, a measure of all the goods and services produced in the country, grew at a far faster pace than expected in the first quarter. But the broad reading may have masked pockets of weakness in the economy.

The factors that lifted GDP 3.2% from a year earlier aren't expected to last. Economists said a sharp jump in exports, for example, was largely due to companies rushing orders ahead of scheduled escalations in the ongoing trade war between Washington and Beijing. ""Put an asterisk next to it as the first quarter expansion was driven by unsustainable inventory accumulation, a temporary narrowing of the trade deficit and a one-time increase in government sponsored construction,"" said Joe Brusuelas, the chief economist at RSM, a financial-consulting company.",AB,en,Business Insider
