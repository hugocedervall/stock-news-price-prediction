Since November 23, the first working day after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) ordered a special audit into SREI’s books, bond prices plunged 13.5%.A particular bond series for Srei Equipment Finance, maturing in 2028, saw its price drop to Rs 666.01 (adjusted for interest) compared with Rs 770 on Monday.“In the past few months, investors have been looking to exit Srei’s bonds. This has intensified after RBI’s proposed audit for the company’s books of accounts,” said a Mumbai-based wealth manager.Wealthy investors, market sources said, are reaching out to wealth managers, with brokers offering to offload those bonds at deep discounts. Yields on offer ranged up to 25% for bonds with shorter duration residual maturities, dealers said.

The issue, which was sold from September 9 to September 11 in the price band of Rs 345-350, was subscribed 73.3 times.There are expectations that the stock will see strong investor response on market debut. The unofficial market for unlisted shares is already reflecting this sentiment, with the stock quoting a premium of Rs 194-197 per share, according to Dinesh Gupta of Unlisted Zone, an outfit that deals in unlisted shares.Assuming that an HNI has borrowed money at 7 per cent interest rate for Route IPO with 192.81 times subscription and upper band price of Rs 350, the cost of funding would be Rs 90.59 i.e. Rs 350 (issue price, say) X 192.81 (number of times subscription) X 7/100 (assuming 7 per cent rate of interest) X 7/365 (assuming money borrowed for seven days). The breakeven for HNIs taking leverage on Route Mobile IPO at 7 per cent for seven days thus comes at Rs 440 (Rs 350+Rs 90.59).",HNI,en,Economic Times India

These would act as significant resistance point in the immediate future. If markets are to continue the uptrend, they need to cross these points and then sustain the gains. This means a minimum rally of 1,700 points on BSESENSEX and 450 points on NIFTY. Markets gained on two of the five trading sessions, but the sharp losses on Monday and Friday ensured that there could be no recovery on a weekly basis. The Indian Rupee gained 24 paise or 0.33 per cent to close at Rs 73.14 to the US Dollar. Dow Jones lost 520.56 points or 1.82 per cent to close at 28,133.31 points.

There is a good headroom in auto component stocks because as you rightly said, this quarter was a complete washout, plants were shut for 45 days and there were so many logistical issues. Many auto components companies had a negative operating leverage and they reported very bad numbers. I would say that auto components should be a good investment opportunity from here on.

2020-05-29 04:45:32-05:00,Debt market’s love for G-Secs & PSU papers is here to stay,"Investors put money in debt mutual funds to get stable returns. The return on a debt portfolio is broken into two parts: the income which is the coupon/yield to maturity (YTM) of the underlying securities in the portfolio, and the price appreciation of securities in the portfolio.Analysing the total returns over a longer time frame, 80-85 per cent of returns is generated by YTM of the portfolio and the balance 15-20 per cent by capital appreciation.In the past, retail and HNI investors have always been inclined towards schemes that offered higher YTM. YTM is the stable part of the returns of the portfolio. The risk of a high-quality portfolio is volatility, as the underlying securities are traded frequently.However, we are seeing a shift of retail and HNI investors from credit funds to good quality portfolios this financial year. Lower GDP growth and high leverage of Indian companies have led to credit quality deterioration and security prices moving down/marked down in a portfolio. It is because of this that the returns of high yielding portfolios have not matched the YTM of the portfolio.Yields on government securities and ‘AAA’-rated PSU papers have come down due to RBI cutting repo and reverse repo rates by 225 basis points and 265 basis points in the last one year.",HNI,en,Economic Times India

But how confident are you that this recovery will come through and that we will see concrete signs of economic revival over the next couple of quarters?It is certainly impossible to say the exact time when the recovery will happen. But it is fair to say that the recovery will happen. As we have seen in the US markets, eventually valuations will play out and at 9,000-9,100 on Nifty, I think we are relatively valued at close to around 16.5-17-17.5 times, which is close to the lower end of the valuation range and we are also close to 2.3-2.4 times Nifty on the book value multiple. For a long-term investor, these are definitely levels you can come in at. Are these the lowest levels you can come in at? It is extremely difficult to decide that. I think markets can head lower but over the next three to five years, if you enter at these levels, there is definitely money to be made.",HNI,en,Economic Times India
