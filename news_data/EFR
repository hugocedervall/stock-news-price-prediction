As a reminder, Friday's sharp move higher took place after House and Senate lawmakers revealed a compromise version of the annual National Defense Authorization Act . According to S&P Global, the bill effectively provides for the military to continue a policy under President-elect Joe Biden that classifies the domestic supplies of certain minerals such as uranium, graphite and lithium as vital to national security. This sent most uranium companies sharply higher, with names such as Cameco rising 9.7%, Uranium Energy +10%, Energy Fuels +17%, North Short GLobal Uranium Mining +6%. On Monday, this dramatic move higher has accelerated further, with most names rising double digits if fading modestly in afternoon trading as shown below: While there was no material catalyst behind today's move besides traders digesting our note from Friday, Cameco, which controls the world’s largest high-grade uranium reserves and low-cost operations and is one of the largest global providers of the uranium fuel, reported yesterday that an individual at its Cigar Lake uranium mine in Saskatchewan has tested positive for COVID-19.",EFR,en,Zero Hedge

Even ahead of today's NDAA announcement, the URA Uranium ETF was breaking out of an elongated bear market and downtrending channel to the upside as Larry McDonald's latest Bear Traps report showed. Even ahead of today's announcement, Bear Traps noted that ""CCJ and uranium have been fading sideways since June while the rest of the commodity space has rallied"" and added that it expects uranium names ""to play catch-up in the months ahead."" Reminding readers that uranium has historically been a high-flying sector, the report predicts that ""if the mad-mob trading FCEL and other ESG names gets ahold of uranium…",EFR,en,Zero Hedge

2019-11-04 11:43:54-05:00,EDF’s Energy Storage Ambitions Come Out of Hibernation,"European utility giant EDF has acquired the British energy storage and EV infrastructure developer Pivot Power, following the French state-owned energy firm's declaration last year that it would invest $10 billlion in energy storage by 2035 . The deal gives EDF access to a 2-gigawatt pipeline of projects and to Pivot’s inventive route to market, in the absence of readily available contracted revenue for battery assets. In Europe, tenders for services such as enhanced frequency response (EFR) have been largely saturated, leaving storage developers to either look for new sources of contracted revenues or to take a chance with some merchant risk . This deal could allow EDF and Pivot to boost deployment against a backdrop of stagnant growth in the U.K. “EDF has made a lot of noise with ambitions to be a leader of the global energy storage market announced last year,"" said Rory McCarthy, senior storage analyst at Wood Mackenzie. ""However, they haven’t actioned this with anything in the U.K.",EFR,en,Green Technology
