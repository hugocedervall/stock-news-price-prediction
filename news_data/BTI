In particular, investors have taken profit on the stocks that profited from the pandemic and its work-from-home economy and put their cash into some of the most beaten-down sectors of the equity market, such as airlines, cruiselines and energy companies. And this is unlikely to be a blip. This rotation from growth stocks into value investments has 'legs', according to a note from JP Morgan Casenove, who have combed through the stocks universe in Europe - which has seen over a quarter of a million deaths from the virus - to find their top picks that could profit from this reversal. With developments on the vaccine front coming from US drugmaker Pfizer last week and Moderna on Monday, the backdrop is looking a lot more supportive on a longer-term basis compared to the relief-rally in May, JP Morgan strategists said in a note published Monday.",BTI,en,Business Insider

But equity analysts and quant strategists at the bank are expecting that to change going forward as obstacles for value outperformance begin to fade. ""European value versus growth has yet to price in the macro recovery,"" Bank of America equity analyst, Sebastian Raedler, said in the note. Raedler identifies two obstacles in the way of value outperformance. Firstly, bond yields have not risen meaningfully in response to improving economic macro data. Secondly, two of the big European value sectors have continued to underperform —energy and financials. He expects with a maturing economic recovery this will translate to rising bond yields and an improving earnings cycle for these lagging sectors. The removal of these obstacles should translate to a 10% upside for value versus growth stocks by the first quarter of next year, Raedler said. ""[Bank of America quant strategists] argue that the cyclical reasons for owning value have strengthened: (a) their Style Cycle and US & EM regional indicators point to a synchronized pick-up; (b) EPS Revision Ratio for value stocks is the strongest since 2018; and (c) 90% of Fund Managers expect a vaccine in place by H1 next year, which should help to lift bond yields,"" Raedler said.",BTI,en,Business Insider

Over the past three months, dividends have slumped by 49.1 per cent, making it the lowest third quarter total since 2010, when the UK was suffering the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis. “Though by any normal standards a fall of this magnitude is terrible for investors, it is significantly better than the 57.2 per cent drop in the second quarter,” writes Link Group. Banks accounted for almost two fifths of the GBP14.5 billion cuts in the third quarter of 2020, as they remain barred from paying dividends by the Bank of England until 2021. Meanwhile, the oil sector contributed another fifth to the cuts, which Link Group says will be “longer lasting” than the cuts made by banks.",BTI,en,InstitutionAlassetManager

2020-10-08 02:00:00-05:00,Betting against the FTSE 100 netted traders £418 million in September. These are the top 5 most and least profitable short sells last month,"Summary List Placement Short sellers made a profit of £418 million across the entire FTSE 100 index in September, according to recent analysis from Ortex Analytics , a global financial analytics company. The FTSE 100 was one of the worst-performing major indices in Europe in September, as a surge in cases of COVID-19 and tighter restrictions on movement, coupled with renewed concern over Brexit, hit UK assets harder than most regional markets. The index fell 2%, compared with a 1.6% fall in the euro zone Stoxx 50. The FTSE tracks the 100 largest companies on the London Stock Exchange with the highest market capitalization. Overall, short sellers made a profit on 53 out of the 100 companies in the index. Some of the FTSE's heavyweight stocks are those that have been worst-hit by the economic fallout of the pandemic, including jet engine manufacturer Rolls Royce, airlines, such as British Airways parent company IAG, or financial stock, such as HSBC or Barclays.

Overall, short sellers made gains from more than half of all FTSE 100-listed companies (53 out of 100), according to new data from Ortex Analytics, with Rolls Royce proving to be the most profitable wager, bringing in GBP187.7 million for bearish managers. September’s bounce-back marks a reversal of fortunes for hedge funds betting against FTSE 100 companies, an index often seen as a bellwether for investor confidence. In August, managers suffered a GBP420 million hit after UK equity market gains sent many sizable short bets southwards. Peter Hillerberg, co-founder of London-based equity research firm Ortex, noted that four of the five most profitable shorts in September had earlier been significant loss-makers in August, underlining how renewed uncertainty over the Covid-19 pandemic has underpinned the rebound. “Last month we saw a number of big trades turn sour for short-sellers which impacted overall profitability in August,” Hillerberg observed. “At the time, we predicted that the pendulum may swing back the other way in September and that’s exactly what we’ve seen as short sellers continue to profit from the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic.” Among the big bets to pay off were International Consolidated Airlines Group, owner of British Airways, Aer Lingus and Iberian.",BTI,en,Hedgeweek

Revenue for the quarter under review decreased by 22.5% to RM481 million compared to the same period last year. Operating expenses were marginally lower compared to the previous quarter. However, the improvement in operational efficiencies were not enough to offset revenue loss. The group declared a first interim dividend of 17 sen per share. Total legal industry volume declined by 11% against the same period last year, as persistently high levels of illegal cigarette sales and illicit nicotine vaping products continued to impact the legal tobacco market. BAT Malaysia managing director Jonathan Reed said the group’s financial performance was within expectations, however, due to the supply disruptions of legitimate tobacco manufacturers during the MCO period, consumers were forced to turn to cheap, black market cigarettes. “The government is losing RM 5.1 billion in tax revenue to the tobacco black market at a time when the country needs every ringgit for the Covid-19 fight and the subsequent recovery. “Now, more than ever, there must be focus given over to ensure that effective structural reforms are put in place to tackle this problem once and for all.",BTI,en,The Sun Daily

At the close, the benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI) was 0.73% or 10.82 points higher at 1,500.88, just a whisker above the 1,500 psychological support level, compared with yesterday’s close of 1,490.06.

The lab, part of the tobacco company’s sprawling research and development centre, is a rare indoor space where smoking is legal. Marianna Gaca, a BAT biologist, shows me a robot.

With the revocation, the product is required to comply with the restrictions applicable to cigarettes under the Control of Tobacco Product Regulations 2004. BAT managing director Erik Stoel said the unexpected “u-turn” decision made by MoH without prior notice highlighted the challenging and unreasonable parameters imposed on a legal tobacco company to operate in this country. “This product was approved as a non-cigarette not only by MoH for sale a year ago but also by the Royal Malaysian Customs.
