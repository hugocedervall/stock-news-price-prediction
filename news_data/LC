The high volume of US customers who have opted into payment deferrals since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic has complicated credit assessments, leading banks to tighten their lending standards, The Wall Street Journal reports . US consumers deferred debt payments on over 100 million accounts between March and May due to fallout from the pandemic — but that's not reflected in their credit scores. The federal government's coronavirus stimulus package indicated that banks that allow borrowers to defer their debt payments are prohibited from reporting those payments as late to credit agencies. Consequently, the millions of US consumers who have deferred payments because they are out of work or otherwise in debt have not had deferrals reflected in their credit scores, making it harder for banks to assess a complete financial picture of prospective borrowers.",LC,en,Business Insider

Historically, the US banking industry has discussed financial inclusion solely in terms of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Offering services to the underserved — unbanked consumers who lack access to banking products, and underbanked consumers who make only limited use of mainstream financial services — has long been economically unviable. But two forces have flipped the conversation from CSR to a genuine business opportunity. First, digital tools from mobile banking to AI are driving down costs and allowing financial institutions (FIs) to offer previously untenable products, such as fee-free accounts or credit scoring based on unconventional data.

2019-12-21 08:27:06-05:00,Growing pains in the alt-data world; top tech bankers weigh in on 2020 IPOs,"Hello, readers! This week, we dove into something of an existential question for the alternative-data industry: what happens when alt-data goes mainstream ? The market for selling what was once relatively unorthodox information like satellite images and credit card data to customers like hedge funds looking to gain an investing edge has exploded . (Deloitte projects it will top $7 billion in 2020.) New entrants have been rushing in, and old-school data giants like Bloomberg have launched their own alt-data platforms. M Science was a pioneer in selling non-traditional data sets to financial firms. But as Bradley Saacks and Dan DeFrancesco reported, it cut several people from its 20-person data-science team this week. And black-box data, once an easy, off-the-shelf way for customers to get in on the craze, is becoming a tougher sell for quant funds who have beefed up their own data-digesting capabilities. This is definitely a space we'll be keeping an eye on. We reported earlier this year that alt-data company Thasos struggled to make money selling to its main financial services to clients and was forced to fire two-thirds of its staff in August.",LC,en,Business Insider

To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here . US-based online personal money management startup Social Finance (SoFi) is in the final stages of securing $500 million from the Qatar Investment Authority, according to Bloomberg citing four people familiar with the matter. The funding would value SoFi at $4.3 billion — similar to its valuation after the $500 million raise led by Silver Lake in 2017 . But in order to get the same valuation, investors were asking for more protections should the company raise money or sell itself for a lower price tag in the future; however, the terms of the raise may still change.
