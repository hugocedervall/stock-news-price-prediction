And after months of digital sales growth for retailers, the shopping trend is not stopping this holiday season. Still, industry experts and analysts say that the off-price sector is in a good position to beat out department stores during this festive period, despite clear digital and e-commerce advantages for chains like Macy's or JCPenney. Department stores have historically relied on the holidays for a sizeable portion of their revenue. But stores like Marshalls, Ross, TJ Maxx, and Burlington offer deep discounts — important to cost-conscious consumers this year — as well as constantly changing merchandise, and a store environment that is generally deemed safer for shoppers as it is normally found away from malls.

Neiman Marcus - aka ""Needless Markups"" - and Lord & Taylor have filed for bankruptcy, with the later - the oldest department store in the US - in the process of liquidation.

After the bed-in-a-box company's underwhelming IPO in February, it set out on a slow, conservative path towards profitability. A major part of that plan has involved a much more traditional retail approach, one that the direct-to-consumer brand initially sought to disrupt: selling Casper products at other retailers' stores. In August, Casper inked deals to sell its products at Walmart, Sam's Club, and Ashley Furniture stores, on top of deals the company already had with Target, Costco, and other big box retailers. On Tuesday, Casper announced that its products would also be available starting this month at Macy's. The department store is a surprising retail partner for Casper, as it has struggled in recent years well before the pandemic, and has endured mass corporate layoffs and 125 store closures this year. Still, Casper CEO Philip Krim believes expanding the company's retail presence is the best way forward for the company. ""Having multiple touchpoints for consumers, so they can shop and learn and consume our product however they would like — offline, online, or a combination of both — is important,"" said Philip Krim, the CEO and co-founder of Casper, in an interview with Business Insider.",M,en,Business Insider

DSW, which has changed its name to Designer Brands with a new ticker, ""DBI,"" that will go into effect April 2, announced during its Tuesday investor day that it will focus on exclusive merchandise. ""This increase in private label goods made by Camuto will over time replace the 700 labels (20% of the mix today) that do not warrant shelf space,"" Canaccord wrote. ""While we see the potential behind this strategy, we also see risks DSW may not be accounting for, namely risk to Camuto's private label wholesale business with Dillard's and Macy's."" Canaccord analysts are concerned that Dillard's Inc. and Macy's Inc. would move their business elsewhere to reduce competition. ""[T]hat is just what we are seeing evidence of with Steve Madden having won a portion of the Dillard's private-label business,"" Canaccord said.
