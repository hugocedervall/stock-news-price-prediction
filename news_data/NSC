Hunter Harrison, a much smaller terminal railroad company in the eastern United States was demonstrating aggressive cost reduction. It was Consolidated Railroad Corporation (Conrail). What Was Conrail? Actually, there were two companies named Conrail. The first was created by the U.S. Congress (the January 1974 3-R Act) as part of the federal effort to restructure the re-organizable assets of failed railroads like Penn Central. That larger network version of Conrail went into operation service on April 1, 1976. Among its cost reduction achievements were these. Original Conrail PSR-like Improvements, 1977 – 1999: Reduced work force (from about 94,000 in 1977 to about 20,000) Reduced major railroad yards from more than 250 to fewer than 50 Reduced track miles by about half (from 40,700 miles to 20,940 miles) Reduced locomotive fleet by more than 57% Eliminated a $350 million operating loss Reported positive operating income of $500 million by 1985 Improved enterprise efficiency (operating ration) from 109+ to a relatively efficient 79.9 for the 1990s era All of this was accomplished as the company resized its asset base to better serve a market demand that went down from more than 400 million annual tons of freight traffic to less than 200 million tons between about 1976 and 1981.",NSC,en,Benzinga Feeds
