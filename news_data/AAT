2020-11-07 19:07:28,"Last Week's Notable Insider Buys: Cboe, IBM, Xerox And More","Insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors when markets face uncertainty. Activist investor Carl Icahn added to a stake last week. Financial companies and an options exchange operator saw insiders buying too. Conventional wisdom says that insiders and 10% shareholders really only buy shares of a company for one reason -- they believe the stock price will rise and they want to profit from it. So insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors, particularly when markets are near all-time highs. Though buy windows remain closed for many insiders during earnings-reporting season, plenty of others have continued to add shares despite market volatility and economic uncertainty. Here are some of the most noteworthy insider purchases reported in the past week. Carl Icahn, a 10% shareholder of Xerox Holdings Corp. (NYSE: XRX ), indirectly added about 1.06 million shares to his stake at prices ranging from $18.26 to $18.93 apiece. That cost him more than $19.45 million and raised the stake to over 28.52 million shares.",AAT,en,Benzinga
