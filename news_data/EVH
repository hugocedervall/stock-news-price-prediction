2020-08-11 11:09:38-05:00,Healthcare leaders are getting serious about what a Biden victory would mean for their businesses. 4 top execs share how a Democratic presidency would boost the industry.,"Healthcare CEOs are giving investors a peek into what would happen to their businesses if Joe Biden were to become president. Biden has promised to extend the role of government insurance, but publicly financed plans often contract with private insurers. Depending on how people wind up getting coverage, healthcare companies have the opportunity to make more money under a Biden victory. At the same time, some healthcare CEOs are concerned a Biden win might mean a higher corporate tax rate. For more stories like this, sign up here for our healthcare newsletter Dispensed. Government programs like Medicare and Medicaid have been lucrative for private health insurers. They frequently contract with government to administer coverage. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, private insurance extends to about a third of people on Medicare, which mostly covers seniors, and about 70% of people on Medicaid, a program that covers low-income people. An extension of government-funded health insurance could bode well for insurers should former vice president Joe Biden win the 2020 presidential election.",EVH,en,Business Insider

However, Calvasina says that overall market turmoil after the election would be relatively short-lived, and there could be strong tailwinds for some sectors.
