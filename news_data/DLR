As a reminder, while the Fed pre-announced its intention to purchase up to $750BN in corporate bond (including certain fallen-angel junk bonds) in March, it started purchasing bonds in May, and bond ETFs in June (among which such mainstays as LQD and HYG). By directly entering the corporate bond market - something none of his predecessors dared to do even at the depths of the financial crisis - Powell created what many believe, as GLJ's Gordon Johnson writes, ""the biggest corporate bond bubble, and junk bond bubble, in history (and that all happened before the Fed even started buying).""

According to the European Space Agency, the ozone layer over the North Pole has been depleted plenty of times in the past. Scientists using data from the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite have noticed a strong reduction of ozone concentrations over the Arctic. Unusual atmospheric conditions, including freezing temperatures in the stratosphere, have led ozone levels to plummet -- causing a ‘mini-hole' in the ozone layer, the ESA said in a statement. While the ESA scientists expect it to close up later this month, it's a troubling update on the planet's environmental health.

Hedge fund manager Ken Griffin – who started trading at age 19, and now at 51 has amassed a fortune worth $15 billion – spoke about some of the near- and long-term risks in a recent interview. Griffin sees inflation as a danger in the longer term, mostly because the financial experts lack tools to determine when inflationary trends are starting. Griffin recounts how his firm’s best analysts were caught flat-footed in 2018 when the Fed started raising rates. Regarding the lack of accurate predictive foresight, Griffin says, “If there were inflation, the markets are utterly and completely unprepared for that.” But inflation, being invisible for now, is a long-term worry. Griffin sees the coronavirus outbreak has a larger threat, at least for the present. Griffin notes that a number of major companies – Apple is a particularly good example – have already announced lower Q4 and Q1 earnings, disrupted supply chains, and even store closings in response to the viral epidemic as it expands out of China.",DLR,en,Nasdaq

2019-11-11 15:08:58-05:00,Why Smaller Might Be Better for Concentrated Solar Power,"Despite its huge potential, concentrated solar power remains one of the most expensive mainstream options for generating renewable power. Rather than looking to catch up through technological breakthroughs, the CSP industry should turn to lower-hanging fruit. That's the view of Dr. Luis Crespo, president of Protermosolar, Spain's solar thermal electricity association. Spain was a pioneer market for CSP, though it has since stalled. CSP plants with thermal storage have greater operational and capacity value than standalone PV projects, but it's ""fruitless to wait [for] electrical markets to pay more for that,” Crespo told GTM. In the meantime, the cost gap between solar thermal towers with storage and PV or wind projects has become yawning. Two relatively simple shifts in focus could help CSP grow its tiny share of the global renewables market, Crespo said, discussing the results of two recent research papers. First, CSP developers should shift their focus from daytime power delivery toward nighttime and reserve power from on-site storage, building on successful recent examples.",DLR,en,Green Technology

2019-11-05 13:16:29-05:00,5 REITs That Make the Cloud Pay You Dividends,"Most investors know about tech stocks that have harnessed the cloud for growth, such as Salesforce.com (CRM), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Amazon.com (AMZN). But are you familiar with the cloud's landlords? ""Cloud czars"" don't operate entirely on their own. There's a huge industry in connecting these clouds to each other, and to large and small customers alike. It requires cell towers, data centers and other communications technology. A number of real estate investment trusts (REITs) specialize in properties and other assets that ensure your tablet can stream Netflix (NFLX) content and that your company's data is secured in the cloud. As a reminder: REITs are a special type of business structure - one that requires at least 90% of taxable income be paid out to shareholders as dividends, in exchange for generous tax benefits. Many of these stocks have risen by leaps and bounds in 2019, though they're getting expensive as a result. Still, they sit smack-dab in the middle of a growth industry, and some of them remain valuable as takeover targets.",DLR,en,Kiplinger Washington Editors
