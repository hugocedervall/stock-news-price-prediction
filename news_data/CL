Companies that have laid out groundwork in the region are well positioned to reap the rewards. Arizona, Montana, and South Dakota, will also vote on whether to legalize adult-use cannabis in November. Azer has said New Jersey and Arizona are most likely to legalize. While much of the West Coast has already legalized cannabis, the same isn't true of New Jersey's neighbors, which include some of the most populous US states.

When we look ahead, are we on the path to a circular and sustainable system for packaging? From paper vs. plastic to reusable vs. single use Shopping bags have long been a focus in sustainability — from looking at greenhouse gas impacts (paper is higher) to litter (plastic has more challenges) and significant policy action.

While Dabur too managed to increase its share by 50 bps to 13%, HUL’s share dropped 80 bps to 16.4%. Nielsen said it cannot validate or verify data on brand and market share owing to strict client confidentiality policies and sensitivities in place.Analysts, however, feel Colgate didn’t step up investments to arrest the decline in market share. The company's EBITDA margins have expanded 600 bps over FY13-18, helped by benign raw material prices, lower advertising and promotion spends and higher insourcing.“Colgate has lost nearly 800 bps market share in toothpaste category over the past three years. While pace of shift towards natural products of Dabur and Patanjali might slow down, we still see a strong value proposition of natural products in the category which would make market share gains difficult despite reasonable success of Colgate’s Swarna Vedshakti,” wrote Varun Lohchab, analyst at Jefferies.This comes at a time when Patanjali, at an overall company level, has been experiencing decline in sales over the past two years due to increased competition from many rivals, mostly multinationals, rolling out natural and herbal products as well as its own distribution troubles post the GST rollout.69258179 Its oral care category, however, remains unaffected.",CL,en,The Economic Times India
