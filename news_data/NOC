S&P emini futures were last up 0.1%, extending a rally in Wednesday's stock market trading session. Nasdaq 100 emini futures rose 0.5%. Democratic candidate Joe Biden predicted a U.S. election win over President Donald Trump after pivotal victories in Michigan and Wisconsin, while the Republican incumbent sought to offset a narrowing path to re-election with lawsuits and demands for a recount. Both Trump and Biden still had paths to reach the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win as states kept counting mail-in ballots. However, Trump now has fewer options to secure a second four-year term. A surprise win by Republican Senator Susan Collins in Maine dimmed hopes by Democrats that they could get control of the U.S. Senate. ""Even if Joe Biden wins the Presidency, it looks like we are going to have a divided congress so the opportunity to have meaningful change at the fiscal level is pretty slim, and that is what is being priced into the back end of the market today,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston.

A small air leak seemed to have grown quickly, and ground control wanted to find it fast. NASA and Roscosmos, Russia's space agency, had already narrowed down the likely location of the leak to several modules on the station's Russian side. So astronaut Chris Cassidy and cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner tested those modules by shutting the hatches between each one and using an ultrasonic leak detector to collect data through the night. The tool measures noise caused by airflow too quiet for humans to hear. By Tuesday morning, they'd figured out that the leak is in the Zvezda Service Module, the main module on the station's Russian side. Zvezda provides that half of the station with oxygen and drinkable water, and it's also equipped with a machine that scrubs carbon dioxide from the air.

The test was conducted in Utah at the facilities of manufacturer Northrop Grumman. The program has been plagued with delays and cost overruns since its inception. The Space Launch System is NASA's biggest bet on the future of space exploration. It's a rocket platform capable of propelling missions (including crewed missions) to the Moon, Mars, and perhaps beyond. It's struggled with delays and budget woes in recent years but things seem to finally be coming together, and NASA was able to broadcast the test firing of one of the SLS solid rocket boosters this week in Utah. The booster, which will be one of two that will help push spacecraft up and out of Earth's atmosphere, needed to do two things during the testing. First, it had to actually light up. Second, it had to not blow up. It managed to complete both of those objectives.

The 176-foot boosters being tested — which NASA calls ""the largest, most powerful boosters ever built for flight"" — are part of the agency's Space Launch System (SLS), which it intends to use to fly astronauts to the lunar surface. It's part of a larger program called Artemis: a roughly $30 billion effort to put boots back on the moon for the first time since the 1970s. Wednesday's test involved a booster prototype built by Northrop Grumman, one of several private companies NASA has contracted to build the 365-foot-tall SLS. The prototype rumbled to life at 3:05 p.m. ET, at the company's testing facility in the hills of Promontory, Utah. It belched out an estimated 3.6 million pounds of thrust, blasting the desert with fire, smoke, and sand for 126 seconds — the exact amount of time it'd have to work during a real flight.

The high-powered space-gazing tool has been in development for decades and was originally planned to launch way back in 2007. Over time, the list of changes, delays, and missed deadlines piled up, and based on a new report from the United States Government Accountability Office, that trend is likely to continue. As Ars Technica reports, the telescope's current planned launch date of March 2021 is now little more than a pipe dream. Despite what NASA says, the government oversight group believes there's only a 12% chance that the telescope will actually meet its planned date. The main contractor working on the telescope for NASA is Northrop Grumman. Over the past few years, the US government has grown increasingly impatient with the progress (or lack thereof) being made on the telescope, with lawmakers demanding answers regarding the massive cost overruns and huge delays.

Lack of stability and the ongoing conflict between rival governments do not allow any optimism to be developed, with most international oil majors reducing their exposure, as concern rises around the civil war and its impact on the country's oil industry. With almost no progress and investment in new exploration projects, there can't be any hope that Libya will exploit its oil reserves, estimated to be the largest on the continent, any time soon. This could add another massive threat to the North African nation, as current oil production and exports cannot be maintained without any new projects becoming operational over the next couple of years. The sentiment has been deteriorating during the last couple of months, with one after the other oil major abandoning Libya's new projects. Both BP and Eni have already deferred plans to start exploration in the country.

They found it by detecting the warm glow of dust clouds heated by the formation of new stars in the galaxy. The discovery could offer clues about how huge, mature galaxies formed so quickly in the early universe — a process that defies theoretical models. NASA's upcoming James Webb Telescope will give researchers the chance to study the new galaxy in more detail. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more . A team of astronomers has accidentally discovered an invisible monster galaxy from the beginning of the universe. The researchers were taking observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, a group of 66 telescopes in Chile, when a faint bit of light appeared in the cosmos. They think that light is the glow of dust particles heated by stars forming inside the galaxy. That dust blocks other wavelengths of light, including the light from the stars themselves. So in a sense, the newly discovered galaxy is mostly invisible.

2019-06-19 10:33:00-05:00,NASA built 5 Apollo lunar landers that never launched into space. Here's what happened to the historic moon ships.,"NASA had 15 moon-landing spacecraft built for its Apollo space program in the 1960s and 1970s. Ten of those spacecraft, known as lunar modules , launched into space. Astronauts landed six of them on the moon. After Congress canceled the Apollo programs, museums put three spare lunar landers on display in Florida, New York, and Washington, DC.

When NASA made history 50 years ago by landing the first two humans on the moon , a peculiar-looking spacecraft called the lunar module made the journey possible — and survivable. The module's descent stage — lower part with a big rocket engine — took Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to the lunar surface on July 20, 1969.

This is particularly true for stressed accounts…,” a senior banker told ET.However, once the proposed regulation is executed, many midsized and smaller banks, which do not lead consortia, fear a dip in CASA (current and saving accounts) numbers that enable banks to lower cost of fund. “On one hand RBI wants discipline in opening current accounts.",NOC,en,The Economic Times India

One of the primary causes of concern has been a series of reports from NBC News claiming that ""commercial"" satellite footage shows that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has been engaging in fresh construction at their Sohae Launch Facility in preparation for an alleged missile launch or test. Not only is the use of the term ""commercial"" misleading in nature, but analysis of the photos indicates that the activity at the Sohae facility is related to deconstruction. The reports are driven by a number of entities with connections to the Central Intelligence Agency and a number of other special interests which call into credibility both the veracity of the reports and the journalistic integrity of NBC News.",NOC,en,Zero Hedge

Bush was able to announce that there was a “new sheriff in town” pledged to wipe terrorism from the face of the earth. “You’re either with us or against us,” he growled and he backed up his warning of lethal retribution with an enemies list that he called the “axis of evil.” The axis of evil identified in those days in the 2002 State of the Union Address consisted of Iraq, Iran and North Korea. Iraq, which had not yet been invaded and conquered by the American war machine, was number one on the list, with Saddam allegedly brandishing weapons of mass destruction deliverable by the feared transatlantic gliders that could easily strike the United States. Bush explained that ""Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror.
