2020-11-03 08:00:00-05:00,Plaid and Yodlee are hoping new regulation will keep banks from shutting off critical customer data that helps powers fintechs. The firms’ execs explain what’s at stake.,"Summary List Placement The relationship between banks and fintechs is complicated. Once seen as scrappy disruptors, fintechs have established themselves as a serious threat. For a majority of Americans, these consumer apps have become a key part of their financial lives. From peer-to-peer transfers to new forms of credit and no-fee bank accounts, fintechs run the gamut of personal-finance products. But the startup revolution hasn't occurred entirely independently. Fintechs still need banks, or at the very least, the data stored inside them. With many of their customers maintaining accounts at traditional financial firms, fintechs need to be able to connect and share information with their much larger peers. That's where companies like Plaid and Envestnet's Yodlee come in. These data aggregators sit in the middle, connecting third-party apps to various banks' systems. But in recent years banks have raised questions about the efficacy of these data aggregators, challenging their security practices or pushing to deny their access altogether .",ENV,en,Business Insider
