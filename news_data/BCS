The UK banking space is experiencing a push toward digital channels — driven by branch closures, consumer preference for digital, declines in cash usage, and changes brought about by the coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic is accelerating existing usage trends — like lowered cash usage — in some channels while highlighting the need for digitization in other areas. And the magnitude of the coronavirus pandemic is going to impact the lasting effects it has on changes in banking channels: If it takes a moderate course and the UK economy fully reopens within the coming months, shifts will be less significant than if the pandemic takes a severe course, where persistent public health threats due to the coronavirus will keep branches closed for an extended period.",BCS,en,Business Insider

2020-12-07 19:01:57-05:00,Net zero for banks is climate science not rocket science,"Until British banks rule out all fossil fuel funding, their climate plans will remain inadequate, argues Market Forces' campaigner Adam McGibbon Another week, another 'climate announcement' by a major bank. This year we've seen varying degrees of commitment from big lenders in the UK and across the pond, all of them inadequate and far more complicated than they need to be. Barclays has just announced how it intends to reach 'net-zero' by 2050, after facing serious investor scrutiny at the start of the year. It's created a fancy new 'methodology' called BlueTrack and introduced some inadequate reduction targets, the detail of which is unsurprisingly and conveniently tricky to untangle. But it's still just a methodology. Most importantly, the bank still hasn't made any changes to its policy on the energies it can fund. As the UK is preparing to host the UN Climate Conference in Glasgow at the end of next year, British banks are under more and more pressure to demonstrate they care about climate change.",BCS,en,BusinessGreen

While that pushes Asia’s third-largest economy into its first technical recession in records going back to 1996, it’s a sharp recovery from the record 24% contraction the previous quarter.79438523The improvements are expected to continue, with some analysts seeing the country returning to growth as soon as this quarter. The recovery from the lockdown has been stronger than expected, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das said Thursday, signaling ahead of next week’s rate decision that policy makers will keep their supportive stance.“While the farm sector remained the bright spot, supported by a good monsoon season and subsidized inputs, we think the recovery likely spread wider across the economy and is on the verge of becoming entrenched,” Rahul Bajoria, the Mumbai-based chief India economist at Barclays Plc, wrote in a report to clients.That improvement coincides with a drop in India’s daily virus cases, which have tapered off to half of its peak of more than 97,000 infections a day in mid-September.“With cases rising elsewhere, India has fallen off the top in terms of fastest growing cases as well as deaths,” said Bajoria, who sees positive growth this quarter and a full-year contraction at 6.4% -- milder than the RBI’s forecast for a 9.5% decline.The RBI has been doing the heavy lifting on providing stimulus to the economy, having cut interest rates by 115 basis points so far this year, infused liquidity and transferred billions of rupees in dividend to the government.",BCS,en,Economic Times India

A raft of restrictions on movement across the United States to help stem the spread of the virus that has already infected over 11 million people and killed more than a quarter of a million neutralized some of the euphoria that lifted markets this week. Futures on the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones were down between 0.3-0.4%, while the Nasdaq 100 diverged, rising 0.3%, as some of the technology stocks that were sold down fairly heavily on Monday recovered some ground.

2020-10-24 05:00:00-05:00,Bank of America says these are the 22 European value stocks to own — and 6 traps to avoid — given the 10% upside potential for value stocks by early next year,"Summary List Placement Value stocks have had their worst year since 1992, falling by 38% adjusting for sector bias, according to Bank of America quant strategists in a research note released on October 20. But equity analysts and quant strategists at the bank are expecting that to change going forward as obstacles for value outperformance begin to fade. ""European value versus growth has yet to price in the macro recovery,"" Bank of America equity analyst, Sebastian Raedler, said in the note. Raedler identifies two obstacles in the way of value outperformance. Firstly, bond yields have not risen meaningfully in response to improving economic macro data. Secondly, two of the big European value sectors have continued to underperform —energy and financials. He expects with a maturing economic recovery this will translate to rising bond yields and an improving earnings cycle for these lagging sectors. The removal of these obstacles should translate to a 10% upside for value versus growth stocks by the first quarter of next year, Raedler said. ""[Bank of America quant strategists] argue that the cyclical reasons for owning value have strengthened: (a) their Style Cycle and US & EM regional indicators point to a synchronized pick-up; (b) EPS Revision Ratio for value stocks is the strongest since 2018; and (c) 90% of Fund Managers expect a vaccine in place by H1 next year, which should help to lift bond yields,"" Raedler said.",BCS,en,Business Insider

And while the projected debt number stunned the market, it barely registered on the price or yield of US Treasurys for the simple reason that just weeks earlier the Fed announced it would monetize all gross debt issuance for the US when it unveiled Unlimited QE , something it has been doing since. This massive surge in debt issuance would also result in a far higher Treasury cash balance which would be used to pre-fund various fiscal stimulus programs, and as the chart below shows, that's precisely what happened with the Treasury cash balance exploding from $400BN at the end of March to an record high just above $1.7 trillion currently, an amount that is just waiting to be spent as soon as Congress gives the green light.",BCS,en,Zero Hedge

In fact, back in June, none other than Goldman's chief strategist David Kostin observed that what is keeping Goldman's clients up at night, is precisely the possibility of a Democratic sweep, and Goldman went so far to calculate the $20 hit to 2021 EPS should Biden's tax reversals pass.

The LIBOR, short for London Interbank Offered Rate, is a fluctuating short-term interest rate that influences the way other interest rates are set in the world of finance.

An estimated $350 trillion worth of outstanding loans and trading contracts around the world are based on LIBOR. What is LIBOR? Somewhat like the US federal funds rate , LIBOR is an interbank rate: It reflects the interest that major banks charge each other when borrowing for brief periods — anywhere from overnight to 12 months. Actually, there's no one LIBOR. It is based on five major currencies – the US dollar, the Swiss franc, the euro, the pound sterling, and the Japanese yen.

But this week, they made it snow. The investment banks who helped carry data-storage unicorn Snowflake to the open market on Wednesday — thereby taking part in the biggest software IPO in history — are closing out the week by celebrating with a flurry of fees, according to data reviewed by Business Insider from regulatory filings and Dealogic.

In February 2019, soon after BB&T and SunTrust announced their merger, they committed to a $100 million ""technology and innovation"" budget and planned a technology hub in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Level 3 assets can include distressed debt, some mortgage backed bonds, high risk loans and derivatives linked to things like interest rates and corporate debt. Even better? Nobody can explain the jump in the value of assets , which are marked to market using discretionary estimates that have been, in the past, at the center of several fraud stories (like Allied Capital).

The sudden rise in reports of investment scams in July may be because victims often take longer to realise they are a victim than for other types of financial scam. Barclays said many could have been waiting for confirmation of an investment which never materialised, meaning they did not realise until later on that they had been a victim of a scam. {loadposition hidden2} Barclays highlighted the tactic of scam artists to post as genuine investment firms. It said fraudsters intercept emails from legitimate firms without the victim realising, or create websites that mimic the real ones.

The committee will now be overhauled with three new external members expected to join by October and possibly changes to its targeting framework being introduced sometime next year.If inflation exceeds the upper limit of the target band for three consecutive quarters, the RBI Act requires Governor Shaktikanta Das to write a letter to the government to explain why the MPC failed to meet its goal. Average inflation in each of the first two quarters has already exceeded 6% and will likely remain elevated after consumer prices grew 6.93% in July, driven by higher food prices.77647273Price StabilityThe MPC held its first meeting in October 2016 under then-Governor Urjit Patel.",BCS,en,Economic Times India

Only this time the stakes are total, and aim at creation a universal global totalitarian system, what David Rockefeller once called a “one world government.” The powers that be periodically use war to gain major policy shifts. On behalf of the Powers That Be (PTB), World War II was orchestrated by the circles of the City of London and of Wall Street to maneuver two great obstacles - Russia and Germany - to wage a war to the death against each other, in order that those Anglo-Saxon PTB could reorganize the world geopolitical chess board to their advantage .",BCS,en,Zero Hedge

For an ‘outstanding’ ESG score, banks had to have a positive score in more than 90 per cent of the criteria. Benchmark criteria included culture and governance, risk management, reporting, targets and more. The report, ‘Responsible banking practices: benchmark study 2020’, found that over half of banks sampled showed ‘limited evidence’ of a sustainable approach across most criteria. Banks were often found to focus on environmentally responsible products, but product offerings were yet to fully address socio-economic issues. Most banks have adopted or are implementing voluntary ESG reporting standards but the majority (57 per cent) have yet to fully integrate ESG factors into their Risk Management Framework using both qualitative and quantitative approaches.",BCS,en,InstitutionAlassetManager

Insider Intelligence publishes hundreds of research reports, charts, and forecasts on the Banking industry with the Banking Briefing. You can learn more about subscribing here. Insider Intelligence forecasts that branch penetration in the UK will dip from 65.3% in 2019 to between 60% and 62% in 2024.

Penetration will tick back up in 2021 as pandemic restrictions are lifted and then steadily decline thereafter. Here are the key drivers that will inform declining branch penetration through 2024: Coronavirus-related restrictions are temporarily limiting branch access — but could drive a long-term behavioral shift.",BCS,en,Business Insider

And arguably the biggest winners have been so-called work-from-home, or WFH, stocks. Many tech companies in industries such as video conferencing and cloud storage have seen their shares easily beat the market through 2020's first half, in some cases doubling and even tripling. These companies were already enjoying stepped-up investments in software and services that enable remote work, but the COVID-19 pandemic took that shift into overdrive. Many experts believe work-from-home is a trend with legs. What began as a temporary way to keep employees safe is becoming a permanent movement for large companies including Facebook, Nationwide, Mondelez and Barclays, who see remote work as a way to reduce office rents and tap a broader talent pool. According to a Gartner Group survey, 75% of companies plan to let more employees work remotely.",BCS,en,Kiplinger Washington Editors

If you want to earn maximum rewards with the best sign-up bonuses from the top credit cards, it's important to know these restrictions before you apply for a new card. See Business Insider's list of the best rewards credit cards. When applying for a new credit card, you want to do everything in your power to increase your odds of being approved. But sometimes, even having an excellent credit score isn't enough to get an approval.

However, this description is still aspirational.

The stakes of failing to transform are high: Accenture projects that 35% of all bank revenues could be at risk from more tech-savvy competitors like fintechs as soon as 2020 for incumbents that fail to up their game.

Open banking has arrived, and it's transforming the UK's banking landscape — next up could be the world. Regulatory efforts in the UK are transforming retail banking, reshaping incumbents' relationships with customers, and easing entry for fintechs. Regulators across every continent are responding with actions of their own. Underpinning open banking initiatives is the idea that ownership of transactional data belongs to consumers instead of incumbent financial institutions. The implications of this change for established lenders in the UK are significant. For those that act, open banking presents substantial revenue-generating opportunities. But the consequences of inaction are even more severe: Business Insider Intelligence estimates that by 2024, £6.5 billion ($8.4 billion) of UK incumbents' revenues will be under threat of being scooped up by forward-thinking companies like fintechs and neobanks.","BBVA,BCS",en,Business Insider

The fact that a liquidity crisis developed in US money markets five months before the virus hit America has been forgotten. Only a rising gold price stands testament to a deeper crisis, comprised of contracting bank credit while central banks are trying to rescue the economy, fund government deficits and keep the market bubble inflated. The next problem is a crisis in the banks, wholly unexpected by investors and depositors.

Simply put, it's bad ! … and not set to get any better anytime soon.

Things could get worse for cyclicals, which are more dependent on the economy, according to Citigroup Inc. strategist Robert Buckland. He expects global EPS to fall at least 50% this year, split between cyclicals down 65% and defensives 10% to 15% lower. Overall, investors’ reactions to earnings misses have been relatively muted, according to Barclays Plc strategist Emmanuel Cau, adding that the low positioning has likely helped, but then so has the ubiquitous Powell Put. “The progressive end of lockdowns and the retention of some social-distancing measures is setting up only a moderate economic rebound in the second half and pushing an earnings recovery to the first quarter of 2021, when the comparison base will be much lower” according to Bloomberg Intelligence strategists Laurent Douillet and Tim Craighead.",BCS,en,Zero Hedge

2020-05-06 11:46:00-05:00,You're most likely to catch the coronavirus in a poorly ventilated space. That makes offices very risky.,"The coronavirus typically spreads via droplets from an infected person. A majority of coronavirus infections occur indoors when people are in sustained proximity to someone sick. This suggests that parks are low-risk spaces , while offices, prisons, and nursing homes are not. Experts recommend increasing air flow in potentially crowded, indoor spaces to lower infection risk. But employees might never return to office life as it was. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . We are all becoming accustomed to a constant internal monologue about minimizing our risk of coronavirus infection: ""Is it safe to go running?"" ""Should I dash into the pharmacy?"" ""How close is too close to stand in line?"" Scientists agree that the virus primarily spreads between people via droplets that fly through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. Evidence also increasingly shows that the risk of infection is much higher in poorly ventilated, crowded areas. So while it can be jarring to have a runner invade your 6-foot bubble, that fleeting moment is far less risky than, say, working in an office with hundreds of colleagues.",BCS,en,Business Insider

In order to understand bank credit, we must enter the mind of a banker and understand how it is created, why it is expanded and why expansion is always followed by a sharp contraction. But we have now moved on from a simplistic credit cycle model, given the global economy was already facing a tendency for bank credit to contract before the coronavirus drove supply chains into the greatest global payment crisis in history.

In a shock announcement this morning, the UK-based bank - which has come under fire from climate campaigners over its continued financial support for fossil fuel activities - said it would develop a ""new approach"" to its business and financing activities across all sectors in its portfolio. It promised to impose further restrictions on fossil fuel financing, target at least £100bn of green financing by 2030, and to provide transparent targets and regular reports to judge progress against its net zero goal starting from next year. Barclays also said it plans to invest £175m over the next five years in ""environmental innovation"" through a new Sustainable Impact Capital Initiative. ""Our new ambition to be net zero, and our commitment to aligning our financing portfolio across all sectors to the goals of the Paris Agreement, will mean we can play much more of a leading role in meeting the climate challenge and in financing energy transition,"" said Barclays' chairman Nigel Higgins. ""Ours is a clear and implementable strategy, and will be backed up with specific targets and regular reporting to ensure we implement it.",BCS,en,BusinessGreen

For nearly a week now, the housing market across the country has ground to a halt as agents have been prohibited from marketing new homes. And on Thursday, the government took things a step further, and banned visitors from viewing properties while the ""stay-at-home"" measures are still in force. The edict affects all transactions, blocking all transfers of title until further notice, while also banning evictions, it's basically forcing the entire county to stay put in whatever housing situation they have been living in. For those who don't have permanent housing arrangements, it's presumably been a struggle. But that's a relatively small slice of the population. This is about all prospective homebuyers in the UK can do right now: ""You can speak to estate agents over the phone and they will be able to give you general advice about the local property market and handle certain matters remotely but they will not be able to start actively marketing your home in the usual manner,"" the government said on Thursday night.",BCS,en,Zero Hedge

Sir Chris Hohn, founder of the USD28 billion activist-focused firm The Children’s Investment Fund (TCF), is one prominent advocate, having stepped up his campaign against companies failing to act on climate change. Earlier this month, Hohn – whose fund gained more than 40 per cent in 2019 - called on Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered to withdraw financing for new fossil fuel projects. “Investing in a company that doesn’t disclose its pollution is like investing in a company that doesn’t disclose its balance sheet,” Hohn wrote last year. “If governments won’t force disclosure, then investors can force it themselves.” The pace of change suggests ESG is no longer simply a “luxury” within the investment management industry, say some market participants.",BCS,en,Hedgeweek

The bank lowered its 2020 Brent price forecast to $43 per barrel and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price outlook to $40. The bank had previously forecast Brent prices at $59 per barrel for this year and WTI at $54, as of end-February. “Oil markets face a moment of truth as disagreement between key OPEC+ members means unhinged supplies will likely overwhelm near-term market balances amid large-scale demand destruction due to virus containment measures,“ Barclays’ analysts wrote in a note.

Now with a portfolio that also includes Bournemouth, Crystal Palace, Middlesbrough, Sheffield United, Southampton, Swansea City, Watford, West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers, a company estimated to manage almost £288bn worth of assets has emerged as the second-biggest lender behind Barclays Bank in an industry where owners continue to chase the dream. Since 2013 and encouraged by increased transparency in the game following the introduction of Uefa’s financial fair play regulations, Macquarie estimates that it has completed more than $1.5bn in loans across Europe’s major leagues, specialising in “transfer financing” and “media and sponsorship rights monetisation”.",BCS,en,The Guardian

After the update, there were several anecdotal reports that the AirPods Pro noise cancelation may have been adversely affected.

The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) made the allegations during the first day of the prosecution’s cross-examination of Thomas Kalaris, the former head of Barclays’ wealth division. Kalaris was known as the “quarterback” for Barclays’ emergency fundraising at the height of the financial crisis. In a telephone transcript read to a jury at the Old Bailey, Kalaris proposed two ways in which Barclays could meet Qatar’s demand for extra fees and secure the Gulf state’s participation in the bank’s rescue deal: interest paid on a large cash deposit in a Barclays account, or a share option deal that would allow Qatar to buy stock at a fixed price. Focusing on the first proposal, Philip Stott, a prosecuting lawyer for the SFO, claimed Kalaris was suggesting paying Qatar a very high interest rate that would not be offered to other clients as a way of funnelling extra funds to the Gulf state.",BCS,en,The Guardian

HCL took over the IT operations of Barclays and Broadcom, TCS of Transamerica, Wipro of Alight, and Infosys of Hitachi and Verizon.In such deals, customers usually identify 25-30 of their employees, who are key to their processes and operations, and who they would like the IT services company to retain. But since those employees are often not eager to transition to the Indian company — in some cases they worry that they will not be retained for long — it becomes imperative to offer them transition bonuses. Sometimes the IT services company itself wants to retain these people for the long term, considering their expertise.The bonuses range between 10% and 20% of the annual compensation, and can go up to even 30% where the domain skills are critical.",BCS,en,The Economic Times India

This was done to equate the BC charges with fees charged by banks on ATM withdrawals,” said a senior official from BCFI. “But BCs who work in rural areas have to bear the risk and equipment maintenance costs themselves, which squeezes their already wafer-thin margins.”The government, while the guidelines were being drafted, had shown intent to either fix a monthly income for BCs or set the commission at 3.15% of the transaction fee, “but that has not happened,” the source said.",BCS,en,The Economic Times India

Sadly, as the following two charts show... there's no 'there', there.

We can see what happens when stocks attempt to ""know better"" than the earnings estimates. “Market sentiment on earnings is cautious and fourth-quarter results are widely expected to disappoint,” said Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at Barclays Plc in London. “Fourth-quarter estimates have been lowered and the sharp p/e de-rating of 2018 lowers the bar for positive surprises, but we believe that full-year 2019 estimates are still too high and will see further downgrades.
