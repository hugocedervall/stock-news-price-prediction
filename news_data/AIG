2020-09-16 09:04:40-05:00,Hedge funds weighed down by “clunky” trading processes risk further hit from volatility spike,"Hedge funds weighed down by “clunky” trading processes risk further hit from volatility spike Submitted By Hugh Leask | 16/09/2020 - 3:04pm Outdated trading systems and clunky manual processes are hampering hedge funds’ efforts to swiftly execute trade orders to the market, resulting in an annual hit of some USD8 million – which could worsen in the event of renewed volatility later in the year. New analysis by TradingScreen, a New York-based software-as-a-service trading technology provider, found that hedge funds face hold-ups when processing execution orders as a result of poor system integration and slow manual inputs needed to create, validate, execute and book trades. By the time traders and portfolio managers have physically entered the information into their systems and sent orders out to market, prices may not be in their favour, the research noted. TradingScreen found that a typical mid-sized long/short equity hedge fund managing USD5 billion in assets wastes, on average, 2.5 hours per day dealing with 200 orders due to outmoded practices, which is likely leading to around USD8 million in losses every year. “With prices all over the place, no hedge fund manager wants to be offloading, for example, a large block of FTSE 100 without the required care and attention the order requires,” said Surika Vosloo, European product manager at TradingScreen.",AIG,en,Hedgeweek

SelectQuote’s offering is the latest sign of thawing in the IPO market, which was shut to most companies when the coronavirus outbreak fueled weeks of stock market volatility in March and April. Only a handful of biotechnology and blank-check companies went ahead with IPOs during this period. Since late February, the Cboe Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, has been above the 20-point threshold that most IPO hopefuls monitor to gauge investor jitters. But it has trended downwards in recent weeks, giving some companies confidence to test the market. SelectQuote allows consumers to compare insurance policies for life, auto and home insurance from providers including American International Group, Prudential Financial Inc and Liberty Mutual. The biggest IPO by a company that is neither a biotechnology firm nor special purpose acquisition company since the onset of the pandemic was by Chinese cloud computing company Kingsoft Cloud Holdings Ltd, which raised $510 million in its U.S. stock market debut earlier this month.",AIG,en,The Sun Daily

Life insurers earn much of their profit by investing customers’ premiums in bonds until claims come due. In simplest terms, when they price policies, they make assumptions about how much interest income they will earn investing these premiums years into the future. The less they earn, the more they may need to collect in premium or fees to turn a profit.

2019-05-09 03:00:04-05:00,The Corporate World Has Its Own Inequality Problem,"(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- Liberals have a blind spot about inequality. They decry disparity between individuals—the fact, for example, that the 10 richest people in America have more money than the bottom 160 million. But they overlook inequality among companies, instead viewing Big Business as a troublesome monolith. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont occasionally tarred business with a broad brush, once saying the chiefs of large multinational companies “ain’t going to like me.” The surprising truth is there’s as much inequality among large companies as there is among people. As with individuals, a handful of companies make the lion’s share of profits, while struggling companies do so poorly they actually destroy value for their shareholders and debtholders. In the middle is a stressed-out majority: unable to keep up with the best, while pressured by the desperate tactics of the worst. Inequality in the corporate world isn’t new. Perfect competition—with millions of small, roughly equal businesses battling it out on a level playing field—was never more than a teaching device in intro economics textbooks.",AIG,en,Bloomberg

2019-04-25 23:01:06-05:00,"When Hackers Strike, Property Insurance May Not Offer Protection","(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- When Mondelez International Inc., the maker of Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolate, suffered a malware attack in 2017, it thought the property insurance policy it had taken out years earlier with Zurich Insurance Group AG would help cover the more than $100 million in losses Mondelez estimated it had suffered. Zurich saw things differently. The insurer classified the attacks, which also hit servers of several other big companies, including Merck & Co. and A.P. Moller-Maersk AS, as an act of war. Since the Mondelez policy has a clause that excludes acts of war, the insurer denied the claim. Mondelez is suing Zurich for $100 million, claiming the coverage is warranted and calling the insurer’s response “unreasonable,” according to court documents. Many companies have long-standing property insurance policies that offer a payout if a cyberattack results in physical damage, but they may not cover financial damage. Many of those policies were bought years ago, before cyberattacks became almost routine, and the terms and conditions haven’t been updated, according to Lori Bailey, Zurich’s global head of cyber risk, talking about the overall market for cyber insurance.",AIG,en,Bloomberg
2019-04-25 03:00:12-05:00,The Unexpected Costs of Cooperating With the Mueller Investigation,"(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- Dimitri Simes’s name appears 134 times in the redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. Born and educated in Moscow, Simes has been a fixture in Washington since the 1970s, brokering advice and authority for contacts in both capitals. Those relationships proved helpful to the nascent presidential campaign of Donald Trump, later drawing the scrutiny of Mueller’s team. Mueller’s investigation resulted in a total of 34 indictments covering everyone from Russian hackers to Trump campaign officials, but not Simes or anyone else at his Washington think tank, the Center for the National Interest. And yet, as the probe unfolded, Simes and his staff incurred punishing legal bills during the hours they sat for interviews with the special counsel’s team. The think tank’s largest donor drastically cut his financial support earlier this year, according to four people familiar with the organization’s finances, and Simes himself dealt with unwanted public exposure.",AIG,en,Bloomberg

It’s worth the effort in terms of education but also to reveal what’s really going on. The catalog is too long to republish here in its entirety. One of the most ridiculous anecdotes, however, was pieced together in March 2016. The dollar world was a smoldering wreck, and because of that global bond yields were still falling. Liquidity hedging was prevalent as anyone might honestly expect. As a consequence, US primary dealers were hoarding UST’s coupons and bills. Their reported (net) holdings of these most prized instruments so very clearly rise and fall with each deflation/reflation cycle. But there is no such thing according to the Fed narrative. There cannot be because four QE’s caused so much “money” to be “printed” something like that would be unthinkable – if it was ever the real thing it would reveal the whole corrupt nature of moneyless monetary policy.",AIG,en,Zero Hedge
