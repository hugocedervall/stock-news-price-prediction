2020-10-07 10:10:00-05:00,Morgan Stanley expects more mega-mergers in the oil industry. Here are the 11 deals the bank says are most likely.,"Summary List Placement Hammered by a collapse in oil prices, the energy industry is entering a new phase focused on returns, which is likely to bring a wave of consolidation, analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note Wednesday. Deals could help US oil companies Exxon and Chevron diversify and build out their clean-energy assets, they said. ""European peers have begun to reposition portfolios away from oil & gas production,"" the analysts said in the note. ""Majors in the US have been slower to adapt despite sharing similar advantages of scale. Focusing on M&A in the power sector, companies with renewable development capabilities could be particularly attractive alternatives to oil & gas."" Today, the energy industry remains fragmented, the analysts said, resulting in a recent spike in deals. Most notably, Chevron acquired Noble Energy in early October through a $5 billion all-stock deal, while shale giants Devon Energy and WPX Energy announced plans to merge in late September.

2020-06-09 09:45:00-05:00,Oil prices are recovering faster than anyone expected. 4 Wall Street banks explain what that means for the energy economy — and share the stocks poised to benefit from the recovery.,"After crashing in March, the price of crude oil is recovering faster than banks initially predicted. Some producers that were forced to pare back oil production are already reversing cuts as a result. Still, don't expect oil demand to fully recover before the end of next year, analysts say. It could take even longer before US production grows. For more stories like this, sign up here for our weekly energy newsletter, Power Line . It was a devastating spring for oil markets, as some futures reached record lows and companies responded by laying off staff, slashing dividends , and cutting billions from annual budgets. But now there's some good news: The price of crude is rising fast — faster than investors expected. The US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate (WTI), posted its sharpest monthly gains on record in May. And when markets opened Tuesday morning, just days after OPEC Plus agreed to extend record supply cuts through July, WTI was trading at about $38 a barrel — up another 8% or so, since the start of June. ""The oversupply, which sent WTI oil prices into the negative earlier this year, is a thing of the past, as long as OPEC+ compliance stays strong and the oil demand recovery trajectory isn't radically altered,"" the research firm Rystad Energy said in a statement on Monday.",XEC,en,Business Insider
