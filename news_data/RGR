Gold and silver were also getting shellacked. But it wasn’t all crash and burn. First Solar, Rolls-Royce Holdings, and CoreLogic all notched double digit gains. The dollar, as measured by the dollar index, gold, silver, and most stocks, was also up. And something else was up too… Most investors likely didn’t notice that American firearm manufacturer Sturm, Ruger & Company managed to eke out a small return. Why would they? A return of 0.43 percent is nothing to write home about. Nonetheless, we contend that Ruger’s modest gain in the face of a massive selloff is something that should get the attention of investors.
