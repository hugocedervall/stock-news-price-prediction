As the day of reckoning nears, those hoping for a resolution have quickly peeled back expectations. And, as it stands right now, investors are betting heavily on a kick the can down the road-esque outcome at best. But not all hope on Wall Street is lost.

2019-03-20 16:00:18-05:00,"KFC Aims to Keep Its China Edge With AI Menu, Robot Ice Cream Maker","(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- In Shanghai’s southeastern district of Xujiahui, Colonel Sanders’s smiling visage looms over the restaurant entrance, as it does at thousands of KFC locations around the globe. But step inside, and it quickly becomes clear that this is no ordinary KFC. Customers line up before a row of touchscreen kiosks, keying in orders while a camera scans their faces to process payment in less than a second. Downstairs, a robot arm whirs to life to prepare an ice cream cone. Diners can choose the joint’s background music via app and listen to a favorite tune while they eat. So far only a few hundred KFC locations have been similarly tricked out. But Yum China Holdings Inc. says 86 percent of transactions are already cashless and about half of orders are placed via mobile app or digital kiosk at its more than 8,400 KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell restaurants. The next step is to harvest data from the more than 180 million Chinese who belong to KFC and Pizza Hut loyalty programs and use artificial intelligence to customize a menu for each diner based on preferences and local tastes.","YUM,YUMC",en,Bloomberg
