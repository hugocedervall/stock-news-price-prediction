2020-11-11 07:00:00-05:00,A Looming Transmission Crunch for the U.S. East Coast’s Offshore Wind Ambitions,"Building the transmission grid needed to grow U.S. renewable energy capacity is complicated enough on solid ground. It’s even more complicated for the nascent offshore wind industry. But if East Coast states want to hit goals of nearly 29 gigawatts of offshore wind in the next 15 years, they’ll need to find solutions. A key first step will be working with federal regulators and regional grid operators to find ways to share the costs of building offshore transmission, rather than going it alone. That’s the key message from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's technical conference on offshore wind integration last month , featuring representatives from utilities and states trying to plan ahead for an unprecedented undersea high voltage transmission system buildout. Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts are calling for a combined 28.5 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2035. That will cost roughly $100 billion, of which about $15 billion and $20 billion will go into offshore transmission, according to an October report from the Business Network for Offshore Wind advocacy group.",ED,en,Green Technology Media

""These detectors urge anyone nearby to leave and prompt a swift response from our gas crews and the local fire department so that they can shut off the gas, find the leak and make it safe.""

Chef Ed explains the logistics behind catching and shipping lobsters that contribute to the high cost of serving them in his restaurant. Following is a transcript of the video. Narrator : It's no secret that lobsters are pricey. And a standard lobster dinner in a restaurant can set you back $38 or more. Lobsters are considered a gourmet dish today, but there was a time when they were known as the cockroaches of the sea and even served to prisoners. So when did lobsters become such a delicacy?

For example, if you are a senior citizen with a Rs 4 lakh cover and your renewal premium shoots up to Rs 54,000 per annum, let the policy lapse, particularly if it also comes with co-pay or room rent restrictions. “If the premium amount crosses 10% of the sum insured, study its utility before taking a call.",ED,en,The Economic Times India

It would also coincide nicely with my Elliott Wave “5 count” that would speak of an “ABC” correction. Those are minor “cool offs” not substantial sell offs. However, also recall from my note last week that in the past 20 years, the S&P future has only been this extended to its 50-day moving average two times. Both times saw significant corrections of ~10%. So if you flew down from the dark side of the moon, ignored fundamentals/positioning, looked at the chart of S&P mini’s, saw RSI’s overbought, and momentum indicators starting to roll over; you would expect some sort of correction near that 2798 level. The only question would be how deep.
