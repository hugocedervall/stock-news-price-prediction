2020-12-09 22:06:40-05:00,Citigroup trial reveals a chain of gaffes,"Three employees working for Citigroup Inc. told a federal judge they made errors in processing an interest payment that resulted in the mistaken transfer of $900 million to Revlon Inc. lenders.Details of the blunder were revealed as the workers took the stand on the first day of a trial in which the bank is seeking to recover more than $500 million from recipients that say they were owed it.The trial is expected to shine a spotlight on one of the biggest and most embarrassing banking errors in recent memory -- one that has already forced Citi to explain its mistake to federal regulators and tighten its internal controls. The case is being closely followed on Wall Street, especially in the syndicated loan industry. A trade group has argued that a win for the creditors could expose banks that facilitate wire transfers and serve as administrative agents to unnecessary risk.At the heart of the breakdown was a system known inside the bank as the “six eyes” approval process. Under the six-eyes protocol, three people must be involved in reviewing and executing wire transfers that originate in the asset-based transitional finance group.The SystemIn the first step, an employee designated as a “maker” manually puts payment information into the bank’s Flexcube loan processing program.","REV,C",en,Economic Times India

The bank is locked in a battle with a dozen hedge funds and investment firms who have refused to return the money the bank mistakenly sent on behalf of cosmetics firm Revlon last month. While much of that fighting is playing out in the courts , the bank is also making sure to press its advantage in the rough and tumble world of trading. Managers at the bank have instructed sales and trading staff to essentially freeze out the funds from services they rely on to make investment decisions and bundle new bonds, according to three people with knowledge of the policies. Employees have been told to stop sending pricing information on bonds — known on Wall Street as 'runs' — and remove those clients from any distribution lists they may have been on, according to one of the people. In some cases, salespeople and traders are ignoring Bloomberg chat messages or refusing to return calls from those clients, the person said, describing it as a directive.",REV,en,Business Insider

When Corbat named Fraser as president last October, he said he looked forward to ""leading our firm in the coming years.""
