SEE MORE Protect Your Wealth with Smart Risk Management Strategies Yes, the stocks in your 401(k) or IRA are bound to dip, or even dive, from day to day or month to month. And that can be scary. However, disciplined investors historically have been able to count on the right mix of high-quality stocks and the magic of compounding to grow their money over the long term. But what about saving and investing for goals (or needs) that have a tighter timeline? Where can you put your money for short-term safekeeping and still get a competitive rate of return? Ah, the Good Old Days It’s been decades since you could waltz into a bank or credit union and buy a nice, safe certificate of deposit with an interest rate in the double digits. These days, you’re lucky to get 1.25% for a 36-month CD. Bonds can be similarly disappointing.

Now, the app's US future hangs on whether Trump walks back an executive order.","Summary List Placement TikTok won't sell its US business after all, a report suggests — meaning it will have to convince President Donald Trump to walk back an executive order demanding its sale to a US company by November 12. Reuters reported Monday that TikTok was abandoning plans to sell off its US operations, and was instead striking a deal to make Oracle, the US tech giant, its ""technology partner."" This chimes with a Wall Street Journal report from Sunday that said Oracle would be announced as TikTok's ""trusted tech partner."" Microsoft announced on Sunday that TikTok's parent company ByteDance had rejected its bid to buy TikTok US. Oracle was previously reported to be a potential buyer. Sources told Reuters that as a technology partner, Oracle would manage TikTok's US user data. It is not clear how this would work: TikTok says it keeps all its worldwide user data on US servers, with backups in Singapore.
