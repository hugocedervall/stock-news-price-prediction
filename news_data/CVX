2020-12-08 08:05:00-05:00,Goldman Sachs highlights the top 25 dividend issuers on the S&P 500 to buy as it expects their payouts to rebound next year and keep growing over the next decade,"Summary List Placement As many Wall Street strategists have called it, November was truly a month to remember. Thanks to positive vaccine news, the S&P 500 rose nearly 11% to deliver some of its best gains in the past 30 years while out-of-favor value stocks staged a massive comeback from their underperformance in the last decade or more. Since Pfizer's early November announcement that its vaccine had a 90%+ efficacy rate , Goldman Sachs' long/short value factor, which underperformed for most of the last four years, has surged 12% as of December 3, according to a Monday client note. For investors who have missed the value train, there are still other opportunities that have lagged the market but are well-positioned for the post-pandemic economy. Aside from cyclically oriented value stocks, S&P 500 dividend futures remain an attractive opportunity that trades at significant discounts, Chief US Equity Strategist David Kostin said in the note. While realized S&P 500 dividends per share fell by 5.6% year-over-year in the third quarter, many companies such as Darden Restaurants (DRI), Marathon Oil (MRO), and Estee Lauder (EL) that had suspended dividend payments earlier in the year due to COVID-19 impacts have now resumed, Kostin explained.",CVX,en,Business Insider

Or is that going to be hard for them to do, having just done this rulemaking?” asks Jeffrey Naimon, partner, Buckley LLP. First proposed in July, the true lender rule determines when a national bank makes a loan and is the “true lender” in the context of a third party partnership. According to an announcement by the OCC on October 27, the true lender rule is an attempt to assuage legal uncertainty surrounding bank-nonbank relationships which could discourage partnerships moving forward. “What advocates want is not to have an OCC rule that’s simple and clear – they want it to be complicated because they want lenders and then purchasers of loans, the secondary market, to be worried that there’s a big risk that the loans aren’t enforceable.",CVX,en,bobsguide

What’s interesting as the country’s momentous day begins is that the “horsemen of risk” aren’t really charging out of the gate. Gold is up a little, but bonds and volatility are both lower and Monday’s stock market rally continued overnight. The relaxed approach so far might reflect widespread market belief that once the election is over, fiscal stimulus hopes could reignite. The market is basically saying that whoever gets in, it will be comfortable, and that the winner—whoever it is—is likely to spend money. Though Wall Street is rallying now, it’s gone up and down a lot lately, so there’s no guarantee of early strength lasting. Volume has been thin lately and remains that way, and when volume is low it’s easier to push things around. It’s unlikely, though, that we’ll see people step in and take a big stand right here ahead of the election.

But there’s been little mention of what the energy sector went through at the same time and how it suddenly looks so familiar. History’s repeating itself as it appears energy can’t attract investors -- again. Then as now, the backdrop to energy’s M&A boom is a collapse in oil prices. The difference this time, however, is the deals are happening at a quarter of the traditional premiums.

The low-premium, all-stock deal comes as many US shale companies have been mired in losses due to weak crude prices and, unlike in past downturns, have struggled to raise new capital to restructure heavy debts. The deal swaps 1.46 shares of ConocoPhillips for each Concho share, an about 1.5% premium over its Friday price. Concho shares on Monday morning were up a fraction at US$48.65. They sold for as much as US$93 a share in January before the Covid-19 pandemic cut oil demand and prices. ""Size, Scope and scale"" has become more important,"" said Concho chief executive Timothy Leach, who once the deal closes will run the combined company's US production excluding Alaska. ""This combination with ConocoPhillips was the best thing for our shareholders.""

The Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) - which represents 12 of the world's largest oil and gas companies including BP, Shell, Exxon, Chevron, Aramco, and Petrobras - on Friday revealed it is funding research alongside Stena Bulk into mobile carbon capture on board ships out at sea. The project aims to evaluate the technical and economic challenges involved in capturing CO2 from ships cruising the oceans, and is in part an extension to OGCI member Saudi Aramco's research which it claims has successfully demonstrated carbon capture on board heavy-duty trucks on roads, it said. ""Carbon capture will play an important role in reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions, but there's no reason it needs to be limited to stationary applications,"" said Michael Traver, head of OGCI's transport workstream. ""Expanding carbon capture to long distance marine shipping could help accelerate its use, while addressing a difficult to abate sector of the transport industry.""

In the aftermath of the report, Swiss bank UBS and Netherlands-based Rabobank scrambled to state that they had stopped financing Amazonian oil, either wholly or in part, and Natixis and ING issued hasty pledges to “look into” the report’s findings.",CVX,en,InstitutionAlassetManager

Unprecedented Times With some labeling, the situation as ""apocalyptical"", the least lurid description is ""unprecedented"". Oil prices have been the lowest in almost two decades, with even worse potentially on the way. This latest cyclical oil shock is hitting an industry whose days are counted. But the world's economy and infrastructure is still heavily invested in fossil fuels to a truly staggering level. This means oil has enormous inertia.

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Apple CEO Tim Cook will attempt to make their case as to why their firms aren't infringing on the competition in a hearing Wednesday. The hearing is part of a yearlong congressional investigation into online market competition. The ongoing investigation could eventually lead to more specific legislation designed to keep tech companies from growing too big and mighty — just like how three original antitrust laws began reining in the oil and railroad companies over 100 years ago.

We’re talking about a quarter where the price of U.S. crude oil averaged $28 a barrel, the lowest for any three-month period in nearly two decades. In one strange confluence of events, crude oil even traded negative for a brief period. This is something never seen before. Crude rebounded to back near $40 a barrel by the end of Q2 and remains right around there as of mid-July, still not enough to rescue the sector from what are likely to be horrific earnings results. As of last week, research firm FactSet pegged the average Q2 earnings per share loss for S&P 500 Energy firms at 149.9% vs. a year ago. Keep in mind that Energy wasn’t exactly tearing up the pea patch even in 2019, before COVID-19 came along. So we’re talking about a sector that, for lack of better words, can be called bruised and battered. That goes across all sub-sectors of Energy, though losses are projected to be worse for some parts than others.",CVX,en,Benzinga Feeds

The OGCI said the range was ""consistent with the reduction needed across the oil and gas industry by 2025 to support the Paris Agreement goals"" and would result in a reduction of between 36 and 52 million tonnes of CO2e per year by 2025, assuming constant levels of marketed oil and gas production.",CVX,en,BusinessGreen

The $10 billion identity security market identifies users of devices, apps, and networks without passwords, via pings to other devices or other means. Remote work sped up big companies' migration to identity security, which has kicked off other key changes, Durand says. The changes will ultimately bring a new approach to automated security that lets users easily control their privacy in one place. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . The coronavirus crisis has changed corporate cybersecurity. As workers migrated to their homes, there was suddenly no walled garden of security for big companies accustomed to protecting a network perimeter. They needed the ability to identify their workers wherever they were, and on whatever device. Passwords were no longer enough. Companies started turning to identity security, a relatively new, $10 billion market which relies on multi-factor authentication to give people access to computer systems or websites without using passwords, which are a security weak-point.",CVX,en,Business Insider

Now Exxon is the only major firm still backing the biofuel, which several top algae scientists say is destined to flop. (XOM)","In the late 2000s, algae biofuel looked like the fuel of the future. It was promoted by some of the world's largest oil companies, such as Shell, BP, and Exxon. But in the years since, these companies have been unable to make the economics of algae competitive with those of crude oil. Today, Exxon Mobil is the only major oil firm still backing algae biofuels in a big way. It's invested more than $300 million in biofuels research in the past decade. Some critics call Exxon's project greenwashing, pointing out that it's spending just a sliver of its budget on biofuels. Others say these fuels are becoming irrelevant in an increasingly electric world. Exxon and its partner, the unicorn startup Synthetic Genomics Inc., tell a different story. SGI says new genetic technologies and government incentives to curb carbon emissions could make algae biofuel economical.

At the same time, we collectively were searching for data to drive lifesaving decision-making. Close all business and keep people inside homes? Or allow some degree of freedom? What would be the exact growth curve of virus cases, and most important, how could we flatten it? By early April, a consensus had emerged around the role of accurate data, even if it could not help contain a first wave of infections. This lesson on the importance of actionable data did not go unnoticed for those of us working on industrial decarbonization. With growing consensus on the gravity of the climate crisis, countries and companies are adopting carbon reduction targets. If we are to learn from the pandemic, there’s one critical element for any effort to have a chance of success. Less catchy than a target reopening date, and perhaps more like an immunologist telling you to get tested: Do we have the right data to act upon?",CVX,en,GreenBiz

2020-05-21 10:00:00-05:00,Why US Shale Is Too Important To Fail,"Why US Shale Is Too Important To Fail Tyler Durden Thu, 05/21/2020 - 11:00 Authored by Steve Watkins via OilPrice.com, It may well be the case that the U.S. shale sector has cut over US$50 billion from its planned spending this year, the number of operating rigs has fallen by 40 per cent in the past four weeks, and output has fallen by nearly one million barrels per day (bpd) over the same period. It is equally true, though, that what all these reports overlook is that the shale oil (and gas) sector is too important from a geopolitical and economic perspective to the world standing of the U.S. for it to be allowed to fail, and all other considerations are secondary. In reality, the U.S. shale sector is set to emerge stronger, and earlier, than the vast majority of people think. Ever since the 1973 Oil Crisis - when Saudi Arabia pressured OPEC members plus Egypt, Syria, and Tunisia to embargo oil exports to the U.S. (and the U.K., Japan, Canada, and the Netherlands) in response to the U.S.’s supplying of arms to Israel in the Yom Kippur War – the U.S. had been itching for a way to end its energy dependence on other countries.",CVX,en,Zero Hedge

The Norwegian consultancy said, as quoted by Bloomberg, that drilling new wells would be loss-making for more than 100 companies. Just four shale drillers - Exxon, Chevron, Occidental, and Crownquest - can drill new wells at a profit at $31 per barrel of West Texas Intermediate. The problem is the nature of shale oil wells: while quick to start production and expand it, they are also quick to run out of oil, so drillers need to keep drilling new ones to maintain production , which is what U.S. shale patch players have been doing for years. However, this has affected investor returns, Bloomberg notes, and now it is affecting spending plans. “Companies should not be burning capital to be keeping the production base at an unsustainable level,” Tom Loughrey from shale oil data company Friezo Loughrey Oil Well Partners LLC told Bloomberg. “This is swing production -- and that means you’re going to have to swing down.” The situation is more positive for drilled but uncompleted wells, according to Rystad.",CVX,en,Zero Hedge

2020-03-10 10:47:53-05:00,Today's Pickup: Chevron Delo Touring Truck Focuses On Role Oil Plays In DPF Clogging,"Good day, Since launching its Delo 600 ADF diesel oil in November 2019, Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX ) has been promoting the oil's capability to improve diesel particulate filter performance (DPF) and extend the time between DPF cleanings. At the Technology & Maintenance Council's annual meeting last month in Atlanta, Chevron showed off its Delo touring truck, which will travel the country and highlight the benefits of the Delo brand overall, and the Delo 600 ADF in particular. James Booth, North American sector manager for Delo, told FreightWaves that 90% of ash that clogs DPFs comes from the metallic elements added to lubricants that keep engines running smoothly. Even though drivers may run regeneration on their DPF, that only burns away soot and not the ash, which must be removed manually. Reducing the ash buildup can lead to longer timeframes between manual DPF cleanings, Booth said, noting that most recommendations call for DPF cleaning every 435,000 miles for on-highway vehicles. ""What we find in the field is quite different,"" he said. ""We're seeing DPFs needing to be cleaned every 225,000 miles."" Current heavy-duty engine oils are formulated up to the API CK-4 limit of 1% sulfated ash, but Chevron said its Delo 600 ADF is formulated to 0.4% sulfated ash.",CVX,en,Benzinga Feeds

Japan remains a major financier and exporter of coal power infrastructure to emerging economies across South East Asia, prompting criticism from campaigners and some governments. Reuters quoted Koizumi as saying that global criticism of Japan's ""addiction to coal"" was cutting through and had helped make the case for the review. ""The international community sees Japan as not moving an inch on this, so whether we take action or not will mean a lot,"" he said.

India accounted for about a third of Venezuela's oil shipments in January. The move comes as U.S. President Donald Trump warned in New Delhi this week of an increase in sanctions in a bid to oust Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, whose 2018 re-election was considered a sham by most Western countries.

Chevron wrote down between $10 billion and $11 billion in assets. It was believed to be the largest writedown in recent energy industry history, and it set the usual social media crowd abuzz with warnings that it was yet another sign of the end of the hydrocarbon age, with renewables continuing to push aside old-line sources of energy. Chevron's writedowns were overwhelmingly focused on its natural gas assets, not its crude oil or refining activities. The underlying reason for the writedown was that the U.S. keeps pumping out massive quantities of natural gas far in excess of its ability to find new markets domestically or, more importantly, in other countries through exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG.)

The impairment is a sign that the waters are getting pretty rough for the oil and gas industry , due to a combination of supply surpluses, low prices, the struggling and unproven business case for large-scale shale drilling, and the looming threat of peak demand. The write down comes as Chevron lowered its long-term forecast for oil and gas prices, which directly impacted the value of its assets. “We have to make the tough choices to high-grade our portfolio and invest in the highest-return projects in the world we see ahead of us, and that’s a different world than the one that lies behind us,” Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal . The WSJ says the admission that billions of dollars’ worth of assets are worth a lot less than previously thought could force others to “publicly reassess the value of their holdings in the face of a global supply glut and growing investor concerns about the long-term future of fossil fuels.” The write down is also an indictment of shale gas drilling in Appalachia.",CVX,en,Zero Hedge

2019-12-10 22:16:11-05:00,"Chevron slashes asset value by $10-$11bn on low oil, gas prices","NEW YORK: Chevron announced Tuesday it will slash the value of its assets by $10 billion to $11 billion due to weaker oil and natural gas prices that prompted the company to consider abandoning some projects. The move hit a number of areas, including gas-related projects in the Appalachian region in the United States, a Canadian liquefied natural gas project and an oil-rich project in the Gulf of Mexico. The company also said it is weighing ""strategic alternatives,"" including divestment, for some of the assets. The downgrade reflects a weakening commodity price outlook that last week prompted the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to deepen output cuts to defend oil prices amid sluggish global economic growth. Natural gas prices also look vulnerable, due in part to a glut of supply following heavy investment in shale-rich projects like the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia where Chevron operates. Chevron said it plans a $20 billion capital budget for 2020, flat with the level in both 2018 and 2019. ""We are positioning Chevron to win in any environment by ratably investing in the highest-return, lowest-risk projects in our portfolio,"" Chevron Chief Executive Michael Wirth said in a news release.

In an exclusive interview with Business Insider, he discussed why he's now leaning into the not-so-quality end of the credit spectrum, and shared other opportunities he sees. Click here for more BI Prime stories . Recession anxiety has been one of the defining market themes of 2019. The yield-curve inversion , trade war, and even the sheer record length of this expansion gave investors jitters about a downturn that has so far failed to materialize. Investors were naturally concerned that companies with the weakest credit ratings and largest piles of debt would run into the most trouble. Amid this anxiety, managers of the Goldman Sachs Income Builder Fund saw an opportunity to lean into corporate credit; the fund invests in a mix of credit and equities. But it wasn't just any debt: they were focused on companies that had demonstrated they can generate strong cash flow and pay down their debt.

2019-03-13 16:45:00-05:00,Will U.S. Supermajors Form A New Oil Cartel?,"Authored by Tsvetana Paraskova via Oilprice.com, The ambitious shale growth plans of the U.S. supermajors could in the future allow them to control so much of U.S. shale oil production that they could also control the price of the U.S. light tight oil going to foreign markets in an ‘OPEC of their own kind,’ Investing.com quoted John Kilduff, founding partner at Again Capital, as saying. If the U.S. supermajors, such as Exxon and Chevron, end up controlling a lot of the U.S. shale production with their plans to significantly boost Permian production, and if smaller shale players bleed cash and decide to sell acreage and operations to Big Oil, then supermajors could be the ones determining the price of light crude oil, according to Kilduff. Exxon and Chevron both announced increased targets for their Permian production last week. Chevron now sees its Permian unconventional net oil-equivalent production rising to 600,000 bpd by the end of 2020, and to 900,000 bpd by the end of 2023. Exxon revised up its Permian growth plans to produce more than 1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day by as early as 2024, which would be an increase of almost 80 percent.",CVX,en,Zero Hedge

Although far from discovering some new source of alpha, according to Goldman's analysis of the latest batch of 13F filings, the recent strong hedge fund returns have benefited from the outperformance of the most popular long positions as well as the decision to increase net length ahead of the equity market bottom in December 2018. Furthermore, the relative performance of Goldman's Hedge Fund VIP basket and hedge fund net long exposure each bottomed in the days before the S&P 500 reached its low on December 24. So far in 2019, the VIP basket, which tracks the most popular long positions, has returned +14%, outperforming both the S&P 500 (+11%) and Goldman's basket of the largest short positions (GSTHVISP, +7%), which is to be expected in light of the massive short squeeze that has taken place in the past 9 weeks.","CVX,CVS",en,Zero Hedge

In a declaration issued by the group, the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Paraguay and Peru ""reiterate their recognition and support for Juan Guaidó"" and called on the international community ""to take measures to prevent the Maduro regime from conducting financial and trade transactions abroad, from having access to Venezuela's international assets and from doing business in oil, gold and other assets,"" according to the BBC . And in the latest sign that military conflict remains a possibility (after all, both President Trump and National Security Advisor John Bolton have insisted that the door to a military intervention is still open), when asked about whether a civil war is inevitable, Maduro replied that ""no one could answer that question with certainty.""

The race for top LNG global producer comes as global markets for the super-cooled fuel morphs from usually distasteful (from the buyer’s perspective) over-reliance on long-standing 20-year restrictive off-take agreements to a mix of long-term agreements, mid-term deals, short and pure spot deals, while a myriad of players, including trading houses like Trafigura, Vitol, Gunvor and Glencore are changing market fundamentals. These changes will increasingly see the fuel trade more like a real commodity in some ways similar to the world’s top two traded commodities: crude oil and iron ore. These top four LNG trading houses, for their part, traded approximately 27 mt of LNG in 2017- - around nine percent of total LNG sold worldwide, while the amount in 2018 increased as these four heavyweights were joined by even more traders of all sizes.",CVX,en,Zero Hedge
