2020-11-18 10:30:00-05:00,Cutting the ‘Total Cost of Electrification’ for EV Bus and Truck Fleets,"Electric trucks and buses may be approaching cost parity with their fossil-fueled counterparts, and they’re certainly cheaper to fuel over the long run — and that’s not counting their carbon and pollution emissions benefits. But that’s just a slice of the costs of switching bus and truck fleets from fossil fuels to batteries. Unexpected costs and bottlenecks in charging infrastructure, fleet operations and maintenance, and permitting and financing weigh on cities and states mandating electric bus fleets, or private companies with large-scale delivery truck electrification goals. Solving for this “total cost of electrification” equation will be a critical step in pushing EV trucks and buses from the margins to the mainstream in the coming decade, according to a report released Wednesday by Environmental Defense Fund, MJ Bradley and Vivid Economics. “We’re seeing the technology increasingly ready, and capital increasingly eager to invest in sustainability” via fleet electrification, Andy Darrell, EDF’s chief of global energy and finance strategy, said in an interview. “And yet the deployment, especially in the medium and heavy-duty sector, might not be moving as quickly as we’d like to achieve big climate goals.” Estimates on the global market for electric trucks and buses range into the tens of billions of dollars over the coming decade, he noted.",BUD,en,Green Technology Media

As a reminder, while the Fed pre-announced its intention to purchase up to $750BN in corporate bond (including certain fallen-angel junk bonds) in March, it started purchasing bonds in May, and bond ETFs in June (among which such mainstays as LQD and HYG). By directly entering the corporate bond market - something none of his predecessors dared to do even at the depths of the financial crisis - Powell created what many believe, as GLJ's Gordon Johnson writes, ""the biggest corporate bond bubble, and junk bond bubble, in history (and that all happened before the Fed even started buying)."" And, as expected, bond prices, stocks, and ETFs all surged - completely disconnected from fundamentals - while yields plunged, as everyone was trying to front-run the Fed’s pending massive purchases.",BUD,en,Zero Hedge

At $5.5 billion, the 38-year-old serial entrepreneur's worth is roughly five-times what the magazine estimated in April 2020, fueled by a soaring rise in his company's stock price. Since going public in June (the first in a long line of reverse mergers in the industry) Nikola's market value has soared — leaving many analysts scratching their heads . But the company continues to find new catalysts for growth, adding an investment from General Motors to its list of deals that include companies like Anheuser Busch. Milton is also one of the most public faces of the company, despite transitioning from the C-suite to a chairman role as part of the public listing.

2020-06-13 01:25:21-05:00,Mahindra courts trouble over Jeep copy,"DETROIT: A U.S. regulator ruled that India's Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd infringed upon the intellectual property rights of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's (FCA) Jeep brand, barring the sale of the vehicles in question. The International Trade Commission, in a decision released late Thursday, said Mahindra's Roxor off-road utility vehicle violated the ""trade dress"" of FCA's Jeep Wrangler SUV. The ITC issued a limited exclusion order prohibiting sale or import of the infringing vehicles and parts, as well as a cease and desist order to Mahindra and its North American unit. Trade dress consists of the unique characteristics that make a product stand apart and is generally accepted as identified with that product by the public. For example, FCA sees the Jeep Wrangler's boxy body shape, front grille and round headlights as distinct to the brand. The order is effective immediately, but the U.S. Trade Representative has 60 days to potentially disapprove for policy reasons. The ITC, which initially opened its investigation in September 2018, had been reviewing an administrative law judge's initial determination from last November.",BUD,en,Economic Times India

2020-06-12 03:44:57-05:00,From beer to clothing : Budweiser diversifies into fashion apparel to beat pandemic blues,"Bengaluru: Anheuser Busch InBev, the world biggest brewer, has set up a new unit to enter fashion clothing segment, hoping to build brands in a market where liquor advertising is banned. The move comes at a time when both apparel and beer market have shrunk after prolonged closure of outlets that sell them.The new retail firm, Budweiser Streetwear Co will make apparel and face masks and has partnered fashion marketplace Myntra to sell the brand. “The diversification will help us explore a new business line with our patrons as well as build a new consumer base,” said Kartikeya Sharma, South Asia president at AB InBev that had earlier tied-up with designers to launch limited range of street wear collection.The in-house brand will sell T-shirts, sweatshirts, tops and track pants for younger consumers. The company's original launch plan during Jan-March quarter, was hindered due to the pandemic that forced government to lockdown most non-essential operations. While liquor retailing was re-opened, high taxes led to a sharp fall in the beer category.“With Unlock 1.0 in action, our consumers are seeking fresh opportunities to adapt to the new reality,” said Sharma indicating it is early to give an outlook on revenues for the new segment.With a median population age of about 27 years, India is estimated to have about 390 million millennials and about 440 million in the Gen-Z cohort, according to a study by consulting firm Deloitte.Fashion etailer Myntra launched street wear as a separate vertical in 2017 and has about 200 such brands.",BUD,en,Economic Times India

For instance, a 650 ml bottle of strong beer that used to cost Rs 125 during pre-Covid-19 times, is currently being retailed for Rs 170 in West Bengal, while in Andhra Pradesh, the price has shot up to Rs 220 from Rs 130.As a result, beer volumes plunged 94% in West Bengal and 64% in Karnataka, a key market, said senior industry executives, quoting excise data.",BUD,en,Economic Times India

The Belgium-based brewer, weighed down with some $100 billion net debt after its 2016 acquisition of rival SABMiller, has been selling assets and took its Asian business public this year to reduce debt and focus on other fast-growing markets.

The problem, according to Facebook and outside experts, is privacy: providing academics with even anonymized data about the links that users share on the platform—crucial to understanding how falsities spread—could in theory harm or identify individual users. The social networking giant is working to establish a template for sharing the data that ensures privacy, but academics are worried about the implications of the scrubbed data. Now the funders—who include the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, The Charles Koch Foundation, Omidyar Network’s Tech and Society Solutions Lab, and The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation—are reconsidering their commitment, putting some projects in jeopardy. “Without additional data, empirical investigations of social media manipulation in 2020 will not be possible,” says Tom Glaisyer, managing director of the Public Square program at the Democracy Fund, another of the project’s funders. “A healthy democracy needs a well-functioning digital public square and researchers need access to additional data if we are to have an election cycle that the American people can trust.” The effort was launched last spring with great fanfare by Facebook and with the establishment of an independent nonprofit, Social Science One, which is designed to ensure that outside researchers can trust the data and retain academic freedom.",BUD,en,Fast Company

The move enabled it to move faster, gain more control of its data, make faster decisions, and cut costs by 20%, said CMO Jochen Koedijk. But as the trend to take marketing in-house accelerates, so do the growing pains associated with managing internal agencies, according to a new ANA report. Click here for more BI Prime stories. When Jochen Koedijk took over marketing for home security company ADT last summer, he found a company with a reputation for trust and reliability but an image that didn't match the contemporary technology it provides. The CMO decided that to update the company's image, he had to change it from the inside by instilling a performance marketing culture, drawing from his experience at companies including Chewy.com and Amazon. Starting last fall, he dropped the company's 15 media agencies, including Horizon Media, iProspect, and Harte Hanks, and brought all its media planning and buying in-house.

2019-07-15 01:16:43-05:00,Why Budweiser and its bankers failed to sell the king of IPOs,"By Thomas Buckley, Bruce Einhorn and Crystal TseFor months, executives from Anheuser-Busch InBev NV raced to prepare for a listing of its Asian subsidiary, Budweiser Brewing Company APAC. It was to be this year’s biggest initial public offering and would surpass Uber Technologies Inc.’s $8.1 billion share sale.The hope had been that the Belgian company’s leading position in the premium beer market in China -- with its millions of drinkers -- would justify a target to raise as much as $9.8 billion, for a valuation of $64 billion. But on Friday, AB InBev discovered that wasn’t enough to convince investors to splurge on the King of Beers, forcing it to dial back its ambitions and shelve plans for the mammoth IPO in Hong Kong.AB InBev’s setback can be explained at least partly by shifting trends in China, where younger consumers are increasingly moving away from traditional beers toward higher-priced craft brews and cocktails. Meanwhile, competition in China is spiking after rival Heineken NV forged a blockbuster deal with a state-owned company.",BUD,en,The Economic Times India

Beverage and cannabis companies striking deals to gain market access. New technologies could snag significant market share. Once viewed as wild conjecture for the future of cannabis markets, forecasts in 2015 fell severely short of actuality. At that time, consensus was that Canada could reach CA$2.8 billion in legal sales by 2020. Sage prognosticators now say that the market may exceed CA$7 billion in 2019 . Catering to the tastes of market demographics, intense interest is now focused on the cannabis-infused beverages market. Not even legal in Canada until this fall, the infused beverage market is already pegged to reach a mind-boggling CA$4.4 billion within five years.

Meanwhile, other countries which have yet to take that larger step have begun to decriminalize the plant as well as study its potential benefits. Despite this growing international movement, the U.S. still dominates the overall industry, with states such as California and Colorado recognized as the main drivers. Specifically, California and Colorado collectively delivered over USD 3 Billion in revenue in 2017 as these two states are among the most mature marketplaces in the world. California became the first state to legalize medical cannabis back in the 1990's with the approval of Proposition 215, while Colorado legalized medicinal use in 2000. Throughout the next decade, a smattering of states began to legalize medical cannabis. Then, in 2012, Colorado and Washington became the first two states to legalize recreational use following the passage of Amendment 64 and Initiative 502.",BUD,en,Benzinga

And despite the recovery in 2019, many of these same stocks still sport yields that are far better than their historical averages. But while some of these represent true bargains, some are dividend traps - high-yielding companies hampered by excessive risk and/or fading prospects. Dividend traps entice with rich yields almost like a siren song, only to disappoint later with dividend cuts. Even well-known companies aren't immune. Consider General Electric (GE), which once was among the bluest of blue chips but has slashed its payout twice in as many years. Another familiar name, Anheuser Busch InBev (BUD), halved its dividend in October because it had to deal with onerous debt.
