They think it's good for them. That candy — colorful, chewy, shaped like orange slices and teddy bears — is the gummy vitamin. Shmerling, who's been a rheumatologist in the Boston area for three decades and is a professor at Harvard Medical School, said some of his patients were taking a dozen supplements, gummy or otherwise, every day. ""Half of them, they're not even sure what it's for,"" he said. It's not the sugar in each vitamin that concerns him, although with an average of 3 grams a serving , it adds up. Rather, Shmerling thinks his patients should simply eat better. Instead of, say, buying a $55 pack of gummies made with blue algae, wheatgrass, barley, and other veggies, they should probably just eat their veggies. It's an amusing juxtaposition — adults who are health-conscious enough to care about their vitamin and mineral intake but don't mind starting their day off with candy.
