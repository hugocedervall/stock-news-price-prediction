2020-12-07 18:02:00-05:00,HEALTH TECH'S ROLE IN THE NEW OFFICE NORMAL: How digital health firms are helping US employers facilitate return-to-work programs amid the coronavirus pandemic,"Summary List Placement The coronavirus pandemic has thrown the US economy into a state of flux, forcing businesses into uncharted territory as they decide when and how to reopen. Before the pandemic, 39% of US office employees worked remotely—which nearly doubled to 77% during the pandemic, per a June PwC survey. Now, company leaders across the US are strategizing how to resume operations and restore normalcy by bringing their employees back into the office. In order to reopen brick-and-mortar offices, warehouses, and stores, it'll be of paramount importance for employers to navigate how to do so safely and instate routines that curb the spread of the coronavirus. Otherwise, employers risk creating sites of new outbreaks and being forced to shut their doors yet again. The pandemic could hike up employer medical spending—creating an even greater sense of urgency for products that help ensure workers are in good health. The pandemic could increase self-insured employers' medical spending by as much as 10% in 2021, per PwC's estimates .",UNH,en,Business Insider

The 6-year-old startup mainly works with self-funded employers and health plans to help patients figure out their symptoms and the type of medical care they need. It's paid by insurers based on monthly users, and has raised $66.5 million to date. Those without insurance can take a free assessment on Buoy's website, which recommends care options based on their geography and symptoms. Following the surge in virtual care, insurers are focused on which of these vendors can actually reduce costs and improve health outcomes, not just take normal doctors' visits online.

The startup is just the latest in a long line of companies hoping to unseat pharmacy benefits managers, or PBMs. These companies negotiate discounts to prescription drugs at pharmacies like Walgreens on behalf of health insurers and employers and operate largely behind-the-scenes in the eyes of the average patient. But for startups hoping to drive down drug prices, PBMs are almost always the 800-pound gorilla in the room. Three PBMs — CVS Health's Caremark, UnitedHealth Group's OptumRx, and Cigna's Express Scripts — control nearly 75% of the $335 billion market , according to Becker's Hospital Review . WithMe started out by focusing on disrupting the classic PBM business model. Instead of making money off of rebates or dispensing fees, WithMe had planned to get paid a fixed fee for each of its members each month and allow employers to keep tabs on the transactions that get processed to make sure they're not taking any additional money.",UNH,en,Business Insider

But investors are concerned that their success is tied to the coronavirus pandemic. One way to create staying power is acquiring companies that perform a wider array of services. For Amwell, the world's second-largest telehealth company, the strategy isn't off the table, co-CEO Ido Schoenberg said. ""You cannot do everything yourself,"" Schoenberg told Business Insider after Amwell's earnings call on November 12, when asked if he would acquire mental health startups. Schoenberg noted that in the wake of the pandemic, people are more anxious than ever. In June, anxiety and depression symptoms were about three and four times more prevalent among US adults than a year prior, respectively, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found . ""People are in great distress,"" he said. ""And I see behavioral health needs growing in the foreseeable future.""

This volatile environment hasn’t prevented Schwab’s list of actively-managed stock funds from finding daylight, though. Here are three funds in particular that have done well during the virus outbreak. Schwab Health Care Fund™ (SWHFX) COVID-19 has given a boost to the health care sector in 2020, and Schwab’s actively-managed health care fund is no exception to the rule. SWHFX is up 7.2% so far this year. This return is more than 2% higher than the S&P 500 Health Care index over the same period. Like other securities in 2020, SWHFX had a rough journey in March, bottoming out on March 23 at more than 25% in the red for the year. But it bounced back quickly as panic subsided and investors realized that health care stocks might actually benefit from the outbreak. Schwab’s health care fund invests in a wide variety of companies connected to health care—from hospitals to biotech firms to pharmaceutical manufacturers.",UNH,en,Benzinga

US insurer UnitedHealthcare launched a value-based payment program that bundles payments for maternity care costs such as prenatal services, deliveries, and postpartum care into a one-time rate. Historically, providers have been paid on a fee-for-service basis, receiving separate rates for each service provided. The goal is likely to incentivize doctors to provide the best, most efficient care by reimbursing based on value instead of volume. The program is launching with two providers, New Jersey-based Lifeline Medical Associates and Texas-based Privia Medical Group – Gulf Coast; UnitedHealthcare plans to expand the program to 20 providers by 2020.

To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here . US insurer Anthem reported an impressive $24 billion in operating revenue in Q1 2019, up 9% year-over-year (YoY) from $22 billion in 2018, thanks to the addition of over 1 million new members. Anthem's revenue hike comes as the payer gears up to launch a proprietary primary benefit manager (PBM), dubbed IngenioRx . The payer will start transferring members to its PBM at the beginning of May, per Forbes. For context, PBMs are the middlemen of the pharmaceutical industry, responsible for negotiating the costs of drugs for health plans. Here's what it means: Anthem's move into the PBM market could be lucrative — and its sheer size could be a massive aid in kicking off the initiative. The US PBM market is worth around $423 billion , offering Anthem a ripe revenue opportunity. And as the second largest US insurer — Anthem counted nearly 41 million members as of Q1 2019 — Anthem has ample traffic to funnel through IngenioRx, which could help get its fledgling PBM off the ground.",UNH,en,Business Insider

2019-03-08 15:43:14-05:00,Nobody Believes This Market: 2019 Is Now The Worst Year For Stock Outflows Since 2008,"For the past two months, we have been highlighting what emerged as one of the greatest paradoxes of this market in 2019: even as stocks kept grinding higher, having almost wiped out all their Q4 losses as recently as last week, investors were locked in non-stop liquidation mode , selling stocks and pulling money out of equity funds week after week after week, for 12 consecutive weeks since December. We noted most recently this in "" How Are Markets Higher: Buyers' Strike Continues For 11th Straight Week "", "" Buyers' Strike Continues For 12th Straight Week "", "" This Is Strange"": Despite Historic Rally, Investors Continue To Dump Equities "", and even though we identified the ""buyer"" in the form of a persistent short squeeze and another record wave of stock buybacks , the question remained: who would be proven right - the market, which had successfully risen above the critical 2,800 level (if only briefly), or investors whose boycott suggested that few had any trust in the biggest market rally to start the year since 1987.",UNH,en,Zero Hedge
