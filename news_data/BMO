2019-05-15 07:50:00-05:00,Cannabis Global Markets Potential of $194 Billion in Next Seven Years,"PALM BEACH, Florida , May 15, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- The legalization of global cannabis industry seems to grow higher as more and more countries legalize marijuana for recreational and medical use. A report from the bank of Montreal said: "" High valuations justifiable if investors factor in potential of U.S. legalization on a federal level and legalization in the EU. The potential of the global cannabis industry is so vast that it could eventually make the sky-high valuations of some Canadian licensed producers look like bargains, according to a new report from Bank of Montreal . In the report, the bank's cannabis sector analysts, Tamy Chen and Peter Sklar , sought to determine just how big the total addressable market Canadian producers will be competing for in the coming years, one that doesn't stop at Canada's borders. Assuming a blue-sky scenario in which the U.S. and all 28 countries in the EU legalize marijuana for both recreational and medical use — and in which Latin America allows the medical use of cannabis — they project that in seven years the market could reach $194 billion , a number that significantly dwarfs the $5.9 billion in potential revenue they anticipate will be generated by the Canadian medical and recreational markets.",BMO,en,Benzinga
2019-05-13 08:00:00-05:00,Cannabis Legalization Persists as a Topic of Discussion all Over the World,"NEW YORK , May 13, 2019 /PRNewswire/ --The rapid proliferation of cannabis legalization throughout the North American region has led to the emergence of new products within the recreational and medical marketplaces alike. Aside from smoking cannabis through joints or pipes, consumers are now enjoying cannabis in a variety of ways, including edibles and extracts. Consequently, the shift towards different cannabis-based products led to a major decline in flower sales. For instance, Colorado began adult-use sales back in 2014 and flower sales accounted for 67% of the state's total revenue. However, four years later in 2018, flower sales sank and accounted for only 44%. During the same period, the concentrates market closed the gap, as its market share expanded from 15% to 31%, according to BDS Analytics. Now, the declining flower sales don't necessarily mean the cannabis market is retracting, rather, it signifies the emergence of innovation within the industry. On the other hand, segments such as the hemp market have made significant progress over the past year.",BMO,en,Benzinga
