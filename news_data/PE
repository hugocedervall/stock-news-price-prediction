It’s reminiscent of the one in the late 1990s, just as the Internet bubble was exploding. But don’t expect the stocks to rally this time. Parallels between tech in the 1990s and today are common. But there’s been little mention of what the energy sector went through at the same time and how it suddenly looks so familiar. History’s repeating itself as it appears energy can’t attract investors -- again. Then as now, the backdrop to energy’s M&A boom is a collapse in oil prices. The difference this time, however, is the deals are happening at a quarter of the traditional premiums. During this pandemic era, four deals have already emerged: Chevron’s takeover of Noble Energy, ConocoPhillips’s acquisition of Concho Resources, Pioneer Natural Resources’s purchase of Parsley Energy and Devon Energy’s merger with WPX Energy.",PE,en,Zero Hedge

2020-10-07 10:10:00-05:00,Morgan Stanley expects more mega-mergers in the oil industry. Here are the 11 deals the bank says are most likely.,"Summary List Placement Hammered by a collapse in oil prices, the energy industry is entering a new phase focused on returns, which is likely to bring a wave of consolidation, analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note Wednesday. Deals could help US oil companies Exxon and Chevron diversify and build out their clean-energy assets, they said. ""European peers have begun to reposition portfolios away from oil & gas production,"" the analysts said in the note. ""Majors in the US have been slower to adapt despite sharing similar advantages of scale. Focusing on M&A in the power sector, companies with renewable development capabilities could be particularly attractive alternatives to oil & gas."" Today, the energy industry remains fragmented, the analysts said, resulting in a recent spike in deals. Most notably, Chevron acquired Noble Energy in early October through a $5 billion all-stock deal, while shale giants Devon Energy and WPX Energy announced plans to merge in late September.

2020-06-09 09:45:00-05:00,Oil prices are recovering faster than anyone expected. 4 Wall Street banks explain what that means for the energy economy — and share the stocks poised to benefit from the recovery.,"After crashing in March, the price of crude oil is recovering faster than banks initially predicted. Some producers that were forced to pare back oil production are already reversing cuts as a result. Still, don't expect oil demand to fully recover before the end of next year, analysts say. It could take even longer before US production grows. For more stories like this, sign up here for our weekly energy newsletter, Power Line . It was a devastating spring for oil markets, as some futures reached record lows and companies responded by laying off staff, slashing dividends , and cutting billions from annual budgets. But now there's some good news: The price of crude is rising fast — faster than investors expected. The US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate (WTI), posted its sharpest monthly gains on record in May. And when markets opened Tuesday morning, just days after OPEC Plus agreed to extend record supply cuts through July, WTI was trading at about $38 a barrel — up another 8% or so, since the start of June. ""The oversupply, which sent WTI oil prices into the negative earlier this year, is a thing of the past, as long as OPEC+ compliance stays strong and the oil demand recovery trajectory isn't radically altered,"" the research firm Rystad Energy said in a statement on Monday.",PE,en,Business Insider

The result will be a surge in new output which will reverse the benefit from the OPEC+ output cuts, and once again shift the equilibrium in the global oil market to one of oversupply ."" Well, just 24 hours or so later, Goldman's energy analyst Damien Courvalin, who on May 1 turned bullish on oil (after being one of the first in mid-March to correctly warn that negative oil prices are coming) expecting a jump in prices from record lows due to a sharp reversal in supply/demand dynamics in the oil market, has agreed with us, and in a note discussing the latest fundamental drivers in the oil market, says it has turned ""short-term bearish"" on oil, for the following four reasons: i) the unprecedented collapse in oil margins to unprecedented lows (which is reflective of both over-valued crude prices as well as a more moderate demand recovery); ii) demand expectations are running ahead of a more gradual and still highly uncertain recovery; iii) shale and Libyan shut-in production are coming back online, and iv) prices are at levels where OPEC supply cuts should ease and Chinese purchases slow.",PE,en,Zero Hedge

As Bloomberg reported, with China’s demand for crude now once again rising, the Saudis are furiously raising prices in a world where supply has suddenly emerged as the bottleneck. As a result, Aramco raised the price of Arab Light to Asia by $6.10 a barrel to a premium of 20 cents over the benchmark. This monthly increase in the official selling price (OSP) for flagship Arab Light crude to Asia, which accounts for more than half of Saudi oil sales, was the largest since records began in 2000.",PE,en,Zero Hedge

2019-01-07 12:19:28-05:00,US Fracking Wells Are Producing Far Less Than Forecast,"According to a new report by the Wall Street Journal, thousands of shale oil wells that have been drilled over the last five years are pumping less than what was forecast to investors. The new discovery has raised questions about the strength behind the United States' newfound supply of shale oil. The WSJ compares well productivity estimates that were disclosed to investors versus public data of how these wells have performed to date; after analyzing 16,000 wells operated by 29 producers in places like North Dakota and the Permian basin , the Journal found that about 66% of projections made by companies between 2014 and 2017 are reportedly ""overly optimistic"". In total, these companies are set to pump about 10% less oil and gas than was forecast, an amount which equates to about 1 billion barrels of oil and gas over 30 years, which would be priced at about $30 billion at current market prices. In some regions, companies are reportedly off track by more than 50%. As previously discussed, the US shale boom has been one of the main reasons that the US has become an oil superpower over the last couple of years, while trimming the US reliance on foreign oil to virtually nothing.",PE,en,Zero Hedge
