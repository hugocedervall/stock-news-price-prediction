Carrying a business credit card is a great way to separate your personal and work expenses , and can even help raise your personal credit score , and you don't necessarily have to have your own business to qualify for one . The second question is, will you be able to take advantage of this card's benefits versus those of another United credit card ?

2020-09-30 14:20:56.000,Airline Cargo Divisions Finally Gain A Little R-E-S-P-E-C-T,"Air cargo is the cash cow for many passenger airlines during the coronavirus pandemic, an unusual result of decimated travel demand forcing passenger networks to shut down and carriers repurposing airplanes for cargo-only service. Other than cargo and loyalty programs, airline revenues are extremely weak as the industry racks up tens of billions of dollars in losses. Air France-KLM (OTC: AFLYY ), Grupo Aeromexico (OTC: GRPAQ ), IAG Group/British Airways and Korean Air significantly exceeded last year's cargo revenues in the second quarter. Air Canada (OTC: ACDVF ) cargo revenue surpassed passenger revenue for the first time ever. And at United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: UAL ) cargo sales jumped by more than a third and represented more than a quarter of the company's total revenue. Prior to the crisis, cargo revenues represented about 12% of total airline revenues, a share that declined the past decade and is under 5% for mainline U.S. carriers. This year, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates cargo revenue worldwide will reach a near-record and more than double to 26% of the industry's total revenue.",AC,en,Benzinga

The Max was grounded in March 2019 after a pair of fatal crashes — in Indonesia and Ethiopia — that killed 346 people.Even as the company began testing the planes for recertification, a federal inspector general’s report said that Boeing had kept information from federal regulators about the flawed computer system that brought down the two jets during the plane’s initial approval process.The Max is the most recent model of Boeing’s 737, a type of aircraft with many variants over the decades. More than 10,000 737s have been built. The Max was released in 2017 in four lengths to accommodate up to 230 seats. The Max has larger, more fuel-efficient engines than the older models.If the Federal Aviation Administration is convinced that Boeing has corrected the problems that led to the crashes, the planes will return to service, but no timeline has been announced.The agency said in a statement that it “will lift the grounding order only after we are satisfied that the aircraft meets certification standards.”Boeing’s chief executive, David Calhoun, flew on the plane in February.","AAL,AC",en,Economic Times India

2020-05-19 21:09:00.000,"Unlike most airline and hotel rewards, credit card points never expire — and they're often a better deal","Airline miles generally expire 18 to 24 months after you last earned or used rewards in your account, though Delta, JetBlue, Southwest, and United rewards never expire. Hotel points typically expire 12 to 24 months from your last account activity. Some brands have pushed back points expiration dates due to the coronavirus pandemic. Credit card points like American Express Membership Rewards and Chase Ultimate Rewards never expire — and you can transfer these points to various airline and hotel programs. These points also tend to be more valuable than airline miles and hotel points, because you have so many options for using them. To prevent your miles and points from expiring , you can use a credit card associated with your loyalty program, or you can redeem your rewards for travel or even merchandise. See Business Insider's list of the best rewards credit cards. It's easy to earn points and miles by using rewards credit cards and joining hotel and airline loyalty programs, but when it comes time to redeem them, there's often some fine print to parse.","AAPL,AC",en,Business Insider

Despite the existence of a UN agency to oversee global aviation, the International Civil Aviation Organization, each country is given the freedom to decide on issues relating to safety and security.

That recovery timeline was echoed last week by executives at U.S. carriers. Canada's biggest airline reported Monday that first-quarter revenue fell 16% to CA$3.7 billion ($2.6 billion), the first time in 27 consecutive quarters it has not had revenue growth. Airlines began to suspend flights to Asia in January and February, but the full impact of the coronavirus pandemic didn't materialize until March, when social distancing measures and travel bans were implemented worldwide. The destruction in travel demand and resulting ticket cancellations led to a CA$1 billion loss, or $345 million on an adjusted basis. Adjusted earnings per share of minus CA$1.49 was below analysts' consensus for a loss per share of CA$1.22. ""While the duration of the pandemic and its fallout remain unknown, it is our current expectation that it will take at least three years to recover to 2019 levels of revenue and capacity,"" CEO Calin Rovinescu said in a statement. ""We expect that both the overall industry and our airline will be considerably smaller for some time, which will unfortunately result in significant reductions in both fleet and employee levels.",AC,en,Benzinga Feeds

While North American competitors fly the 737 NG – the upgraded version of Boeing's venerable small jetliner that has flown in various versions since the late 1960s – the MAX is the first 737 series to join Air Canada's fleet. That means there are no similar aircraft for the MAX pilots to fly in the interim. The unexpected, incremental cost to cover pilot compensation is just one of many operational, scheduling, logistics, administrative and revenue headaches Air Canada, like it's North American competitors, is coping with in the absence of the MAX, a plane that is central to its growth strategy. Air Canada's fourth quarter net income decreased CA$8 million ($6.1 million) as operating expenses increased 6%, largely due to the no-fly order for the MAX and flying more expensive replacement aircraft.",AC,en,Benzinga Feeds

The Montreal-based airline said the first quarter of 2020 is lining up for earnings, excluding financial considerations, to be CA$200 million lower than in the first quarter of 2019 because of headwinds from the coronavirus, the 737 MAX and a higher proportion of projected annual maintenance expense and employee benefits.
