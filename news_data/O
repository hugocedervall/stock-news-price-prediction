The Kiplinger Dividend 15, the list of our favorite dividend-paying stocks, delivers on the first front, yielding 3.4%, on average, compared with a 1.9% yield for Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and a 1.7% yield for the 10-year Treasury bond. What's more, over the past year, our list has slathered on the gravy, too, returning 13.6%, on average, counting dividends and price appreciation, compared with a 4.3% return for the S&P 500. Big gains don't come without some strings attached. Like many stocks that have ridden this record-long bull market, some of the names on our list appear to be richly valued now. And although dividends buttress returns when a stock's price slides, pricey stocks could take a big hit in the event of a stock market plunge. Perhaps more salient for dividend investors, major boosts in the share price diminish a stock's yield, as is the case with Blackstone Group and Realty Income--two stocks originally chosen for our list because, among other things, they historically provided yields above 4%.",O,en,Kiplinger Washington Editors

2019-08-28 11:30:11-05:00,Buying proven winners has been a market-crushing strategy this year. But one expert says it's gotten too expensive — and has formulated the perfect short bet.,"Sarah McCarthy, a global quant and European equity strategy researcher at Bernstein, advocates for a short position against high-momentum, low-growth stocks. Her thesis is built around stretched valuations, a voracious move lower in interest rates, and overweight hedge fund allocations. Click here for more BI Prime stories . The trend is your friend. This popular axiom has been adhered to for generations, and suggests an investor buy what's going up while selling what's declining. Don't try to be a hero, just ride the wave. The momentum approach — formally defined as buying stocks that have performed well over the previous three to 12 months, then selling those that have lagged over the same time period — has outperformed all other styles in the US in 2019, and on a long-short basis is up 11%. It's been an undeniable success. But Sarah McCarthy, a global quant and European equity strategy researcher at Bernstein , is starting to see cracks developing in the landscape — and she thinks it's setting up a perfect short. ""We are changing our view on Momentum, and specifically stocks which are high Momentum but not high Growth,"" she wrote in a client note. ""These stocks have benefitted from the continuation of the trend of falling bond yields (as Growth stocks have), but this recent acceleration of outperformance seems excessive and overly dependent on a continuation of the current macro path."" She continued: ""As a result, we recommend going short the companies that are high Momentum but are not high Growth.""

2019-07-30 12:41:49-05:00,The real reason why Indira nationalised banks,"The 50th anniversary of the nationalisation of big banks by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi has attracted limited comment. Some critics call it a terrible economic blunder, since public sector banks (PSBs) have become a byword for enormous losses, inefficiency and loans based on phone calls from political masters. Top PSB appointments have sometimes been made to shady bankers, who guaranteed kickbacks to their appointers.Defenders of bank nationalisation say it had positive outcomes, like spreading banking to rural areas, aiding the Green Revolution and reducing poverty. It also ended the hold of a few industrialists over bank finance, replacing it with ‘priority sector’ lending by PSBs that directed loans to socially important sectors. This last point was hotly contested by Gandhi’s key opponent Morarji Desai, who said that social aims could equally be achieved by directives to PSBs.
