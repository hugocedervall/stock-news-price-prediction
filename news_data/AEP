President Trump famously failed to deliver on his promise to end the war on coal. He may have rolled back environmental regulations on the sector, but he could not negate the competitive pressures on the US coal industry from low cost renewables and gas. Coal company bankruptcies continued under the Trump administration and the US famously shuttered more coal power capacity under Trump's first term than it did under Obama's second term. But Trump did attempt to throw a lifeline to the embattled sector. President-elect Joe Biden has made no such promises and instead talks openly of multi-trillion dollar clean energy investment and a transition away from fossil fuels.",AEP,en,BusinessGreen

However, Putin stressed that any efforts to decarbonise the world's fourth largest greenhouse gas emitter must be balanced with strong economic development, and Russia's new 2030 climate targets unveiled this week include room for increases in gas production and remain heavily reliant on carbon offsetting and sinks. The decree formally orders the Russian government to work towards a cut in emissions of up to 70 per cent against 1990 levels by 2030, according to Reuters . However environmentalists have noted that the new 2030 target takes into account the maximum ability of Russia's forests to sequester carbon, and that the actual emissions reductions being targeted are therefore closer to 30 per cent by 2030 and would require little additional effort to meet, Russian newspaper Kommersant reports .",AEP,en,BusinessGreen

Last year the U.S. consumed 11.3 quadrillion British thermal units of coal, the lowest level since 1964. By comparison, total consumption of renewable energy hit a record-high 11.5 quadrillion Btu, the EIA said Thursday, as the country’s base of wind and solar farms continued to expand. Prior to 2019, the last year that the country got more total energy from renewables than coal was 1885, when wood was the main renewable resource on offer. Earlier this month the EIA put out figures projecting that renewables will topple coal in the U.S. electricity mix throughout 2020, another major milestone.
