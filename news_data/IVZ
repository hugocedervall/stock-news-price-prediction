2020-10-14 03:21:53-05:00,Wave of consolidation in asset management expected to increase pressure on ‘squeezed’ mid-size firms,"Wave of consolidation in asset management expected to increase pressure on ‘squeezed’ mid-size firms Submitted By Madeleine Taylor | 14/10/2020 - 9:21am A new wave of consolidation has started sweeping the asset management industry, and is expected to accelerate as sharper fee compression and rising costs turn up the pressure on investment firms. This month, US investment bank Morgan Stanley revealed plans to buy investment manager Eaton Vance, in a move that will almost double its assets under management to USD1.2 trillion. “Eaton Vance is a perfect fit for Morgan Stanley,” said James P Gorman, chairman and chief executive officer of Morgan Stanley, at the time of the announcement. Gorman explained that Morgan Stanley sees it as an opportunity to add more fee-based revenues and boost assets under management. Bing Waldert, managing director of US research at asset management research firm Cerulli Associates, says investment managers are looking to gain greater market share as their profits come under increasing threat. “The overarching theme is continued compression of fees in the asset management marketplace,” says Waldert. “At a top line, that means the revenue that an asset manager is able to raise, but as you start to dig deeper, it's also about costs in a stricter regulatory environment.” Allocators are “looking to engage with fewer partners on a deeper level”, which means their expectations for asset manager relationships are going up, and the fees they expect to pay are going down.",IVZ,en,InstitutionAlassetManager

2020-10-13 15:09:00-05:00,10 Nasdaq-100 ETFs and Mutual Funds to Buy,"Forget the S&P 500 and even the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The big name in big-name indices – at least in the past few years – is the Nasdaq-100. The Nasdaq-100 Index, which began in 1985, is a select slice of the larger Nasdaq Composite's 100 largest nonfinancial companies. Historically (and currently), it has been dominated by technology stocks, which currently account for roughly half the fund's assets, and it also holds healthy slugs of high-growth communications and consumer plays. This tech-heavy index has been a monster outperformer for years. The Nasdaq-100 Index has run up about 445% since the start of 2011, lapping the S&P 500 (180%) and the Dow (148%), and even widely beating the broader Nasdaq Composite (348%). That has been a boon for Invesco ( IVZ ), whose Invesco QQQ Trust ( QQQ ) has allowed investors to take advantage of those rapid gains for decades. Assets in the QQQ ETF have exploded, and the company hopes to further leverage the QQQ's success via some newly announced investment products tied to the fund (more on those in a moment). ""When it launched 20 years ago, the Invesco QQQ ETF was a pioneer in simplifying how investors gained access to companies within the NASDAQ-100 Index,"" says John Hoffman, Head of Americas, ETF & Indexed Strategies at Invesco.

(MS),"Summary List Placement This story was first published in February 2020, and was updated on October 9, 2020 to reflect Morgan Stanley's Eaton Vance acquisition. Morgan Stanley's move to buy $7 billion investment manager Eaton Vance is the latest example of intense consolidation in the active management industry, a space that's fallen under pressure in recent years amid changing investor preferences — and commanded the need for size to survive. The tie-up came months after asset management giant Franklin Resources closed on its $4.5 billion Legg Mason deal , and a week after the Wall Street Journal reported activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management had taken sizeable stakes in asset managers Invesco and Janus Henderson as part of a plan to agitate for a combination.

But while prices are getting close to record highs, miners of the precious metal are still far away from their 2011 highs, which means there could be room for a catch-up rally in the sector. Gold miners have outperformed during this year’s market rout, and have continued to climb during the recovery. Meanwhile, escalating tensions between the U.S. and China are adding to the case for the haven. ""Both fundamentals and positioning look aligned for gold miners to shoot higher,” Societe Generale SA strategists led by Sophie Huynh say, adding that gold and gold miners “ have a very temporary strong relationship whenever powerful market shifts are underway .” The strategists note that unlike bullion, the miners are still far from 2011 levels, but with anticipation of a new mini-cycle, the stocks could offer a way to boost portfolios as “embedded call options” on the metal, while providing a hedge against inflation. “The environment is still looking very good for gold and gold miners ,” Amundi Asset Management fund manager Arnaud du Plessis wrote earlier this month, arguing that central banks are staying on full alert as the resurgence of Covid-19 in some parts of the world is creating fears of a second wave.",IVZ,en,Zero Hedge

The volume highlights the depth of the coronavirus-led market shift towards ‘safe haven’ assets and the central role that ETPs have played in supporting investors at this key time, Invesco says. Demand for gold via ETPs increased by over 300 per cent year-on-year when comparing Q1 2019 with Q1 2020, the survey says. While 341 tonnes of gold were purchased by ETPs in Q1 2016, the high price of gold in the first quarter of this year meant the overall value was the highest on record. In terms of performance, the spot gold price returned 3.9 per cent in USD for Q1 this year, second only to US Treasuries among the major asset classes. Of those considered in the report, gold was the best-performing asset for the 12 months to the end of March 2020, with a return of 22.0 per cent in USD.",IVZ,en,ETF Express

The IA observes that during the early weeks of the crisis in Europe, concerns were raised about ETFs trading in the secondary markets at a significant discount or premium to their net asset value (NAV), particularly in the context of fixed income ETFs, and in particular investment-grade corporate bond ETFs, where 80 per cent saw discounts climb to all-time highs. “Questions were also raised as to whether this represented a breakdown of the ‘arbitrage mechanism’ by which premiums or discounts to NAV within ETF pricing are usually corrected, and that the discounts were having a distortive effect on the prices of underlying bonds,” the IA says.",IVZ,en,ETF Express

The firm raised around USD11 billion in net new assets, pushing it up the rankings in Europe to number three. “We are very happy with that,” Mellor says. “We punch significantly above our weight with a growing market share.” The growth has come from a combination of factors, he says. Firstly, equity products, particularly the US equity suite had a very good year but, Mellor says, other areas were also firing well, such as gold and fixed income.

But there is a caveat, says Kalivas. “While the strategy tends to generate excess returns when the stock market is performing poorly or there is great deal of risk in marketplace, it is still important to view low volatility for the long term. If you’re expecting it to be a cash or bond substitute, the greater the chance you will have of disappointment. Kalivas has found that in recent weeks, performance is in line with what they have seen historically. However, the down capture has been at the higher end of the range. As a long equity strategy, low volatility tends to have varying performance in different market conditions, explains Kalivas. When investors are looking to have exposure to low volatility stocks, they are trying to harvest the low volatility anomaly over a longer time horizon.",IVZ,en,etfexpress.com

This means that both local economies and the global economy have been affected in a growing number of sectors, including restaurants, entertainment, transport, and mobile phone mobility data. Global investment management firm Invesco, says that a three-pronged policy response is necessary to limit the spread of coronavirus as well as its economic impact: public health policy to help contain the virus, monetary policy in order to promote financial liquidity and functionality, and fiscal policies that can help contain economic damage. “China’s measures — locking down parts of the country — have been described as draconian, but they were effective: China’s new infections have dwindled.",IVZ,en,privateequitywire.co.uk

Experts across Wall Street say the fight is spreading around the world.,"The Trump administration's global trade war is spreading to more countries instead of wrapping up, according to Katie Nixon, chief investment officer of Northern Trust Wealth Management. Even though Wall Street is growing increasingly optimistic — especially after Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to trade-war ceasefire over the weekend — the US president has recently ramped up his rhetoric against Vietnam, Japan, Mexico and India. Nixon says that the widening dispute means businesses are facing even more uncertainty, and as that continues, it will have more of an effect on their spending and growth. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . Just as the world starts hoping the trade war between the US and China is calming down, it might actually be spreading. The world's two biggest economic powers may have announced a ceasefire in the dispute over the weekend, but some experts argue the Trump administration's trade-policy conflicts involve more countries than ever. ""Trump has been saber rattling with Europe over trade, (and) Japan, India,"" Katie Nixon, chief investment officer of Northern Trust Wealth Management, told Business Insider in an interview. ""Trade is going to continue to be sort of this whack a mole game."" She continued: ""I wish we could move past it, but I don't think we will.""

Venezuela’s 2022 bonds on Thursday halted their biggest three-day rally since October, but the rally so far has been nothing short of stunning, though many LatAm investors have opted to steer clear for now.

He added that Maduro - who has kicked out all US diplomats and insisted that he will retaliate against demonstrators - will do ""whatever it takes to be in power."" While Maduro is still technically in control of the levers of power and the country's collapsing energy infrastructure, Guaido has one key advantage: The US could unfreeze millions of dollars in Venezuelan assets and turn them over to him.",IVZ,en,Zero Hedge
