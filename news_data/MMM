Early on during the outbreak of the coronavirus, securing PPE for medical professionals (and for the nation) was one of the key problems. Recall, even Dr. Fauci was telling the nation not to go out and wear masks because the medical community needed them so desperately. Supply has improved since the beginning of the pandemic but some healthcare facilities are still below recommended quantities , according to the Wall Street Journal . This has forced some facilities to ration and reuse masks. In Michigan, almost 66% of healthcare systems are reporting less than a 3 week supply of PPE. Some facilities say they have less than a 7 day supply. The state recommends a 3 month supply. Each state's efforts to rebuild their supply of masks has been slowed by the rising number of cases, as the nation heads into the critical winter season.",MMM,en,Zero Hedge

These strategies may be controversial, but they also seem to work; Netflix, founded in 1997, has reached a $227 billion market cap since going public in 2002. On a recent episode of the podcast Starting Up , Hastings told Insider's Global Editor-in-Chief Nich Carlson about his new book "" No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention ,"" which he co-wrote with author Erin Meyer. The book dives into the policies that made the company unique. For example, Netflix's ""Keeper Test"" urges managers to frequently evaluate whether they should fire or keep employees. ""If you're going to be the coach of the team that wins the Olympics, you better have incredible players at every position or you're not going to win the gold medal,"" Hastings told Carlson. ""We're trying to win the championship of film and television…and to do that we have to have an Olympic caliber team.""

In a recent study conducted by Red Points , the online brand-protection company that I lead, we found 60.4% of consumers said they have increased online shopping versus shopping in-store, and 60% of Americans are purchasing more household cleaning products online. This makes consumers vulnerable to the rising number of counterfeit goods online. The number of counterfeit goods on the internet has grown exponentially since the advent of e-commerce and social media, flying quietly under consumers’ radar. Now, counterfeiters’ “attack surfaces” have expanded beyond e-commerce marketplaces to social media channels such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. Even the most tech-savvy consumers are sometimes tricked by these advertisements, which can often result in lost revenue for retailers and a hit to their image. The size of this problem is staggering. Even before the coronavirus was unleashed on the world, it was estimated that by 2022, counterfeiting will be a $4.2 trillion industry , and global damage from counterfeit goods will exceed $323 billion.",MMM,en,Fast Company
