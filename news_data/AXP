To help curb the spread of the virus, a number of EU countries are implementing measures such as curfews, restrictions on social gatherings, and limited nonessential business hours. However, if the situation worsens, governments may need to enforce stricter measures—like Ireland, which just entered a six-week lockdown —which may have detrimental effects on European issuers like UK-based Barclays, which saw a 4.7% year-over-year (YoY) drop in UK consumer card spending in Q1 2020. The US coronavirus outlook may mirror that of Europe, which would negatively impact spending. US coronavirus restrictions and recovery have varied from state to state, and many regions have lagged behind Europe in the spread of cases.

Employees then use the custom Lola experience to book work-related trips. The Boston-based company is competing in an increasingly crowded space, but Volpe thinks Lola has another edge over rivals: its deal with American Express Global Business Travel, one of the largest players in the corporate travel market. American Express is using Lola to target medium-sized companies; its sales team markets Lola to those kinds of customers.

Cohen broke with convention again by investing the vast majority of his wealth in two stocks , Apple and Wells Fargo, and later placing a contrarian bet on ailing video-game retailer GameStop.

For example, many people initially doubted Chewy would be able to ship 30-pound bags of pet food to customers and make any money.

2020-09-29 09:00:00-05:00,Dining sales recovery offers hope for credit card issuers,"Summary List Placement Coronavirus-mandated stay-at-home measures and dining closures led to significant losses for US restaurants, but recent figures from NPD Group indicate that those declines are slowing. Restaurant revenues only fell 9% annually in August, an improvement from the average 78% sales decline reported in the first week of April at the pandemic's height. Following the peak, on-premise restaurant visits improved monthly leading into the summer as coronavirus cases decreased and restrictions lifted. And with New York City making outdoor dining permanent year-round, other major US cities may follow suit, which could continue to increase the overall financial outlook for restaurants. An improvement in dining sales could give a much-needed boost to credit card issuers—if they can incentivize spending. The travel and entertainment (T&E) category—which includes dining—took a substantial hit as consumers temporarily ceased dining out during the pandemic. For example, Amex's global consumer billed business declined 20% year-over-year (YoY) in Q2, mostly led by its T&E category, which fell almost 100% YoY in April.",AXP,en,Business Insider

This year, however, I made it my goal to put some of my hard-earned money in the bank for the long term. I also wanted to make sure it would grow, since typical savings accounts only earn about 0.01%.

From in-store layaway to store-branded credit cards, retailers have always used financing as a way to convert browsers to buyers. But over the last several years, a cohort of fintechs have cropped up offering a new way for retailers to boost sales: buy now, pay later. From no-interest, two-week installment plans to longer-term financing, fintechs like Affirm, Afterpay, and Klarna, to name a few, have won over millions of consumers and tens of thousands of retailers with their digital-forward, easy-to-use alternatives to credit cards. It's no secret that e-commerce is on the rise with continued growth year-over-year for the last decade. And like other digitally-driven trends, the coronavirus pandemic has only accelerated growth in the e-commerce segment. In 2019, e-commerce accounted for 11% of total retail sales in the US. In 2020, total retail sales have been down, but in the second quarter this year, with brick-and-mortar retail largely shut down, e-commerce grew to 16% of total retail sales, reflecting a 44% increase quarter-over-quarter, according to the US Census Bureau .",AXP,en,Business Insider
2020-09-14 11:18:24-05:00,Delta spins off its cash-cow frequent flyer program to serve as collateral for a $6.5 billion loan amidst the airline industry bloodbath (DAL),"Summary List Placement Delta Air Lines will become the latest airline to raise cash by using the billions it earns from its frequent flyer program as collateral. The airline said on Monday that it would raise $6.5 billion in loans backed by its SkyMiles program in a private notes offering. Airlines have raised cash through the pandemic largely by offering physical assets like aircraft as collateral, as well as airline business assets such as slots, routes, and airport gates. For US airlines, however, frequent flyer programs, with valuations in the tens of billions of dollars , offer another lifeline. While airlines frame their frequent flyer programs — fairly, in many cases — as being valuable for passengers, the rewards programs earn significantly more for airlines than they cost them. Airlines make billions per year by selling frequent-flyer miles to their credit-card partners. In turn, the credit card companies issue them to cardholders as spending rewards. For example, American Express, which issues co-branded credit cards with Delta, purchases the airline's miles and issues them to customers as a reward for spending, typically at a rate of 1-2 miles per dollar spent on the relevant credit card.",AXP,en,Business Insider

2020-05-08 13:13:00-05:00,Credit card relief can be a valuable option if you're facing financial hardship — and it won't harm your credit score as long as you and your lender are on the same page,"If you're unable to pay your bills, one option is to look into your bank's credit card forbearance program. Credit card forbearance is an agreement you make with your lender. It essentially lets you pause or lower your account payments for a specified amount of time. If you enter into credit card forbearance, your credit score won't suffer so long as you've worked out an agreement with your lender. If you simply stop paying your bills without talking to your bank, it may report your payments as late or missed, which would harm your credit. A credit card with an introductory APR offer could be a good alternative to credit card forbearance, but note that it could be difficult to get approved for a card if you've lost your source of income and your credit score isn't extremely high.

Pausing my utility payments was no problem, and my mortgage, credit card, and car loan companies all offered to pause my payments. Interest would continue to accrue, but eventually negative credit markers and late fees would be removed from my accounts. However, six weeks later, my car company placed a courtesy call to check in on why my bill hadn't been paid — their automated system can't account for all of the anomalies cropping up in the wake of the coronavirus. I'm relying on the social safety net to buy groceries and continue paying my mortgage. I'm still figuring out the rest. Read more personal finance coverage .

It's harder to justify paying high annual fees for premium credit cards like the Chase Sapphire Reserve® when you can't take advantage of the travel benefits. Chase has taken a good first step by issuing $100 statement credits toward the Chase Sapphire Reserve® annual fee, but I think card issuers should do more. Beyond reducing annual fees, banks should add more non-travel options for using your points and miles. One early example is using Capital One miles for streaming services and food delivery . Airlines should also make customer-friendly changes to their programs, including eliminating change fees and fuel surcharges. See Business Insider's list of the best travel rewards credit cards.

My pick was the Citi® Double Cash Card , which earns 2% cash back on every purchase (1% back when you buy, and another 1% back when you pay your bill). I'll still use my Chase Sapphire Reserve® and American Express® Gold Card to earn bonus rewards on food delivery, but the Citi® Double Cash Card card is now my go-to for purchases that wouldn't earn me bonus points with another card.

The World Health Organization was cited recommending consumers opt for contactless payments but has since clarified that they have not issued an official warning against the use of cash , recommending consumers wash their hands after handling any physical currency. Card issuers are slowly circulating contactless-enabled cards into the US market and many merchants already have the necessary hardware. But consumers have so far been slow to start tapping to pay.

And considering the most popular factor that affects Chinese tourists' overseas shopping habits is the payment method (37%), which just beats out product quality (36%) and price (36%), payments companies' operations may matter as much as which merchants they work with. Forty-four percent of Chinese tourists in some popular travel destinations like the UK, Singapore, and South Korea use mobile payments most often while just 13% of their general tourist populations do the same, suggesting that accepting mobile payments internationally can help payments companies attract Chinese tourists' payment volume.",AXP,en,Business Insider
2020-01-27 13:16:00-05:00,"More than half of people with rewards cards miss out on points or cash back, and it's a mistake that can add up quickly","According to a survey from Bankrate, 55% of rewards card holders who pay their bills in full each month are missing out on rewards by choosing debit or cash. The survey found that rewards cardholders were most likely to leave points or cash back on the table by paying for groceries and restaurant purchases with cash or debit. Many credit cards offer bonus rewards for groceries and dining purchases. For example, the Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express earns 6% back at US supermarkets on up to $6,000 in purchases each year (then 1% back). And the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card earns 2 points per dollar on all your dining spending. Coupled with a credit card sign-up bonus, the rewards from your everyday spending can help you book travel like award flights or hotel stays . See Business Insider's list of the best rewards credit cards » The cardinal rule of using credit cards responsibly is to treat them like debit cards, only spending what you can afford to pay off each month. Provided you're not spending beyond your means, credit cards can be powerful tools for building credit , protecting against fraud , and earning rewards — but a recent survey from Bankrate found that far too many cardholders are leaving value on the table.",AXP,en,Business Insider

When you have over two dozen credit cards like I do, it's crucial to periodically go through the collection and make sure that each card is worth keeping — especially for cards that charge an annual fee . Every year, I close at least one or two credit cards (and open several others). However, there are some cards that I've decided are worth keeping for the long term, even if they have an annual fee. Those five are the: Chase Sapphire Reserve The United Explorer Card The World Of Hyatt Credit Card The Blue Business® Plus Credit Card from American Express Citi® Double Cash Card Here's why I'll be holding onto these cards for the long term: Chase Sapphire Reserve Even though the Chase Sapphire Reserve has a $450 annual fee, it's easy to get at least that much value from the card's benefits.",AXP,en,Business Insider

Lola focuses on making it easier for medium-sized companies to manage corporate travel arrangements. Companies use the service to authorize employees to make travel-related purchases and set their own policies for those purchases. Employees then use the custom Lola experience to book work-related trips. The Boston-based company is competing in an increasingly crowded space, but Volpe thinks Lola has another edge over rivals: its deal with American Express Global Business Travel, one of the largest players in the corporate travel market. American Express is using Lola to target medium-sized companies; its sales team markets Lola to those kinds of customers. And through that relationship, Lola gets access to special deals on airfare and hotels that are only available to American Express that it can offer its customers.

The Platinum Card from American Express has a high annual fee, but you can get enough value for it to be worthwhile. Over the past two years, Amex has added new benefits and perks to both the personal and business versions of the card, and made a few tweaks as the credit card rewards space has become more competitive. While the personal and business versions used to have virtually identical benefits and terms (with a few exceptions), they're no longer nearly identical — while they do have many overlapping benefits, there are some key differences.

With the CardMatch tool , you may be able to find bigger bonuses than you would at the card issuer's website. For example, the Platinum Card® from American Express is available to some users with a welcome bonus of 100,000 points after $5,000 spent in the first three months (compared to the standard offer of 60,000 points). CardMatch offers can change at any time without notice, but now is a great time to check if you're eligible for the Amex Platinum offer, as reports indicate it's still available. If you're worried about meeting minimum purchase requirements, consider pre-buying things you'll need in the future anyway like cleaning supplies and other household goods.

Not only do most of the major airlines have their own portals, but some hotel programs do as well. Credit card issuers like Chase and Barclays also have their own shopping portals, but you need a credit card to utilize them. While you don't have to pay with plastic to utilize online shopping portals, you can ""double up"" on rewards if you do. For example, use the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card to make a purchase through the Ultimate Rewards portal and earn extra points. It's not hard to see why travel rewards have been growing in popularity over the last decade. You can use airline miles to pay for first-class flights that cost thousands of dollars , and you can use hotel points or credit card rewards to book hotels and even vacation rentals , along with rental cars, daily excursions and activities, and more. The quickest way to earn points and miles is to sign up for a travel rewards credit card to earn a sign-up bonus and get rewarded for your spending.",AXP,en,Business Insider

Here's how I'm deciding which cards to keep","I have 14 credit cards, and their annual fees total more than $2,500. I'm planning to get rid of the cards I don't fully utilize. It's easy to justify some of those fees, like on the Chase Sapphire Reserve and the Platinum Card® from American Express thanks to their amazing perks and annual statement credits. But I don't travel with certain airlines and hotels enough to continue paying the high fees for some other cards. Take a hard look at whether you're fully utilizing the benefits of each credit card to decide whether it's worth continuing to pay. And if you do decide to get rid of a card, consider the impact it will have on your credit score. It's all relative, especially in the world of points, miles, and award travel. I have 14 credit cards — a jaw-dropping number in the eyes of most of my friends and family, but a modest lineup compared to plenty of others who put time and effort into maximizing every dollar they spend to fuel their adventures around the globe.

The study also found that these costs were as much as 9.5 times what Medicare would cover. Many air ambulance companies don't participate in medical insurance programs, so you could be on the hook for a huge bill unless you plan ahead. Luckily, credit cards like the Chase Sapphire Reserve and the Platinum® Card from American Express offer emergency evacuation insurance, covering you up to $100,000 for medical transportation. You just need to pay for your trip with a card that offers this coverage. It's the kind of benefit you hopefully never need to use, but in the face of a medical emergency, credit card evacuation insurance can mean the difference between a $40,000 bill and being off the hook for huge transportation expenses.

These directives were applicable not only to payment entities but also to all banks operating in India, it further added.In April 2018, the RBI had issued a note mandating that all payments firms should store data within India.

However, the data shall be stored only in India after the processing,” RBI said in a note released on Wednesday.The central bank had given a 24-hour timeframe within which the data needs to be brought back to India after processing is completed outside the country.In cases of charge back or any other reconciliation processes that might need to be undertaken, it can be done by accessing the data from servers in India. “In such a case, the data needs to be deleted from the systems abroad and brought to India not later than one business day or 24 hours from payment processing, whichever is earlier.",AXP,en,The Economic Times India

The Chase Freedom card, for instance, offers 5% back on rotating quarterly categories once you activate — and one of those categories is big-box stores like Costco. When you need a really good deal on everyday grocery items like bulk frozen food, a massive bag of baby spinach, and almond milk, or larger purchases like car tires, a 600-bottle wine cellar, and funeral caskets, Costco is the place to go. You can even fill up your gas tank on the way out at prices ten to twenty cents lower per gallon than nearby stations, or take a $1.50 jumbo hot-dog and soda combo to go.

There are many reasons it makes sense to use a credit card when paying for your family's needs.

If you're planning to open a travel credit card to help you earn enough points and miles to travel at a steep discount — or even free — there are countless credit cards to choose from. The most valuable travel credit cards earn transferable points, so you can move the points around to different airlines and hotel chains as you need them. You'll also want to look at the annual fee (is it outweighed by the benefits?) and the sign-up bonus, as well as its policy for authorized users and its annual and travel benefits. Some of the most flexible travel cards available are the Platinum Card® from American Express , the Chase Sapphire Reserve , and the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card. It's important to comparison shop when looking for a new travel rewards credit card. Each card offers a different set of benefits, has different rewards programs, and oftentimes a different set of associated fees.",AXP,en,Business Insider

This perk more than outweighs the card's annual fee, which is why I'm keeping the card indefinitely.

Until July 2, the card is offering double its usual new member bonus: You can get 75,000 SkyMiles, and 5,000 MQMs, when you spend $3,000 in the first three months.

With a newly increased sign-up bonus of 60,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points — the highest ever — generous rewards, and a low annual fee, the card offers significant on-going value. The increased bonus gives the Preferred an edge over the popular Chase Sapphire Reserve , at least for the first year.

The Chase Sapphire Preferred is one of the all-around best rewards credit cards available, when taking everything into account — annual fee, sign-up bonus, rewards earning, ways to redeem rewards, travel perks and protections, and more.

I had become a capitalist, and it felt good.""Since taking control of Berkshire Hathaway in 1965, Buffett has marshalled the company to an annual average gain of 20.5 percent, more than double the average advance of the S&P 500.Berkshire's market value is now around $530 billion.The success comes not only from Buffett's investments in other publicly-traded companies but also from an assortment of holdings of profitable companies in a range of sectors, including insurance, freight rail transportation and electric utilities.But Buffett is an enterprising stock picker and his quarterly list of holdings is closely watched by other investors.""Most portfolio managers would be considered successful when they are right 70% of the time.","BAC,AXP",en,The Economic Times India

But Berkshire also has stakes in life and health insurance coverage as well as reinsurance.The multi-billionaire describes this business line as Berkshire Hathaway's growth engine, allowing the company to invest policyholder premiums and pay out claims as needed.The BNSF Railway Company includes nearly 400 companies acquired over 160 years.","BAC,AXP",en,The Economic Times India

Cash-back cards are the most popular rewards credit cards, according to a recent study. While it's possible to get more value from travel rewards cards , cash back is simpler, more flexible, and often easier. Like most rewards credit cards , cash-back cards work by giving you a portion of the processing fee that the issuer gets from the merchant for each transaction. While some cards offer a consistent 1.5–2% cash-back rate on purchases, you may be better off with a card that offers higher amounts back in bonus categories, or large new membership bonuses. Similarly, you might actually earn more from a card with an annual fee than a no-annual-fee option. These are the best cash back credit cards currently available, from Chase, Citi, Wells Fargo, Capital One, and American Express. When you're looking to earn credit card rewards, the type of rewards you go for, beyond just the specific card you open, can make a big difference in how much value you get.",AXP,en,Business Insider

2019-02-25 15:53:15-05:00,What Is Really Going On Behind The Scenes: The Donaldtov-Xibbentrop Pact,"Submitted by Michael Every of Rabobank “I am pleased to report that the U.S. has made substantial progress in our trade talks with China on important structural issues including intellectual property protection, technology transfer, agriculture, services, currency, and many other issues. As a result of these very productive talks, I will be delaying the U.S. increase in tariffs now scheduled for March 1. Assuming both sides make additional progress, we will be planning a Summit for President Xi and myself, at Mar-a-Lago, to conclude an agreement. A very good weekend for U.S. & China!” With those words from US President Trump, is the trade war over? Nothing is signed yet; US tariffs aren’t coming down, just not going up; we don’t have any details; and any real deal will be impossible for China to stick to . Apart from that, everything is fine! We’ve also previously pointed out USD1.2 trillion of new Chinese imports from the US is gibberish that will mean substituting others’ goods in defiance of WTO agreement, and that the currency stability pledge is also bogus.",AXP,en,Zero Hedge
2019-02-15 07:52:40-05:00,"After Saying iPhone ""Enormously Underpriced"", Buffett Trims Apple Stake","Berkshire Hathaway's latest 13-F filing shows Warren Buffett was unusually active during Q4 as the billionaire investor rushed to take advantage of the volatility in markets to buy into banks and insurers that he has long had his eye on, in keeping with Buffett's famous maxim: ""Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful."" Buffett continued to bid up bank shares, making his Omaha-based firm a major shareholder in four of the five largest US banks. This includes increasing stakes in JP Morgan and Bank of America during the last three months of the year. Buffett also boosted his stakes in regional lenders like PNC Financial Services Group and US Bancorp which may have been plays on consolidation in the industry (a trend that is starting to play out following the recent BB&T-Suntrust deal ). And while bank stocks have rallied during the opening weeks of the year during one of the biggest market rebounds in recent memory, Buffett unexpectedly cut his stake in Apple.","BAC,AXP",en,Zero Hedge
