Here's how they work and where to order one.,"Summary List Placement Among the hundreds of tests out there for the novel coronavirus, just a handful have received emergency authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration to ship them to people's homes. With at-home tests, people self-collect their samples and send them back to the testing company for analysis. Several companies are developing tests that can work fully at home without shipping and lab equipment involved, but they haven't received the FDA's go-ahead yet. Still, ordering a test from the comfort of home can be appealing. It not only avoids run-ins with the physical healthcare system, saving time, but also reduces the risk of spreading the virus or getting infected yourself.

Impossible announced last week that consumers can buy its plant-based ground protein directly from the company website. ""It was one of the things on the list,"" said Jessica Appelgren, vice president of communications at Impossible Foods. ""But COVID made it go to the top of the list."" Impossible joins a handful of other plant-based food companies that drastically have shifted their business strategies due to the pandemic. Exponential Foods , a plant-based meat company focusing on Mexican-style meats, was set to launch in US grocery stores when the pandemic hit. Suddenly its retail partners were more focused on staying afloat and adjusting to new social distancing regulations than launching a new product. ""We had direct-to-consumer in mind,"" Exponential Foods CEO Iván Jiménez said. ""But our idea was to wait a little bit because of the complexity in taxes, and we wanted to avoid that for a while.""

In 2017, the Minneapolis-based company had set a goal to gradually increase hourly wages from $10 to $15 by the end of 2020. The last time Target permanently increased pay was in June 2019 when it raised hourly pay to $13. But starting in mid-March, Target gave a temporary $2 wage bump to part-time and full-time workers as a reward for working under the crush of orders from stay-at-home shoppers. The pay hike affects roughly 275,000 Target workers, the retailer said. With these changes, Target said it will have invested nearly $1 billion more this year in its workers than it did last year. That also includes a $200 bonus to its workers payable at the end of July that it also announced Wednesday. This is on top of bonuses of $250 to $1,500 paid out in April to 20,000 hourly store team leaders who oversee individual departments in Target stores.",KR,en,Connecticut Post

But Tom Szaky, CEO of TerraCycle, thinks when the crisis is over there will be even more opportunity for reusable packaging and containers to become more commonplace, if done right. ""Recycling is going to take a real punch to the face, to be quite fair,"" Szaky said during GreenBiz Group’s Circularity 20 Digital event this week, pointing to the continued decrease in oil prices and the pressure that's putting on the economics of using recycled plastics. ""That’s disastrous for the recycling industry, which creates its revenue by selling recycled plastics, which are hedged against, in many ways, the price of oil."" Many recycling activities have been paused as the pandemic has raised health and safety concerns, which could lead to a waste crisis post-pandemic, he said. Recycling centers have closed temporarily or indefinitely, across California and in parts of Ohio, Oregon and Alabama. ""That, I think, will benefit waste innovations,"" said Szaky, whose company is in the business of recycling and eliminating waste. ""It will especially benefit the reuse movement because that is sort of the next step up in waste innovation."" Szaky acknowledged that reuse is not a silver bullet solution to addressing the waste problem, but if life cycle assessment is considered , he said that reuse can be better than single-use options in a significant number of cases.",KR,en,GreenBiz

Tyson, the largest US meat producer, said second-quarter profits fell 14.5% from last year as the coronavirus pandemic upsets supply chains and disrupts processing plants across the country. Total sales for the three-month period ended March 28 rose nearly $500 million, but the company warned volumes are likely to fall in the second half of the year as upticks in grocery store sales aren't enough to offset the drop-off in restaurant demand. ""We have and expect to continue to face slowdowns and temporary idling of production facilities from team member shortages or choices we make to ensure operational safety,"" the company said in a press release.

Grocery lots are a focal point, but other types of parking spaces are also getting a rethink as the coronavirus pandemic prompts companies and cities alike to implement measures that limit the number of people who mix in enclosed spaces. The idea of a grocery store as a terminal — instead of a consumer shopping center — is likely to gain traction as a result of the pandemic, said Anne Goodchild, director of the Urban Freight Lab , a public/private partnership at the University of Washington in Seattle that works to find solutions to urban delivery challenges. In a typical warehouse, workers are the only ones to enter and exit, while strangers are prohibited from entering. Drawing a comparison with post-9/11 safety measures, Goodchild noted that the terrorist attacks led airports to close off departure gates to everyone but the passenger, and that simultaneously many ports began to deny entry to truckers.

The Target executives agreed that focusing on brick-and-mortar retail has also helped the brand achieve results when it comes to digital fulfillment. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . LAS VEGAS — Target dropped $7 billion on a chain-wide operations overhaul two years ago. In 2017, CEO Brian Cornell announced that the chain would be injecting investments into things like small-format locations in urban areas, store remodeling projects, team members, and owned brands. Skeptical of the company's decision to pour cash into brick-and-mortar rather than clear-cut e-commerce, Wall Street sent shares spiraling down in the wake of the announcement. But, according to the two Target executives who spoke at the second annual Groceryshop conference in Las Vegas on Sunday, the massive spending campaign has paid off in a major way. ""We're really excited, looking at the results that we just posted,"" Target's vice president of real estate Laurie Mahowald said. ""And 2018 has been the best year we've had in over a decade."" In her keynote speech later in the day, Target's executive vice president of food and beverage Stephanie Lundquist described the chain's strategy as a decision ""to strengthen some of the things our guests say they love about Target, like our owned brands, our stores, and our team.""

The suit was filed by Kroger in 2016, alleging that Visa attempted to influence its plans for how to handle EMV debit card payments, according to Digital Transactions . The retailer reportedly complained that Visa approved its new EMV point-of-sale (POS) terminals that would request a PIN rather than a signature from consumers, but later threatened fines and the possibility of removing Kroger's ability to accept Visa's debit cards to make it change its plans because the new terminals would route payments away from Visa's network.
