On Monday, HDFC Securities announced a report stating that demands similar to pre-covid levels were spotted in two-wheelers, passenger cars and tractor segments. According to the report 'Autos & Transportations Q2FY21 Results Preview' prepared by the Institutional Research Desk at HDFC Securities, sales recovery is led by further opening of various regions (Unlock 5.0), sustained rural demand and inventory build-up ahead of the festive season. ""We expect an all-round improvement in margins in 2QFY21 driven by rising utilisation levels (production is now running at 65-90 per cent of capacity),"" said Aditya Makharia, Institutional Research Analyst (auto), in the report. ""Correspondingly, valuation multiples for auto companies continue to re-rate and are now trading at levels between mean 'P/E and +1std deviation',"" Makharia added. As per the report, Nifty Auto index is up a further 20 per cent over the quarter versus 9 per cent for the broader Nifty. ""We believe that stock price returns will be driven by retail trends in the festive season as well as expectations of supportive government policy (GST reduction, scrappage scheme).

This is likely to constrain demand from first-time car buyers as well as upgraders despite their preference for private transportation due to hygiene reasons.

But now Srichand Hinduja, 84, the patriarch of the family, and his daughter, Vinoo, want the letter declared worthless.The dispute between the U.K.-based family came to a light in a ruling delivered Tuesday by a London judge, who said that the three other brothers, Gopichand, Prakash and Ashok, tried to use the letter to take control of Hinduja Bank -- an asset that was in Srichand’s sole name.Srichand and Vinoo want the court to rule that the letter should have “no legal effect” and cannot be used as a will, the judge said. She said that Srichand had insisted as early as 2016 that the July letter doesn’t reflect his wishes and that the family’s assets should be separated.A lawyer for Srichand didn’t respond to messages seeking comment.In a statement, the three brothers said that the litigation will have no impact on their business and that the proceedings “go against our founder’s and family’s values.” They said these principles have stood for decades, especially the idea that “everything belongs to everyone and nothing belongs to anyone.”“We intend to defend the claim to uphold these dearly held family values,” the three brothers said in an email.If the claim succeeds then all assets in Srichand’s name would pass to his daughter and her immediate family, including the entire shareholding in Hinduja Bank, the three brothers had said, according to the ruling.",AL,en,Economic Times India
