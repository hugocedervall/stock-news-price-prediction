Furthermore, it views the extended political uncertainty during Malaysia’s transition away from one-party rule as leading to stalling, even backsliding, reform momentum. “Combined with less favourable demographics and reduced fiscal space to cushion against future negative shocks to the economy, these factors all spell a much lower growth rate over the coming decade,” it said in a report. On the political front, the research arm of Fitch Ratings laid out that the defeat of the long-ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition in the 2018 election by Pakatan Harapan (PH) has resulted in a fluid and uncertain political landscape which will remain in the next decade. With both politicians and electorate alike adjusting to the new reality, it expects power to change hands often, leading to questionable policy continuity and stalled reform momentum. “Concerns over political stability were cemented with the political crisis in February 2020 after the PH government was deposed after backroom manoeuvres sparked by interpersonal and inter-party rivalries within the four-party coalition,” it said.",PH,en,The Sun Daily

He said this and other allegations made by Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak regarding the toll concession restructuring -- which would see highway users enjoy an 18 per cent toll rate reduction starting in February -- showed that the former prime minister was sulking (“merajuk”). “Clearly he is sulking because Pakatan Harapan (PH) has succeeded in finding a solution to the high (and rising) toll rates during the Barisan Nasional (BN) era whereas he had failed to do so. “Based on the PH formula, highway users stand to enjoy a big discount, the government will make savings due to the PLUS debt write-off and not having to pay compensation for the discounted toll rates throughout the concession period,” Pua said in a statement today. He said since the PH government announced the toll rate reduction, Najib had criticised the measure non-stop although, through his Facebook posts, he cited the government’s statement that highway users would save RM26 billion while the government would save RM42 billion for the remainder of the concession.",PH,en,The Sun Daily
