And that plan is: Offering Americans a $1,500 ""incentive payment"" to acquiesce to receiving both doses of the vaccine. Delaney argued that the plan would benefit all Americans, even those who still refuse, because it might help the country crush the virus more quickly.

Last year, these improper payments totaled $175 billion – that’s about $15 billion per month, $500 million per day, and $1 million a minute. But what exactly is an improper payment? Federal law defines the term as “payments made by the government to the wrong person, in the wrong amount, or for the wrong reason."" When people or companies receive incorrect payments, it erodes trust and hinders the government’s ability to finance everything from defense to health care.

As President-Elect Biden continues to round out his roster of appointees, he has tapped an Obama-era chair of the Federal Reserve to lead his administration's economic policy. According to a Wall Street Journal exclusive published on Nov. 23, the Biden team plans to nominate Janet Yellen to serve as Treasury Secretary. Obama originally appointed Yellen to the Fed in 2014, where she remained until early 2018. In a term that lined up with a massive expansion of public knowledge of cryptocurrencies and ended right after Bitcoin's dramatic 2017 bull run, Yellen was consistently critical of the space, calling Bitcoin ""anything but useful"" in October of 2018. Times have, however, changed dramatically in just two years. At the end of 2017, Yellen dismissed the notion that the Fed was looking into issuing a digital dollar.

Which begs the question: Exactly how do you buy gold? And perhaps more importantly, why would anyone want to? The short answer is that gold can be a smart way to diversify a portfolio — especially one filled with the usual investment suspects: stocks, bonds, and funds. Not only is gold largely immune to inflation, instead hewing closely to the cost of living, but gold also serves as a hedge against economic disaster. When the rest of the stock market falls, gold often goes the other way, appreciating in value and protecting the canny investor against major losses in other financial assets. For those reasons, many finance experts suggest investing 5-10% of your portfolio in gold, potentially going as high as 15% in times of political or economic crisis. There's the option of investing in gold securities, but purchasing physical gold is appealing for many investors because it represents the ""purest"" way to invest.",IRS,en,Business Insider

""In the typical tax system, the IRS uses 1099 reporting,"" Walker told Cointelegraph in an interview. ""So, 1099, W2, that tax reporting, it's the primary tool that they use to enforce tax compliance,"" she added. When people fail to report their crypto activities, the IRS is left with a headache. In 2019, 10,000 crypto-involved people received warning letters from the IRS , informing some folks that they owed money, or had incurred fines. Others were told to add their crypto activities onto their reporting. The tax authority also just recently added a question to the top of the 1040 form, asking filers if they handled crypto at all during the relative tax year. ""Now they're getting back all of this information to substantiate that they have to sift through,"" Walker explained.

For instance, a married couple filing a joint return with $100,000 of taxable income in 2021 won't pay $22,000 in tax just because their total taxable income falls within the 22% bracket for joint filers.",IRS,en,Kiplinger Washington Editors

The probes stem from the fact that cannabis is illegal in the eyes of the US federal government, though it's legal for at least some uses in 33 states . The audits are centered on a section of the federal tax code known as 280E that was passed to aid former US President Ronald Reagan's war on drugs, and the uptick is a reminder of the industry's continued precarity, even as there is growing support for legalizing marijuana. Five lawyers and accountants told Business Insider their clients have been seeing an uptick in audits and investigations in recent months. Most traced the uptick to March, while one said the increased scrutiny of the US cannabis industry began late last year. 'They're coming after everything' ""It really is a lesson that they're coming after everything,"" Eric Berlin, the co-head of the law firm Dentons' Cannabis Group, said in a webinar on investigations related to 280E last month. ""I don't mean that in a mean way, but anything is fair game, so it's a lesson and a reminder to get one's compliance house in order."" 280E prohibits companies that illegally sell drugs from deducting regular business expenses, like office supplies or health insurance premiums.",IRS,en,Business Insider

These afforded a rare glimpse behind the curtains which usually conceal the president's financial affairs. Perhaps one of the more audacious moves Trump made, according to the NYT report, was his claiming of a rebate from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of $72.9 million starting in 2010. Trump responded to the NYT report on Twitter last Monday saying it was driven by ""illegally obtained information & only bad intent,"" adding, ""I paid many millions of dollars in taxes but was entitled, like everyone else, to depreciation & tax credits."" His tweet gives us some idea of the timetable of his taxation techniques, which hinge on the relationship that money has with time on a balance sheet. Depreciation takes into account an asset's loss of value over time. The example of a car owned by a fictional taxi business illustrates the way depreciation can reduce a tax bill: If we assume a car costs $5,000 and generates $1,000 in revenue for a year, after business expenses of petrol and insurance of $200 for the year, profit is $800, on which the government levies a tax at 50%, reducing take-home pay to $400.",IRS,en,Business Insider

When contemplating a deductible expense, there are three hurdles that you have to clear: (1) Is the expense deductible per the Code?, (2) Are the conditions that make the expense deductible met?, and (3) Can you actually take the deduction? (e.g. although you can deduct mortgage interest as an itemized deduction, if your itemized deductions are less than the standard deduction, you won't get a tax benefit from taking the mortgage deduction)."" I know it sounds mundane, but during my career as a tax professional, this lesson has served me well in helping clients understand their ability to deduct expenses and keep them from running afoul of the IRS.",IRS,en,Business Insider

Trump earned $197 million directly from appearing on ""The Apprentice"" between 2004 and 2015 and earned a further $230 million from licensing deals, sponsorships, and seminars that followed his fame, tax records reviewed by the Times showed. Trump's income from ""The Apprentice"" and licensing deals reduced considerably after 2011, from $51 million to $21 million by 2014, and eventually to less than $3 million in 2018, the report said. He stopped appearing on the show in 2015, but still made money from it.

2020-09-21 10:46:04-05:00,The Annuity With a Tax-Planning Twist,"Retirees sometimes feel like they’re being squeezed by two opposing goals. On the one hand, they should conserve their nest egg to prepare for longer life expectancies and the rising cost of long-term care. On the other, the IRS requires retirees to start drawing down their savings with required minimum distributions at age 72. SEE MORE QLACs Can Deliver Late-in-Life Income A qualified life annuity contract satisfies both goals. QLACs are a type of deferred income annuity. You transfer a portion of your savings from a retirement account, like an IRA or a 401(k), to an annuity company to purchase your contract. As of 2020, you can invest the lesser of $135,000 or 25% of your retirement account balance in a QLAC. The annuity company turns your deposit into payments, which you can delay taking until as late as age 85. Once you start receiving annuity income, the payments are guaranteed to last your entire life. Steven Kaye, managing director at Wealth Enhancement Group in Warren, N.J., describes QLACs as a form of longevity insurance. “If life expectancy at retirement is 85, that means half of retirees will live longer than age 85,” Kaye says. “By converting a portion of their savings into a QLAC, they create a stream of future income that they cannot outlive.” Although QLACs have been on the scene since 2014, they are hardly a household name, but legislation in 2019 and a rising tide of baby boomers entering their 70s could launch these contracts out of obscurity and into the retirement planning spotlight.",IRS,en,Kiplinger Washington Editors

Many people around the country are getting stimulus checks, or they will soon, which are basically catch-up payments, involving stimulus money they should have received already. That's why these stimulus checks aren't ""new,"" in that they involve money which should have been received earlier this year. Such as the $500 dependent payment many stimulus recipients didn't receive even though they should have. The $2.2 trillion CARES Act that Congress passed back at the end of March was a one-of-a-kind piece of federal legislation for several reasons, one of which is that it represented a massive congressional response to the coronavirus pandemic -- one that hasn't been equaled or matched since. Also, it was the biggest such stimulus package in the history of the country, including $1,200 stimulus checks as part of its grab bag of benefits meant to take at least a small part of the financial sting away from people hurt by the economic fallout of the pandemic.",IRS,en,BGR

Cohen responded: ""Yeah, the fact that he doesn't report the income that he claims, his wealth is not as significant, and I believe that they were probably very lenient in how they took deductions."" He went on to claim that Trump's ""biggest fear is that if his tax return is released, that there's a whole slew of organizations of accountants and forensic accountants that will rip through it and he will end up with a massive tax bill, fraud penalties, fines and possibly even tax fraud.""

Terry Link pleaded guilty in federal court Wednesday to a felony charge of tax evasion. Link, a Democrat from Indian Creek who resigned his seat last week, admitted in a plea agreement that he willfully underreported his income on his federal and state tax returns from 2012 through 2016. Specifically, the plea agreement noted that in 2016, Link reported income of $264,450 when, in fact, he had total income of at least $358,309. The difference included $73,159 in money from his campaign account that he used for personal purposes. As part of the plea agreement, Link agreed to pay restitution of $71,133 to the IRS, and $11,527 to the Illinois Department of Revenue. Federal sentencing guidelines provide a maximum sentence for tax evasion of up to three years in prison and a $100,000 fine. However, based on Link’s lack of criminal history and other factors, his sentence would more likely be in the range of 10-16 months, according to the plea agreement. Link will not face immediate sentencing, however, because he also agreed to cooperate with continuing federal investigations, according to the agreement.",IRS,en,Sauk Valley Media

However, the IRS is sending out a small round of new stimulus checks this month (about 50,000). Those new stimulus checks are a kind of catch-up payment, meant to provide certain people with the money they should already have gotten. Instead of working with Congress to reach a new accord on stimulus legislation, several leaders who are key to the process -- like White House senior advisor Jared Kushner, Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and Democratic House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi -- all sat down with CNBC on Tuesday for separate interviews to talk about how hard the process has been. Kushner, for example, reiterated a theme we've heard for a while now relative to new stimulus and the possibility of most Americans getting a new stimulus check, telling CNBC that probably won't happen until after the election.

The self-employment tax (Social Security and Medicare) Income tax on the profits that your business made and any other income The self-employment tax rate on net income up to $132,900 is 15.3%.

Take your annual gross income—the total revenue you received—and deduct expenses and any deductions you’re eligible for. For example, if your annual revenue was $100,000 and you have business deductions that total $30,000, your taxable income is $70,000. $100,000 - $30,000 = $70,000 taxable income The Internal Revenue Service provides a full listing and reference guide for small business owners.",IRS,en,AOL

You generally have to make estimated tax payments if you expect to owe tax of $1,000 or more when you file your return. Estimated tax payments are made on a quarterly schedule established by the IRS. Major myths If you owe more than $1,000, the IRS wants its owed taxes paid during the year. Any missed quarterly payment will result in penalties and interest. Additionally, waiting until the end of the year to file and pay taxes may lead to other financial issues if you fail to reserve enough funds to satisfy your tax debt. Missing quarterly deadlines, even by one day, can mean accruing penalties and interest. If you miss a payment deadline, your best bet is to send your payment as soon as you can. You can also appeal any IRS penalties, if necessary. The IRS would rather collect tax payments than collect penalty payments, so any penalties you incur may be forgiven. What is a 1099?

SEE MORE What Trump's Payroll Tax Cut Will Mean for You Normally, the IRS only adds interest to refunds issued more than 45 days after the return due date. The typical tax return due date is April 15. However, because of the coronavirus pandemic, this year's filing deadline was pushed back to July 15 . The change is considered a disaster-related postponement, which means the IRS is required by law to pay interest calculated from the original April 15 filing deadline for anyone who files their return by the postponed deadline. This refund interest requirement only applies to individual income tax filers – businesses are not eligible. ",IRS,en,Kiplinger Washington Editors

The Obama administration was up to its eyeballs in scandals. It was Obama who finally said what had really happened, which was that “We didn’t have a scandal that embarrassed us.” In other words, the issue wasn’t that the administration was scandal-free. The issue was that the media protected the administration from voters’ wrath should they learn about those scandals. The Russia Hoax has benefitted from the media’s continued unwillingness to report on Obama-era scandals.

2020-08-02 05:55:00-05:00,How to stop robocalls and spam calls for good,"Filed under: Lifestyle , Living , Living Why do we get so many robocalls? “The short answer is that they work and they are very inexpensive,” explains Jeff Galak, associate professor of marketing at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business. Eliminating humans dialing phones means that marketers and scammers can reach millions of phones efficiently and cheaply. “And they work for two reasons,” Galak explains. “First, they can separate the diligent consumers from the less diligent (aka suckers). If you pick up a robocall and talk to the automated system, the caller now knows that there is a human on the other end of the phone and can sell that information to others who might try and call with some kind of sales promotion or, far worse, call with a scam of some sort. The second reason is that they are a fast way to get information—and sometimes disinformation—out to many people quickly. This is particularly true for older demographics who tend to rely more on phone calls than other forms of communication like emails, text messages, or social media.” Using a variety of schemes, a robocall operation that averages 10 to 15 million robocalls a day can earn a yearly profit of $200,000, says cybersecurity expert Julia Campbell. “If a robocall operation goes undetected for over a year, its profit can soar into the millions,” she adds.",IRS,en,AOL

While Democrats are looking to maintain the same income limits required to receive aid, Republicans are arguing for lower limits . In March, the CARES Act established that individuals with incomes of up to $75,000 and married couples making up to $150,000 would qualify for the full amount of $1,200 or $2,400 respectively. Individuals making over $99,000 and couples with no children who make over $198,000 annually are excluded from receiving payments. GOP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky wants that lowered , saying in a statement earlier this week ""I think the people that have been hit the hardest are people who make about $40,000 or less."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) slammed McConnell's suggestion, saying ""I think families making over $40,000 probably need assistance … depending on their family situation."" It’s unclear how committed Republicans are to lowering the income limits, and what exactly a lower ceiling would look like .",IRS,en,Zero Hedge

But economists told Business Insider that despite growing public support, taxing billionaires faces so many legal and administrative challenges that it isn't a feasible solution. Not only would a wealth tax have to get through both Houses of Congress — it would have to withstand a battle in front of the Supreme Court. The IRS would also have to rapidly expand and reorganize itself to be to enforce such a tax, and it's likely that evasion would still likely keep the tax from raising as much government funding as proponents hope.

Even though the tax deadline was extended to July 15 this year, the IRS will be paying interest on any refunds issued after April 15, according to a decision made by the agency last week.

The agency hasn't estimated how many people will receive interest but it has processed about 11 million refunds between mid-April and mid-June already.

Lawmakers seem to be slowly moving toward approval of a new stimulus package that would send out a fresh wave of checks to Americans. Here's an estimate of how big your next stimulus check could be.

That works out to an average of a little more than $1,676 for each household -- though the talk has now turned to when and if federal lawmakers might approve another round of stimulus payments sometime soon, given the damage and ongoing nature of the coronavirus pandemic . President Trump has said more checks will be coming, and while we don't have final legislation to that effect yet that's been passed by both houses of Congress, we can make at least a little bit of a prediction as to how big the average American's next stimulus check will be based on the information we do have at this point.",IRS,en,BGR

Behind the scenes, however, the Treasury’s responsibilities have fallen largely to the 42-year-old deputy secretary, Justin Muzinich. A major beneficiary of that bailout so far: Muzinich & Co., the asset manager founded by his father where Justin served as president before joining the administration. He reported owning a stake worth at least $60 million when he entered government in 2017. Today, Muzinich retains financial ties to the firm through an opaque transaction in which he transferred his shares in the privately held company to his father. Ethics experts say the arrangement is troubling because his father received the shares for no money up front, and it appears possible that Muzinich can simply get his stake back after leaving government.",IRS,en,Zero Hedge

If so, don't automatically think it's some sort of scam. It might actually be the stimulus check payment you've been waiting for - just in the form of a prepaid debit card. The cards - called Economic Impact Payment Cards, or EIP Cards, by the IRS - will go to certain people who filed a tax return but don't have bank information on file with the tax agency. Instead of mailing a paper check (which takes longer to process), the cards will be sent to the most recent mailing address on file with the IRS. [EMBED TYPE=WIDGET ID=927] If you receive one of these EIP Cards, you'll probably have a lot of questions about how it works. Where can I use it? Are there any fees? Can the IRS track my purchases?

That said, the budget also assumes the economy will grow at 3% for the next 15 years, which seems more than a bit ambitious. “The White House's election-year budget will show the economy growing at an average rate of 3% for the next 15 years”…..we haven’t grown at 3% for a full calendar year since 2005 and we averaged 1.8% annual growth over the last 15 years. — GreekFire23 (@GreekFire23) February 9, 2020 As the Wall Street Journal notes, ""Among the agencies that would receive the biggest boost is NASA, which would see a 12% increase next year as Mr.",IRS,en,Zero Hedge

This radio silence, save for a few sprinkled bits of negativity, makes one thing very surprising: bitcoin was one of the highest performing assets of 2019. Even including the recent downturn, the asset has about doubled in value this year. This is great news for everyone who joined at the beginning of this year.

Business owners and freelancers should only purchase items that fit their businesses' needs and complete equipment purchases and estimated tax prepayments before December 31 to reduce tax liability. Other expenses may not qualify if they aren't used this year, and some retirement accounts can be funded in 2020 and still credited on the 2019 return. Before making any major year-end financial commitments, business owners should consult a certified public accountant who can help navigate the rules in the 2017 tax law. Visit BI Prime for more stories. If 2019 was a profitable year for your business, that can mean a larger tax liability in April. As the year comes to a close, time is running out for business owners to make purchases and other investments to maximize the deductions on their 2019 tax bill. But not all December spending is equal. Being smart about when you spend is nearly as important as what you spend in the weeks before Tax Day 2020 .

2019-11-19 12:46:39-05:00,10 IRS Audit Red Flags for Retirees,"You may be wondering about your odds of an IRS audit. Most people can breathe easy. The vast majority of individual returns escape the IRS audit machine. In 2018, the Internal Revenue Service audited only 0.59% of all individual tax returns, and 81% of these exams were conducted by mail, meaning most taxpayers never met with an IRS agent in person. So the odds are generally pretty low that your return will be picked for review. That said, your chances of being audited or otherwise hearing from the IRS escalate depending on various factors. Math errors may draw IRS inquiry, but they'll rarely lead to a full-blown exam. Check out these 10 red flags that could increase the chances that the IRS will give the return of a retired taxpayer special, and probably unwelcome, attention.

Nearly a decade later, the full repercussions of the uprisings are starting to hit home with some governments adopting a new strategy to curtail their influence: taxing social media usage. Arab Spring protesters primarily used social media networks to successfully effect regime changes. And now some autocratic governments are hitting back by trying to limit citizens’ access to these tools. One such country is Uganda. The East African nation with a population of 43 million has become the latest country to attempt to gag the voice of its citizens after imposing a social media tax intended to ‘‘curb gossip.’’ The Ugandan government has introduced a tax of 200 Uganda shilling (5.4 cents) a day to use social sites such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and others.

Now, with tax session approaching its peak, we can quantify just how big the ""shortfall"" at least relative to taxpayer expectations and Wall Street estimates will be. As UBS calculates, the realized net payments to households are now running below the bank's forecast, with the cumulative shortfall rising to a whopping $45.5bln , an amount which could have significant adverse implications on Americans' spending habits if most taxpayers had expected their 2019 refund to be similar to 2018. That said, there is a specific reason why refunds have been running behind expectations: last week’s dramatic shortfall in tax refunds arises largely from timing of refunds that include the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit. According to the Department of Treasury, the IRS had processed less than half of those payments, whereas in 2018 all such credits had been completed (Treasury statement).",IRS,en,Zero Hedge

The total number of refunds was down 26.5 percent to 23.5 million, it said. - Bloomberg The Treasury Department said in a late Friday statement that they have received massive public interest in taxpayer data from the current tax filing season, and that while refunds are down, individuals' overall tax liability has also fallen - resulting in larger paychecks. ""The size of someone’s tax refund says nothing about whether their taxes have gone up or down,"" reads the statement.

The lower valuations create a windfall for employees and can lower their tax burdens going forward. The report analyzed recent initial public offerings and identified 68 companies that gave employees stock options to buy about $1.5 billion worth of stock during the 12 month run up to each respective company's IPO. The fair market value of those shares, however, was an estimated $2.2 billion at the time, based on a valuation model developed by academics. This is the equivalent of a 32% discount on shares for employees. Will Gornall, an assistant finance professor at the University of British Columbia, said: “The Journal’s findings show that the valuations being reported by companies are significantly below what the shares are really worth —the price that investors would pay for them.” This year, these types of valuations will be in focus as names like Uber and Pinterest prepare to go public.",IRS,en,Zero Hedge

The not so good news is that for the fiscal year through Dec.31, the total US budget deficit was $319 billion, 40% greater than the $227 billion deficit for the prior year, and set to keep rising this year to $1.1 trillion. However, a more concerning data point emerges when looking at the annual change in the rolling 12 month total.

We are born free, and we will stay free.” But this uplifting sentiment cannot survive even a brief glance at the federal statute book or the heavy-handed enforcement tactics by federal, state, and local bureaucracies across the nation.

There is, for example, talk of a 70% marginal tax rate for income above $10 million.

Since this is the Data section, let’s look at 2 sets of numbers that should inform US tax policy. Point #1: The history of Federal tax receipts as a percent of US GDP. This measures how various US individual/corporate tax regimes have altered the ability of the Federal government to increase revenue relative to the size of the US economy. A few points here: Even though the highest marginal individual/corporate tax rates have varied widely since World War II (from 50% - 90% in the 1940s/1950s to 21% - 37% now), total tax receipts as a percent of GDP have been remarkably stable.",IRS,en,Zero Hedge

The result is an extreme concentration of wealth not seen in any other leading economy. The Ultra-Millionaire Tax taxes the wealth of the richest Americans. It applies only to households with a net worth of $50 million or more-roughly the wealthiest 75,000 households, or the top 0.1%.",IRS,en,Zero Hedge
2019-01-25 17:05:00-05:00,"Elizabeth Warren's Wealth Confiscation Tax Would ""Redistribute"" 2.75 Trillion Dollars Over 10 Years","Authored by Michael Snyder via The Economic Collapse blog, Elizabeth Warren is making it exceedingly clear that she is a socialist, and that is quite frightening considering the fact that she could potentially become our next president. Unless some really big name unexpectedly enters the race, there is a decent chance that Elizabeth Warren could win the Democratic nomination in 2020. And if she ultimately won the general election, the Democrats would likely have control of both the House and the Senate during her first two years in the White House as well. So that means that the proposal that you are about to read about could actually become law in the not too distant future. After AOC’s proposal to raise the top marginal tax rate to 70 percent received so much favorable attention , it was just a matter of time before Democratic presidential candidates started jumping on the “soak the rich” bandwagon, and the first one to strike was Elizabeth Warren. When she announced her new proposal on Twitter, she dubbed it the “Ultra-Millionaire Tax” … We need structural change.",IRS,en,Zero Hedge

The latest of Musk's ventures being scrutinized is now his charitable foundation, which was the subject of a Guardian longform write-up this week. The article states that Musk's charitable foundation has gone to enrich causes close to, or directly tied to, Musk and his immediate family. The charity has given more money to artificial intelligence causes than to any of the traditional charities that it supports, according to the article. The charity's website, MuskFoundation.org, states that grants are made in support of: Renewable energy research and advocacy Human space exploration research and advocacy Pediatric research Science and engineering education Development of safe artificial intelligence to benefit humanity We all know that Musk likes to be the center of attention when it comes to charitable causes, whether it is embarrassing himself trying to unprovokedly thrust his services into the Thai cave rescue or claiming that he’s going to fix the water crisis in Michigan.",IRS,en,Zero Hedge
2019-01-23 10:51:01-05:00,"Shutdown Woes Deepen As 800,000 Federal Workers To Miss Second Paycheck; IRS Employees Bail","With negotiations behind the partial government shutdown showing no signs of a breakthrough, an estimated 800,000 government employees are set to miss a second paycheck on Friday. Roughly 420,000 federal employees are working without pay, while around 380,000 have been furloughed amid the longest shutdown in US history, according to CNBC . While the actual economic impacts are thus far thought to be limited, specific companies and industries are feeling the effects. Commercial airlines, for example, are facing slower demand as airports struggle with understaffed security checkpoints, are losing revenue. Last week, Delta said it had lost $25 million in revenue on account of the shutdown . The hit to the overall gross domestic product in the first quarter is also difficult to quantify. Economists have come up with a range of numbers, but they agree that the longer the shutdown goes on, the wider the damage to economic growth. - CNBC Hundreds of IRS employees, meanwhile, will probably skip work as part of a coordinated protest which takes advantage of a provision which allows them to stay home if they suffer a ""hardship,"" according to the Washington Post .",IRS,en,Zero Hedge

Don't Make Me Laugh!""","Authored by Ron Paul via The Ron Paul Institute for Peace & Prosperity, Campaign Finance Reform Helps Special Interests One of the new Democratic House majority’s top priorities is so-called campaign finance reform legislation. Contrary to the claims of its supporters, campaign finance reform legislation does not limit the influence of powerful special interests. Instead, it violates the First Amendment and burdens those seeking real change in government. The First Amendment of the Constitution forbids Congress from interfering in any way with any citizen’s ability to influence government policies. Spending money to support candidates and causes is one way individuals influence government policies. Therefore, laws limiting and regulating donations to campaigns and organizations that work to change government policies violate the First Amendment. One very troubling aspect of campaign finance reform laws is forcing organizations involved in “electioneering” to hand over the names of their top donors to the federal government.",IRS,en,Zero Hedge

2019-01-13 12:00:25-05:00,Real Tax Rates In The 60s Were Much Lower Than Ocasio-Cortez Thinks,"Authored by Andrew Syrios via The Mises Institute, Newly elected congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez may not be the expert on the Israeli and Palestinian conflict or what the three branches of the American government are , but she certainly thinks herself an expert on tax and energy policy. Her energy policy involves reducing carbon emissions to zero within 12 years. What will pay for the enormous amounts of subsidies necessary to make this happen? Well, it’s simple. As she says , “People are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes.” (FYI, here’s the liberal definition of fair share: Fair share (noun): “More… A lot more.”) She continued, “If you look at our tax rates back in the 60’s … once you get to like the tippy tops, on like your ten millionth dollar. Sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 or 70 percent.” In other words, the United States, with a measly 37 percent as its highest tax bracket, should join the rest of the developed world with radically higher taxes .",IRS,en,Zero Hedge
2019-01-09 12:09:25-05:00,"Mortgage Applications Explode Higher As Rates Tumble, Shutdown Loomed","Seemingly encouraged by the dramatic slide in mortgage rates into the end of the year (and perhaps incentivized ahead of the shutdown that impacted IRS' ability to income-verify), US mortgage applications exploded 23.5% last week, with both purchase and refinancing applications rising sharply. Refinancing applications jumped 35.3% (up 80.4%, unadjusted). While some of the spike reflects seasonal noise, part of the increase is likely due to actual activity given the recent decline in mortgage rates. Mortgage rates declined sharly last week. The effective rate on a conventional 30-year loan declined nine basis points to 4.88%, the lowest since April. As Oxford Economics points out, mortgage rates have declined 45 basis points from their recent peak in early November. Some of that decline is likely to be reversed in next week’s report given the recent backup in Treasury rates. Oxford Economics notes that on an unadjusted basis, purchase applications were up 59.0% last week. Purchase applications finished December with a 1.5% gain and are starting January 6.6% above the December average.",IRS,en,Zero Hedge
