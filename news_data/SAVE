""In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, these self-check-in facilities have become very crucial in minimising physical contact between our guests and staff,"" he said in a statement.

Spirit is arguably America's most loved to hate airline and after just one flight, it's clear why passengers might not enjoy the experience. Cramped seats, no in-flight entertainment, and a tired-looking plane all contributed to a lackluster flight.
