Dragos protects factories, oil fields, utilities like power companies, and other large industrial sites from cyberattacks. In other words, Lee's company addresses operational technology, not information technology. ""OT is all of IT, plus physics,"" Lee says. ""And it's where all the risk is."" The risk is building. Dragos has new research out Thursday that shows that cybercriminals are adopting new ransomware functionality with the ability to stop factories, disrupt utilities, and potentially damage critical infrastructure. The number of publicly reported ransomware attacks on manufacturing in 2020 is more than triple the number of 2019 attacks, based on data tracked by Dragos. The attacks included a March assault on steelmaker Evraz that shut down whole divisions of the company, causing more than 1,000 workers to be briefly out of work.",EVR,en,Business Insider

The bank's chief US equity strategist and chief investment officer said in a Monday note that he expects the market to drop another 10% in the near term as investors face uncertainty around the election outcome, more fiscal stimulus, and another wave of COVID-19. But once the dust settles, Wilson said he expects the bull market to ensue — one which will be led by cyclical and smaller-cap stocks as earnings get a boost from the economic recovery. As such, Wilson recommended using a near term sell-off as a buying opportunity. ""We think the best opportunities lie in stocks where earnings are growing with the cyclical rebound and growing by enough to offset any valuation headwinds,"" Wilson said. He continued: ""On any pullbacks, we would look to our earnings upside screen from September — 66% of stocks have outperformed the market with median outperformance of 2.",EVR,en,Business Insider

The growth in performance obligations show AWS is likely signing up more large enterprise customers who prefer long-term contracts. But the coronavirus could slow the pace of enterprise growth for AWS, as travel bans and conference cancellations make it harder to close deals. D.A. Davidson's Tom Forte says the impact will likely show up in future quarters as the coronavirus started affecting US businesses in the second half of this quarter. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . Amazon Web Services has been focused on signing up more large business customers in recent years, as it continues to expand beyond the tech startup community that first adopted its cloud technology. That shift is important because large businesses typically sign longer-term contracts — unlike smaller companies that prefer the pay-as-you-go model — making them a bigger and more predictable source of revenue.",EVR,en,Business Insider
