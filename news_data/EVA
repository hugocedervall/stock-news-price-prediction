2019-09-19 17:30:00-05:00,The best men's leather dress boots you can buy for under $500,"Dress boots for men can be costly but, with proper care, think of a good pair as an investment that could last for a very long time. Thursday Boot Co.'s Wingtip heads the top of the list with its outstanding quality and value. Dress boots may be the most versatile footwear out there. They look as good with an old pair of jeans as they do with a suit and give off a slightly rugged, masculine vibe without being in your face about it. A dress boot, unlike a hiker or a work boot, doesn't typically have a fat outsole, so you're not going to go hiking in the Sierras or do construction in these, but they're sturdy enough to handle rain and snow, especially compared to, say, a pair of Italian loafers. While dress boots tend to be a bit pricey, they're three-season footwear and with proper care, will last you for years. Additionally, since these styles are pretty timeless you won't look outdated down the road. We've put together a list of our favorite quality men's dress boots under $500. I've either personally tested these or in some cases have relied on customer and other professional reviews.",EVA,en,Business Insider

2019-06-18 17:30:00-05:00,The best water shoes you can buy for kids,"Kids' water shoes help keep sensitive little feet safe against sharp rocks and shells and protected from the hot sand, and they dry off after dips in the pool, lake, or ocean. Many kids' water shoes are styled to look like regular footwear, so your children can live in them all summer long. The Merrell Little Kid's Bare Steps H2O Sneakers are our top choice because they are comfortable without needing breaking in and stay snug even on the littlest feet. My family lives about a half-mile from a bay on the North Shore of Long Island, New York, and our summers involve frequent trips to the beaches where we kayak, canoe, swim, and explore. North Shore beaches tend to be littered with rocks and shells, and I wince with most steps despite my callused 36-year-old feet; there's no way I'd ever ask my young kids to walk around on such surfaces without their feet protected, thus along with the sunblock, hats, and life jackets, every trip to the water involves kids' water shoes. But truth be told, my son and daughter (five and one, respectively, at the time of this writing) get the most use out of their water shoes not during our frequent aquatic adventures, but right in our home's backyard.",EVA,en,Business Insider
