If it's red, that means the Liquid Contact Indicator (LCI) has been activated and there is water damage. It should appear white or silver if there is no damage. Apple's iPhone warranty does not cover water damage — and even though newer models have increased water resistance , continued exposure to water can still damage your device over time. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . With its brand new iPhone 11 Pro , Apple has increased water resistance from previous models. An iPhone 11 Pro is now supposedly resistant in up to four meters of water for 30 minutes, compared to two meters for 30 minutes with an iPhone XS . But that doesn't mean you should go around submerging your iPhone in every liquid you find. Just because your iPhone might be water resistant under certain conditions doesn't mean it won't affect your device — continued exposure to water can still lead to damage over time, and other liquids like coffee or soda can also damage your phone.",LCI,en,Business Insider
