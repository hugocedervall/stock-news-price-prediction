The doubters who have him particularly down are criticizing him for taking orders for hydrogen fuel cell-powered semis and saying they’re worth $10 billion.The number has come under scrutiny for a few reasons. For starters, reservations for Nikola’s truck cost nothing. Milton says the company took money initially but paid it all back after Tesla Inc. got criticized for funding itself a similar way.“We had deposits with thousands and thousands of trucks, and we just decided, ‘You know what, it’s not worth people thinking that we’re a Ponzi scheme, fake startup that’s using people’s money,’” Milton said in an interview Thursday from his Utah ranch.Now, with 14,000 orders but no cash to show for it, the antagonists are out in full force.",WOR,en,Economic Times India

BTX is an important building block for a variety of widely used products including pharmaceuticals, clothing, and glues. Regular BTX is typically derived from the catalytic reforming of naphtha in a petroleum refinery. Striving toward a waste-free future, some technology companies have been looking at sustainable ways to create BTX. Encina has developed a process that economically extracts BTX from plastic waste through catalytic pyrolysis. It enables the “cracking” of hydrocarbons to create pygas, which contains the aromatics. Encina's proprietary technology can extract BTX from plastics in varying conditions, eliminating the labor-intensive process of sorting, cleaning, and baling.
