In pre-market trading, Intel tumbled 9% after a surprise drop in data-center sales. Gilead Sciences jumped after its antiviral therapy becoming the first drug formally cleared to treat Covid-19. The final debate between Trump and Biden on Thursday presented few surprises for election watchers and if anything, merely reinforced investor caution heading into the Nov. 3 election. While Biden blamed Donald Trump for the deaths of more than 220,000 Americans in the coronavirus pandemic in the debate late Thursday, and Trump accused Biden of corruption in China and Ukraine, their exchanges didn’t move markets much.

Early in the evening, China home prices beat expectations rising at a 0.42% MoM clip - the best since Oct 2019…because who wouldn't want to be bidding up prices in China right now... Source: Bloomberg Earlier in the month, the manufacturing PMIs suggested some further stabilization, though not much of a strengthening last month. Exports dropped, though by less than anticipated, at -3.3% year-on-year, while imports tumbled hard, with a 16.7% slide. And then the big China data dump hit: Industrial Production -2.8% YTD YoY (slightly better than the expected 3% drop and an improvement on last last month) Retail Sales -13.5% YTD YoY (matched expectations and improved from the 16.2% drop last month) Fixed Asset Investment -6.3% YTD YoY (worse than the expected 6.0% drop but an improvement over last month) Property Investment -0.3% YTD YoY (better than the 0.8% drop expected and a big improvement from the 3.3% drop last month) Surveyed Jobless Rate 5.9% (as expected and better than the 6.0% last month) However, on a straight YoY basis - all three of the ""big"" ones missed: China Retail Sales -2.8% Y/Y, Exp. -2.3% Fixed Investment -6.3% Y/Y, Exp. -6.0% Industrial Output 4.4% Y/Y, Exp. 5.0% The immediate takeaway perhaps is that China’s economy continues to improve (after the crushing Q1 blow due to COVID-19 containment-driven shutdowns) but that pace of recovery may not be living up to expectations.",EXP,en,Zero Hedge
