2020-08-06 14:53:09-05:00,Why The Cushing Storage Hub Matters To Oil,"The oil market has begun to adjust to the ""new normal"" in the global economy, with significantly lower fuel demand and decreased oil production. In the wake of the demand collapse and lower refinery utilization rates, storage levels for crude oil have finally peaked and are starting to decline as the economic recovery from COVID-19 begins. The Nexus of Oil Fundamentals At the heart of the global pricing network is the Cushing, Oklahoma crude oil storage hub, which provides the physical delivery mechanism for the CME Group's NYMEX WTI futures contract. When the WTI futures contract was first listed in 1983, Cushing was a vibrant hub for cash market trading of crude oil with a network of pipelines, refineries and storage terminals. Today, Cushing is the key nexus of market fundamentals for the global crude oil market, with nearly two dozen pipelines and 20 storage terminals.

This forecast was impressive for two reasons: just 20 days later, the prompt WTI contract indeed plunged into negative territory for the first time ever as those who were set to receive delivery of WTI barrels had no space to store it and ending paying buyers to take it off their hands, sending the price of the maturing contract to as low as negative $40.

Smith told Hedgeweek that the “extraordinary” events of recent days - which saw West Texas Intermediate futures prices dip into negative territory for the first time ever – have unnerved markets and carry “far reaching implications” for commodities markets. Westbeck’s Energy Opportunity fund is up 17 per cent so far in April, having advanced some 20 per cent during March. The London-based long/short specialist strategy has been positioned “short the front end, long the back” and has also traded a basket of producing E&Ps which Smith believes are “certain” to survive any price shock. At the same time, the fund has cut its gross exposures sharply as volatility remains elevated. “It is important to remember that oil demand is not going away after this pandemic, and we strongly believe that those producing companies with long life assets are going to be amongst the best performers in equity markets generally, on the other side, as the oil price rallies strongly,” observed Smith, a former head of natural resources at CQS, Sir Michael Hintze’s long-running multi-strategy hedge fund.",WTI,en,Hedgeweek

US crude futures slumped in dramatic fashion on Monday, with the front-month May contract, which expired yesterday, settling at negative US$37.63 a barrel. That steep fall came as traders scrambled to get out of the contract to avoid taking delivery of barrels for fear of nowhere to store the oil and lack of customers who want to buy it. While that trade is somewhat anomalous, the steep decline in both Brent and US futures expiring in June shows that the market is worried that the overwhelming supply and weak demand will leave barrels without a home for weeks to come.

Global crude oil prices tanked Monday amid continued concerns over the coronavirus pandemic's impact on energy demand and the ongoing price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia. West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the US benchmark dropped below $20 a barrel in Asian trading while Brent crude hit $23.03, its lowest price since 2002. Both sets of futures regained some of their early losses in European trading hours but remain down. Brent crude is down 6.2% at $26.23 while WTI is down 5.7% at $20.21 as of 9.00 a.m. in London (4.00 a.m. ET).

In short, assuming a similar export mix as in 2017, this would translate into an unprecedented 235% volumetric increase in 2020 US agricultural exports to China over 2019. The problem is that while US exports to China had declined sharply in 2018, other nations stepped in, in many cases with long-term bilateral contracts in place ensuring the long-term delivery of ag products from mostly Latin American substitute markets. This, as Goldman points out, means that such an increase in Chinese purchases from the US "" would likely be hugely disruptive to global agriculture markets, primarily crowding out Argentine and Brazilian supplies that have taken substantial market share since 2017 due to the trade war and much weaker currencies.

The sentiment across the board is that traders are waiting for the Fed's decision on a rate cut — most think that one is coming it's just how big a cut. Oil prices also slipped after falling sharply on Tuesday, but are still well above pre-strike levels. View Markets Insider's homepage for more stories. Markets on Wednesday look set to open muted with ""all eyes are on the Fed,"" as traders wait to see what the Fed's decision on interest rates will be on Wednesday afternoon. The consensus among economists and traders alike is that there will be a cut — it's just how big a cut is what we're waiting for. Most are expecting a 25 basis point cut, and then one later in the year, but there is a chance Trump could get his wish of a 50-basis point cut after consistently lashing out at Jerome Powell for not acting swiftly to boost the economy. Powell is expected to give the Fed's decision about rates at 2 p.m. in Washington.

The sources said that tens of tons that Daesh had been keeping in their last hotbed in al-Baghouz area in Deir Ezzor countryside have been handed to the Americans, adding up to other tons of gold that Americans have found in other hideouts for Daesh, making the total amount of gold taken by the Americans to the US around 50 tons, leaving only scraps for the SDF [Kurdish] militias that serve them [the US operation]. Recently, sources said that the area where Daesh leaders and members have barricaded themselves in, contains around 40 tons of gold and tens of millions of dollars. Allegedly, “US occupation forces in the Syrian al-Jazeera area made a deal with Daesh terrorists, by which Washington gets tens of tons of gold that the terror organization had stolen, in exchange for providing safe passage for the terrorists and their leaders from the areas in Deir Ezzor where they are located.” ISIS was financing its operations largely by the theft of oil from the oil wells in the Deir Ezzor area, Syria’s oil-producing region, and they transported and sold this stolen oil via their allied forces, through Turkey, which was one of those US allies trying to overthrow Syria’s secular Government and install a Sunni fundamentalist regime that would be ruled from Riyadh (i.e., controlled by the Saud family) .",WTI,en,Zero Hedge

Yet what has left traders puzzled is that despite gold's surge, it is not trading as a safe haven, because after correlating inversely with the S&P for much of 2018, the correlation flipped to positive in late-December, right around the time the Fed flipped from hawkish to dovish, meaning that gold has instead regained its status as a hedge against central bank idiocy. Indeed, gold's correlation to the S&P has paradoxically surpassed that to other safe havens such as Treasurys, the yen, the Swiss franc and even the USD.

This directive was particularly surprising in the context of Canada’s free market economy, where oil production is rarely so directly regulated. Canada’s recent oil glut woes are not due to a lack of demand, but rather a severe lack of pipeline infrastructure. There is plenty of demand, and more than enough supply, but no way to get the oil flowing where it needs to go. Canada’s pipelines are running at maximum capacity, storage facilities are filled to bursting, and the pipeline bottleneck has only continued to worsen . Now, in an effort to alleviate the struggling industry, Alberta’s oil production has been cut 8.7 percent according to the mandate set by the province’s government under Rachel Notley with the objective of cutting out around 325,000 barrels per day from the Canadian market.",WTI,en,Zero Hedge
