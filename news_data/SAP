As the CEO of a company that offers AI-backed software tailored to industries like oil and gas, banking, and manufacturing, Siebel has a first-hand view into companies' struggles, which he blames on the fact that corporations ""most frequently attempt to build the applications themselves with their own IT organization"" instead of enlisting outside help. ""Probably 99 out of 100 are failing and they're all internal build projects that involve sometimes hundreds of thousands of programmers,"" he said.

Worries are mounting that risks from tightening restrictions in Europe to U.S. election uncertainty will snowball, pushing stocks over the edge in a repeat of February’s selloff. Strong gains at the start of October have given way to losses, and previous winners such as tech shares are signaling a shift in sentiment. The Stoxx 600 has already lost 2.7% this week and futures are signally another sharp drop today. After months of going nowhere, the momentum in the market is now to the downside. The proportion of stocks with MACD sell signal has been rising steadily this month and is highest since August. Instead of the V-shaped economic revival many had hoped for, the final months of the year may bring more turmoil.

In June, Honeywell announced a new partnership with SAP to help building managers automate aspects of their facilities. It also rolled-out an ultralight cleaning system to help airlines better sanitize planes in-between flights. Then, in August, the company was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average . Now, as Honeywell prepares to celebrate its 100th year as a publicly-traded company, Adamczyk has no plans to slow-down the firm's transformation from a manufacturing giant best-known for digital thermostats to a software powerhouse that can rival the offerings of firms like Salesforce. ""We're an industrial technology company that continues to stay relevant by anticipating the needs of our customers, anticipating where the world is going, and then investing in those technologies to make sure we capture that value,"" he told Business Insider. ""My personal goal is to continue to stay relevant, to continue to drive the transformation."" In just over three years at the helm of Honeywell, Adamczyk has left a lasting mark on the company, perhaps most notably by elevating Forge — the firm's software division — to its own business unit (it previously spanned different verticals, like aerospace and e-commerce, which elicited some confusion among employees as to their exact role within the company).",SAP,en,Business Insider

And now, with a confluence of factors fuelling humanity's turn away from meat - from the climate consciousness of a younger generation to the global Covid-19 pandemic - it looks as though firms throughout the food supply chain are racing to readjust their business models even more sharply towards a plant-based future. One organisation that has followed these developments closely is FAIRR, a network of investors focused on addressing the environmental risks linked to intensive livestock production. For the last four years, FAIRR has engaged with 25 giant global food retailers with combined annual revenues of $459bn, observing and encouraging their evolving experiments with meat-free protein alternatives.",SAP,en,BusinessGreen

Companies long resisted publishing individual compensation of top managers, whose pay is often a fraction of what many of their global peers receive. German chief executive officers rarely get more than €10 million ($11.2 million) annually. Volkswagen AG paid its CEO around €8 million last year, less than half the $22 million Mary Barra made at General Motors Co., even though VW’s sales are almost twice the size of GM’s. And on average, German leaders earn 97 times as much as employees, vs. 312 times as much at the biggest U.S. companies, according to the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. Yet a trio of German millennials could upend the status quo—and become Europe’s highest-paid executives in the process.
