2020-06-07 07:45:00-05:00,People are accusing fast-food giants like Wendy's and McDonald's of funding Trump's reelection. Here's what is really happening,"McDonald's, Wendy's, Taco Bell, and more chains were forced to deny viral claims on social media that they are donating to President Trump's reelection. No major fast-food chains or CEOs of prominent chains are donating to Trump in the 2020 election, according to a review of FEC data by Business Insider. PACs run by chains and PACs run by franchisees are donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to candidates for Congress, with chains typically donating more to Republicans than Democrats. The viral rumors started after Business Insider reported the CEO of an independent franchisee who owns Wendy's, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut locations donated more than $440,000 to Trump's campaign. A handful of wealthy industry insiders are also Trump donors, including Nelsen Peltz, who sits on Wendy's board; Stephen Ross, whose company has invested in smaller brands like &Pizza and Momofuku; and Tilman Fertitta, the CEO of Landry's, which owns Bubba Gump, Del Frisco's, and Joe's Crab Shack.

2019-05-13 08:00:00-05:00,Cannabis Legalization Persists as a Topic of Discussion all Over the World,"NEW YORK , May 13, 2019 /PRNewswire/ --The rapid proliferation of cannabis legalization throughout the North American region has led to the emergence of new products within the recreational and medical marketplaces alike. Aside from smoking cannabis through joints or pipes, consumers are now enjoying cannabis in a variety of ways, including edibles and extracts. Consequently, the shift towards different cannabis-based products led to a major decline in flower sales. For instance, Colorado began adult-use sales back in 2014 and flower sales accounted for 67% of the state's total revenue. However, four years later in 2018, flower sales sank and accounted for only 44%. During the same period, the concentrates market closed the gap, as its market share expanded from 15% to 31%, according to BDS Analytics. Now, the declining flower sales don't necessarily mean the cannabis market is retracting, rather, it signifies the emergence of innovation within the industry. On the other hand, segments such as the hemp market have made significant progress over the past year.",TAP,en,Benzinga
