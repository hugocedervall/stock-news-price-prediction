2020-03-17 16:07:36-05:00,"Stifel Sees Decent Volumes Near Term, 2Q In Jeopardy","While disruption to supply chains from the coronavirus may not be quantified for some time, first-quarter 2020 earnings results may not be as bad as feared. On a freight and supply chain update call with clients, Stifel Financial (NYSE: SF ) equity research analysts David Ross and Bruce Chan discussed how the recent surge in consumer demand, specifically retail and grocery, will likely prop up first-quarter earnings results for some transportation companies. Ross said the final two weeks in March, usually the most important of any first quarter, will still need to be strong for this thesis to play out. He said recent channel checks the firm has conducted with truckload (TL) and less-than-truckload (LTL) carriers have been positive and indicative of improved seasonal demand. Further, the surge in demand from consumers stocking up on food, grocery and other household items has resulted in stronger volumes for carriers. Outbound Tender Volume Index – SONAR: OTVI.USA Talking about the free fall in transportation stock prices, Ross noted that the ""economy wasn't that great before"" the outbreak.",SF,en,Benzinga Feeds
2020-03-16 14:41:09-05:00,Stifel Sees Supply Chain Disruption Through Summer,"Stifel Financial (NYSE: SF ) expects disruption from the coronavirus to ""persist into July, and possibly even longer,"" said the company in a Monday morning note to clients recapping a conference call it held Sunday on supply chain implications related to the outbreak. Equity research teams covering transportation and sports and lifestyle brands teamed up with industry executives in apparel and logistics to host the call. Stifel Financial provided its insights and the highlights from the call in the report. The report said shippers and service providers ""should expect higher costs and further delays"" throughout the transportation industry. ""As the initial disruption associated with Chinese production shutdowns clears, the future is even less certain: there are a wide range of outcomes depending upon how the U.S. demand picture develops. For now, shippers are well-advised to remain flexible and creative, and to seek out knowledgeable supply chain partners with scale and capacity relationships."" The conference call focused on supply chain disruptions, shortages of materials and textiles, spikes in freight costs, increased wait times on packed shipping lanes, and the expectation for increased use of air freight as manufacturers reposition inventory quickly.",SF,en,Benzinga Feeds
2020-03-12 16:48:34-05:00,"Cass Data Weak In February, Truckload Recovery Expectations Pushing Outward","Negative trends in the transportation markets continued in February, according to freight data released by payment management solutions provider, Cass Information Systems Inc . (NASDAQ: CASS ). The Cass Freight Index fell again in February as the shipments index declined 7.5% year-over-year (y/y) with the expenditures index declining 6.8% for the month. In January, the report's author and Stifel Financial (NYSE: SF ) equity research analyst David Ross was hopeful for a second quarter snapback as supply chains recovered from coronavirus-related disruption and import activity increased. A month later, that hope has somewhat diminished. ""This certainly puts some doubt around our view that the second quarter of 2020 could see actual y/y growth in domestic U.S. shipments and freight costs, as traditional seasonal freight patterns may not hold,"" stated Ross. ""We are hearing Chinese manufacturing activity is picking back up but at below-average levels. And then there is the issue of moving the goods produced out of the country and to the U.S., which may be limited by airfreight capacity, truck capacity, and/or container capacity."" The positives, so to speak, were that the y/y declines in February were less severe than those seen in January and that shipment volumes improved 6.2% sequentially from January, which was in line with recent historical seasonality trends.",SF,en,Benzinga Feeds

Cass Freight Index (Shipments) – SONAR: CFIS.USA From the report, ""The turn of the calendar didn't leave the bad news in 2019, as the Cass Freight Index showed continued weakness in the U.S. freight market. Both the shipments and expenditures components of the Cass Freight Index worsened sequentially and showed decelerating y/y growth,"" commented Stifel Financial 's (NYSE: SF ) equity research analyst and author of the report David Ross. However, Ross still holds onto the hope of a recovery in the second quarter of 2020. ""As stated last month, we expect 2Q20 to have the best chance of showing actual y/y growth in domestic U.S. shipments and freight costs, if traditional seasonal freight patterns hold, because 2Q19 was below average in terms of the seasonal surge in activity,"" Ross stated.",SF,en,Benzinga Feeds

""It wasn't the prettiest month for the Cass Index, which means it wasn't the best month in the freight world.

The shipments component of the index extended its round trip of year-over-year declines, first turning negative in December 2018. Further, shipment declines occurred at their steepest rate since the Great Recession in 2008-09 during December. Ross said that some of the ""industry participants"" he has talked with noted that even though December had the same number of operating days versus 2018, the midweek holidays resulted in ""soft volume and low productivity the last week or so."" The report attributed the general softness in freight demand to higher inventories and continued weakness in the manufacturing economy as seen in the recent Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) as well as rail carloads.",SF,en,Benzinga Feeds
