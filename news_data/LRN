2020-07-27 11:53:32-05:00,Why It's A Mistake to Assume There Will Be A Long Term Boost For Online Education Providers,"When everything from kindergarten to college went online this spring, pundits and investors alike predicted major upside for the companies that create and sell online learning products and services – companies such as Pearson plc (NYSE: PSO ), 2U Inc (NASDAQ: TWOU ), and K12 Inc. (NYSE: LRN ). For the most part, they have been right. The latter two of those stocks have more than tripled since March, as online learning demand has opened both doors and eyes. For investors, the short-term trade has worked out. But the long term picture doesn't look as rosey. In evaluating companies that provide education services to schools, the first rule is to remember the sales in education is long—often years long—and very complicated. It can even take as long to onboard a new customer/school as it did to win the deal in the first place. Solutions and business deals in this space flow like tectonic plates, nearly impervious to need or demand.
