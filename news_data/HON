And on Friday we’ll get earnings from Honeywell International and BNY Mellon. A summary of this week's reporters is below courtesy of Earnings Whispers: This week's earnings aside, Goldman's David Kostin over the weekend minimized the importance of Q3 earnings for the broader market, which he listed as third in order of importance behind a Covid vaccine and the elections. There is a reason why the Goldman strategist may want to minimize the importance of the next 4 weeks, because as he admits, the consequences of the semi-frozen economy on an uneven road to recovery will be visible in 3Q results: consensus expects 3Q S&P 500 EPS will decline by 21% on a year/year basis, following a 32% drop in 2Q and a 15% fall in 1Q.",HON,en,Zero Hedge

The market benchmark has a rich history embedded alongside America’s rise as a global superpower in the 20th century, and, as Visual Capitalis's Aran Ali details below, the inflows and outflows of companies on the 30 stock index coincide with broader secular trends. For example, the delisting of many industrial stocks over time encapsulates America’s transition towards a service-based economy. Meanwhile, the addition of tech companies in the last few decades paints a similar picture of change.

As DB's Jim Reid adds, there will also be some attention on the European Council summit on Thursday and Friday at an important point in the UK-EU negotiations. This meeting has previously been Prime Minister Johnson’s self-imposed deadline to reach agreement on a trade deal. It seems progress has been made and if this continues talks will likely continue beyond that self imposed UK deadline. Mr Johnson held weekend talks with Macron and Merkel so the right people are talking. Bloomberg is reporting that the French are digging in their heels over fishing rights and this is now the main issue. Elsewhere, in terms of the regular data and central bank calendar, this week is a fairly quiet one. On the data side, we’ll start to see some hard data from the US for September, with the release of the CPI (Tuesday), retail sales and industrial production figures (both Friday).",HON,en,Zero Hedge

Now, the pandemic has politicians vowing to take action.The Trump administration has talked about bringing supply chains home from China, and even publicly floated the need for a group of friendly nations in Asia that could help produce essential goods. President Donald Trump last month even said the U.S. would “save $500 billion” if it cut off ties with China.But interviews with nearly a dozen government officials and analysts in the Asia-Pacific region show that any broader effort to restructure supply chains is little more than wishful thinking so far. While governments are pushing to win investments, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s planned state-of-the-art semiconductor factory in the U.S., it won’t be simple to dismantle an entrenched system when many companies are struggling to survive.More likely is that the virus will accelerate a change that was already driven by market forces as rising wages and costs in China over the past decade caused an exodus of lower-value manufacturing, much of it to Southeast Asia.",HON,en,Economic Times India

2020-02-16 01:05:03-05:00,US weighs blocking GE engine sales for China’s new airplane : Sources,"PARIS: The U.S. government is considering whether to stop General Electric Co from continuing to supply engines for a new Chinese passenger jet, according to people familiar with the matter, casting uncertainty over China's efforts to enter the civil aviation market. The potential restriction on the engine sales - possibly along with limits on other components for Chinese commercial aircraft such as flight control systems made by Honeywell International Inc - is the latest move in the battle between the world's two largest economies over trade and technology. The issue is expected to come up at an interagency meeting about how strictly to limit exports of U.S. technology to China on Thursday and at another meeting with members of President Donald Trump's Cabinet set for Feb. 28, sources said. The White House and the U.S. Commerce Department, which issues licenses for such exports, declined to comment, as did a GE spokeswoman. The departments of Defense, State, Energy and Treasury did not respond to requests for comment.",HON,en,The Sun Daily

Given the ongoing 737 Max trouble faced by Boeing Co.

But despite high-profile headwinds, the industrial sector was actually nearly on-pace with the broad market through 2019, with the Industrial Select Sector Index (IXI) posting a 26% gain compared to the broad market’s 30% climb. Benefitting from this growth are ETFs that follow the index like the Direxion Daily Industrials Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: DUSL ), which closed out the year to hit new 52-week highs. Now, with most of the major industrial names having closed the books on 2019, the sector is hoping to carry that momentum into 2020.",HON,en,Benzinga Feeds

It’s kind of ironic to think a tiny virus could stop the market in its tracks, with sharp losses in pre-market trading Monday. It’s also surprising that just when a lot of people thought China would leave the front pages with the trade deal, another China issue starts ganging up on stocks and sending investors back into caution mode. Bonds rallied sharply early Monday, taking the 10-year Treasury yield down to a four-month low of 1.62% and also slamming crude prices. While you never want to overlook the unfortunate human impact of something like the coronavirus, it’s important to keep things in perspective. The virus could potentially get worse, but at this point there’s only a handful of U.S. cases and around 2,700 cases worldwide. Hopefully it gets contained and the market can go back to other things.

2019-08-19 10:23:25-05:00,Sweden recently introduced a gender-neutral pronoun. Psychologists say it's already changing the way people think.,"Sweden added a gender-neutral pronoun, hen , to its dictionary in 2012, and it's since become part of everyday usage. To find out how the word has affected Swedish culture , US scientists asked native Swedes to identify a stick figure with a gender pronoun, and most of them went gender-neutral with hen . The pronoun was largely associated with neutrality, while the English singular ""they/them,"" was associated with the masculine gender. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. Swedish people have had two gender pronouns for a long time: hon (she) and han (he). Then in 2012, along came hen. The gender-neutral pronoun has since become a regular part of Swedish life — and according to new psychological research , it's changing the way people think. How hen changed Sweden According to Adam Rogers at Wired , hen has become commonplace.

Wall Street investment portfolios are starting to look similar.

2019-07-19 08:17:17-05:00,We spoke with the president of Honeywell's enterprise software unit about the company's pivot to industrial software (HON),"Industrial giant Honeywell is leaning on its connected industrial software business to support growing organic sales — up 5% year-over-year (YoY) — and an increasing sales backlog — up over 10% YoY — which the company reported in its earnings yesterday.

CEO Darius Adamczyk said in the earnings release that the company is becoming ""a premier software-industrial company, with connected software sales continuing to grow at a double-digit rate organically. The HCE foundation is firmly in place, supported by the launch of Honeywell Forge, a comprehensive industrial IoT (IIoT) software solution.""

But in a sign that banks are still seriously exploring applications for blockchain technology despite the blowup in the prices of crypto tokens, JPM announced that it would be rolling out the first cryptocurrency launched by a US bank , according to CNBC . After banning the purchase of cryptocurrencies by its credit card customers last year, JPM said it will soon begin testing a stablecoin technology in its wholesale payments business now that its engineers have produced a finished product. The bank said ""JPM Coin"" will be used to offer instantaneous settlement for transactions in the bank's large corporate clients in its $6 trillion-a-day payments business for large corporations and institutions.
