The alarm was raised by research groups Amazon Watch and Stand.earth, who called oil extraction in the region “a gateway to deforestation and increased agricultural and industrial activity”. The banks that were reported to have backed the oil trade were accused of double standards, as all had made public environmental commitments, such as to the 2015 Paris climate accord, the United Nations sustainable development goals, and promises to protect forests. In the aftermath of the report, Swiss bank UBS and Netherlands-based Rabobank scrambled to state that they had stopped financing Amazonian oil, either wholly or in part, and Natixis and ING issued hasty pledges to “look into” the report’s findings.",RIO,en,InstitutionAlassetManager

A key part of the Paris Agreement encourages countries to agree on carbon trading systems in pursuit of climate change goals, and IETA's government council said it would push for governments and organisations to step up their climate ambitions to net zero by the middle of the century. ""IETA's work with governments around the world will emphasise the importance of accelerating work to make the 'net' operational so that 'net zero' is achievable,"" said Dirk Forrister, president and CEO of IETA. ""By this, we mean that policies should enable companies and sectors to cooperate through trading policies, including use of natural climate solutions and a wide range of technological removals."" ""International cooperation through markets will be essential for achieving net zero, because not every country has the same opportunities to reduce or remove greenhouse gases - while others have more opportunities than they need,"" he continued. ""The trading system envisioned in Article 6 [of the Paris Agreement] will bring these opportunities and needs together for mutual benefit of the countries involved - advancing the global goal."" IETA also this week released the results of its annual survey, revealing 71 per cent of its 137 members and 22 IATA (International Air Transport Association) have now set net zero pledges.",RIO,en,BusinessGreen

2019-07-26 12:10:41-05:00,"Customs dept cracks down on 'rough diamonds', industry cries foul","A packet of stones bearing the label ‘rough diamonds’ recently found its way to the customs department in Mumbai.It was part of a consignment for a city-based diamantaire, one of many similar packages. The accompanying shipping bill pegged its value as high as any high-yielding, rough-cut diamond lode. But the stones in this particular packet were quartz--they weren’t diamonds.It wasn’t a packing error, or a case of wrongful disclosure. What it represented, according to the customs department, was evidence of a scam that’s been brewing in the Indian diamond industry over the past few years.The trade, which imports roughs for polishing, acknowledges the presence of bad apples but allege that the customs department is harassing them indiscriminately. India processes close to 70 per cent of the world’s polished diamonds in terms of value and 92 per cent in terms of number of pieces.“There are a few dishonest diamantaires and they should be punished. But what’s the point harassing 7,000-odd genuine diamond traders?” said one trader who didn’t want to be named.The Mumbai customs crackdown began with an office note to all assessors clearing consignments of roughs in the first week of May.",RIO,en,The Economic Times India
