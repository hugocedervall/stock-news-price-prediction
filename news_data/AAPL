2020-12-08 15:05:51.000,Companies are scrambling to prepare for Apple's upcoming app privacy changes. Here's what we know so far. (AAPL),"Summary List Placement Apple threw a wrench into the mobile-app ad industry in June when it announced a major privacy update that will require app developers to get permission from iPhone users to track them, and the rumor swirling is that Apple — after postponing the launch date in September — is preparing for a March rollout, multiple sources told Business Insider. The industry assumption is that most users will opt out from being tracked — which will prevent mobile advertisers, developers, adtech companies from accessing Apple's Identifier for Advertisers (known as the IDFA) in order to target users with ads and measure the effectiveness of those campaigns. Analysts from Arete Research estimated the change could wipe out $40 billion in mobile app ad spending, affecting companies ranging from tech giants including Facebook, Snap and Twitter to game developers and publishers. Some companies and organizations, including Facebook, are loudly complaining about the potential fallout and saying Apple isn't applying the same strict privacy standards to its own apps and services.",AAPL,en,Business Insider

The protocol, dubbed ""Oblivious DNS-over-HTTPS,"" or ""ODoH,"" makes it more difficult for internet service providers to know which websites users have visited. When visiting a website, browsers use a DNS resolver to convert web addresses into machine-readable IP addresses to locate where the page is located. However, this is an unencrypted process and ISPs can see the DNS query and conclude which websites their users have visited. Internet service providers are also able to sell this information to advertisers. Innovations such as DNS-over-HTTPS, or DoH, have added encryption to DNS queries. While this may dissuade bad actors who may wish to hijack DNS queries to point victims to malicious websites, DNS resolvers are still able to see which websites are being visited.

The best thing Samsung ever did to conquer the mobile market was to blatantly copy the iPhone . It’s what allowed its Android phones to grow in popularity in the first years when Galaxy S devices looked and felt like iPhone lookalikes. The lawsuits that followed forced Samsung to refine smartphone design and software further and find its own voice. But by the time it happened, Samsung was already at the top of the mobile industry.

President Trump in August signed an executive order that would officially ban any U.S. transactions with TikTok if its Chinese parent ByteDance did not reach a deal to divest it to a U.S. company.

This will allow investors and traders to directly access the listed companies without an external broker or additional fees. The popular stocks available to purchase and trade on Bittrex include Tesla (TSLA), Alibaba (BABA), SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), Beyond Meat Inc (BYND), Pfizer (PFE), Apple (AAPL), BioNTech (BNTX), Google (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Bilibili (BILI). These stocks will be tradeable against US dollars (USD), Tether (USDT), and Bitcoin (BTC). “The traditional stock exchanges of the world’s financial capitals have for centuries set the terms for engagement and trading,” said Tom Albright, the chief executive of Bittrex Global adding that the decade-old inefficient, complex, and expensive infrastructure is “totally unnecessary.” He said, “Blockchain technology has the potential to radically broaden access to financial services, and Bittrex Global is very proud to provide people with a portal to build their capital and private wealth in a way that was unimaginable a decade ago.” Unlike the traditional stock market, Bittrex will allow people to trade twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.","AMZN,AAPL",en,BitcoinExchangeGuide

The report makes a compelling argument, based on a range of industry trends, aggregated data, and existing infrastructure, that Apple is in a prime position to launch an all-in-one hardware and software subscription. Similar to the iPhone upgrade program, we believe, over time, Apple's delightful hardware trade-in experience for Mac, iPad , and Watch will evolve into hardware subscription offerings for these devices. Eventually, we envision the company merging its services offerings, alongside hardware subscriptions, to create a 360° bundle. Think of this as paying a monthly fee to Apple for most of your tech needs. The conclusion is partly based upon industry macro trends, including ""an ongoing digital transformation"" and ""changing consumer buying preferences."" This is supported by the fact that Apple is said to be the only company that could create such a subscription, given its service and maintenance logistics, as well as its unique hardware and software integration.",AAPL,en,Mac Rumors

Those differences have never been more clear than the current tension between the two companies over Apple's decision to require apps to obtain permission before tracking and collecting user data for the purpose of advertising. You can argue over which of the two companies provides a better experience for users, but ultimately, you can't have what Facebook calls ""personalized experiences"" and still maintain the level of user privacy that Apple says is its core value . You only get one by giving up at least part of the other. Apple's latest effort to improve user privacy on its devices, known as App Tracking Transparency (ATT), is a part of iOS 14 — and it has very real implications for advertisers . That explains why Facebook is concerned. As the second largest advertising platform in the world, Facebook has said that ATT could ""render Audience Network so ineffective on iOS 14 that it may not make sense to offer it on iOS 14.""

Subscribe today to receive industry-changing health news and analysis to your inbox. The coronavirus pandemic has been a watershed moment for telehealth — or the use of mobile technology to deliver health-related services, such as remote doctor consultations and patient monitoring — as patients have had to reimagine the ways they seek healthcare. While telehealth has been on the brink of taking off for years, consumer usage of the tech ticked up slowly before 2020. The coronavirus pandemic has given consumers the push they need to adopt telemedicine on a wide scale — and we expect adoption to keep climbing so long as the pandemic rages on. Once outbreaks became severe in the US, consumers began flocking to telehealth: Telehealth usage among US adults climbed 6 percentage points month-over-month from February 2020 — when 11% of respondents reported having tried telehealth — to March — when 17% said the same, per a survey by CivicScience.","AAPL,VERX",en,Business Insider

Image via ColorWare The patent application, filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, is titled "" Anodized Part Having a Matte Black Appearance ,"" and outlines the characteristics of the finish and possible manufacturing processes to achieve it. The patent notes that the finish can be used on a range of metals and metal alloys, including aluminum, titanium, and steel. The finish comprises an anodized layer that includes ""randomly distributed light-absorbing features that are capable of absorbing visible light."" The layer contains pores, ""where color particles are infused within the pores."" The resulting surface is a deep, intense matte black. A genuine black color is extremely difficult to achieve, with most commercial ""black"" products actually being dark gray or blue. The patent explains that ""merely depositing dye particles within pores of an anodized layer is insufficient to impart a true black color."" One of the issues involved is that, generally, the truer the black, the higher the gloss of the finish, which in turn reflects a large amount of visible light.",AAPL,en,Mac Rumors

Beer revealed the stunning exploit on Tuesday in a 30,000-word blog post , which shows in detail how a memory corruption bug in AWDL could give attackers remote access to a user's personal data, including emails, photos, messages, and passwords and crypto keys stored in the keychain. The vulnerability was discovered by Beer in a 2018 iOS beta that Apple accidentally shipped without stripping function name symbols from the kernelcache, offering a wealth of missing context about how bits of code fit together.

It needs to get better. Here are some ways that might happen. What developers can do Though iOS app developers with the Apple silicon Developer Transition Kit could build their iOS apps for Mac and run them to get an idea how they’d perform on macOS, I understand that many developers didn’t do this, and others didn’t feel comfortable letting their iOS apps out into the wild without first giving them a try on a real M1 Mac.

Applications to the quality control agency, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), typically used to be processed within 15 days, but some are now taking up to two months or longer. BIS started delaying approvals in August for China-made imports of devices like smartphones, smartwatches and laptops, part of the fallout from deteriorating ties with China after a border clash in June that left 20 Indian soldiers dead.

The goal was to build a system that could track individual interactions across an entire population, in an effort to get a head start on isolating potentially infectious carriers of a disease that, as the world was discovering, could be spread by asymptomatic patients. Delivered at breakneck pace, the resulting exposure notification tool has yet to prove its worth. The NHS Covid-19 app uses it, as do others around the world.

But what are they long? The tautological answer is ""the basket of Hedge Fund VIP stocks"", which is the 50 or so names that most hedge funds have gravitated toward, and which as noted earlier, managed to outperform remarkably in Q3. The only problem: the basket of most popular hedge fund shorts ripped even higher in 2020… ... which is why this has been another year in which hedge funds have failed to outperform the S&P500. Looking closer at this VIP basket reveals that it is nothing more than a handful of momentum/tech names that trade with near record equity duration, which is why they are so sensitive to even the faintest gust of reflation as we saw last Monday when the momentum factor suffered a 15 sigma collapse. This is how Goldman explains the recent turmoil within this ""most popular"" group of stocks: Recent vaccine developments have generated a major shift in equity market momentum and also a stumbling block for hedge fund alpha.",AAPL,en,Zero Hedge

2020-11-20 18:40:20.000,"Apple's move to cut App Store commissions in half for small developers is a start, but it mostly misses the real point","Summary List Placement On Wednesday, Apple announced a new program that lets smaller iOS developers apply to have the commission they pay on App Store transactions reduced from 30% to 15% . The change applies to developers who generate less than $1 million in total revenue in a year beginning January 1, 2021. In a statement , Apple said the reason for launching the program is to ""support small and individual developers and spur innovation for the next chapter of apps."" There's actually a lot to unpack here considering that, according to Sensor Tower, the change could affect as many as 98% of iOS developers . At the same time, those developers represent only 5% of total App Store transactions. As The New York Times points out, the move will have little effect on Apple's profit margin , amounting to less than 2.5% of App Store revenue. Still, I don't think the numbers are necessarily the best way to evaluate this change. I think it's fair to say that Apple, in addition to finding a way to support small developers, has also found what it thinks is a way to relieve some of the pressure it's faced over how it manages the App Store.",AAPL,en,Business Insider

2020-11-20 12:29:45.000,First HomePod Jailbreak Stokes Speculation About Smart Speaker's Hacking Potential,"The team behind the "" Checkra1n "" jailbreaking tool for iOS claims to have used it to successfully jailbreak Apple's HomePod , although it's unclear what that could mean for the smart speaker in terms of hacking potential. The news was announced by Twitter user L1ngL1ng , who shared a screenshot of a macOS Terminal window that appears to show command line root access to the ‌HomePod‌ over a secure shell (SSH) connection. The command line grab suggests the device in question is an original 2018 ‌HomePod‌ model (with the identifier AudioAccessory 1,1) rather than Apple's new HomePod mini (AudioAccessory 5,1). The original ‌HomePod‌ runs on an Apple-designed A8 chip, which is the same chip that was first introduced with the iPhone 6. The development is a novel one indeed, but the practical utility of jailbreaking a ‌HomePod‌ is largely unknown, although that hasn't stopped commenters on the r/jailbreak subreddit from speculating on the possibilities. Hello Homepod, meet checkra1n.

2020-11-20 11:50:28.000,Google’s iMessage rival is finally getting end-to-end encryption,"Google announced that the Messages app is available worldwide, bringing RCS texting in markets that did not support it before. Messages is Google’s latest answer to Apple’s iMessage, offering almost the same suite of features. One notable difference concerns the end-to-end encryption, which is not available on Android. But Google says that it will start rolling it out in beta form this year. iMessage is one of the best products Apple came up with since the introduction of the iPhone, a rich chat platform that replaced SMS messaging years ago. iMessage comes with end-to-end encryption that makes it impossible for anyone to access chat data, and works on all of Apple’s devices, including the iPad and Mac. iMessage doesn’t have Android support, and Google has been trying for years to create a compelling alternative. After many failures, Google finally launched its RCS messaging system that’s the closest Android has to an iMessage rival. RCS is supported by carriers, replaces regular text messaging, and comes with various features seen in iMessage and other popular instant messengers.",AAPL,en,BGR

The compact dock, which weighs in at a pound (0.5 kg), provides ready access to useful jacks, while offering a solid design contrast that doesn’t imitate Apple’s aesthetic. The $259.99 price is right in line with the array of options. The TBT100 has five high-speed data ports: two USB Type-A SuperSpeed (3.2 Gen 1 or 5 Gbps), two USB Type-C SuperSpeed+ (3.2 Gen 2 or 10 Gbps), and one Thunderbolt 3. That Thunderbolt 3 port, however, is reserved to connect to a Mac, as the 40Gbps throughput is necessary to power all the peripherals. It also provides up to 85 watts to power an attached laptop, removing the need for the laptop to have a separately connection to power. (The dock also supports Windows systems with Thunderbolt 3.)

With the launch of iOS 14 , users quickly discovered that Shortcuts could be used to replace traditional app icons to create an entirely customized ‌Home Screen‌ look. Unfortunately, while these Home Screens created with Shortcuts looked fantastic, the experience was less than ideal because launching an app through shortcuts required the Shortcuts app to open briefly, slowing the app opening process. In iOS 14.3 beta 2 , that's no longer the case because shortcuts no longer have to route through the Shortcuts app. As Reddit users discovered after installing yesterday's beta, launching an app through Shortcuts on the ‌Home Screen‌ in iOS 14.3 pops up a banner at the top of the display, but the full Shortcuts app no longer opens, so there's less of a delay when using a custom icon to launch apps.

The M1 is the silver chip labeled with APL1102, housing the 8-core CPU, 8-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine, I/O controllers, and more all in one. The unified system memory is also visible on the right side of the chip, and takes up far less space than the standalone RAM modules used in the previous Mac mini, contributing to the smaller logic board. As expected, the switch to unified system memory also means that there is no user-upgradeable RAM, as there was with the previous Mac mini, so choose wisely between 8GB or 16GB of memory when configuring the Mac mini on Apple's online store.

As some users undoubtedly found with the original HomePod , it's not possible to AirPlay to multiple speakers from the menu bar on a Mac. The inability to select stereo-paired ‌HomePod‌ speakers as your Mac audio output device is a glaring omission in Apple's ‌AirPlay‌ rollout, and the situation unfortunately remains the same in macOS 11 Big Sur. You can only use them with certain Apple apps like Music and TV – all other Mac audio must be output to one speaker or the other, but not both at the same time. While it's frustrating that Apple's own apps let users select stereo-paired HomePods as a single device, this does provide a workaround, although it's kludge that has its drawbacks. The following steps show you how it's done. Launch the Music app on your Mac and select your stereo-paired ‌HomePod‌ minis as the audio output. Now, minimize the Music app (don't close it), then launch the Audio MIDI Setup app located in the Applications -> Utilities folder.",AAPL,en,Mac Rumors
