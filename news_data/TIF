Now the enclave is the most expensive area in the Hamptons, the string of quaint Long Island beach towns beloved by wealthy New Yorkers. Indeed, the petite village boasts the second-priciest ZIP code in America , according to a November report by real-estate statistics site Property Shark. Meisel, an art dealer and collector, spends most of each year in Sagaponack, chockablock with mansions separated by acres of farmland. The nation's runner-up in property values — to only the tony Silicon Valley suburb of Atherton, California — 11962 notched a median home price of $3.875 million. But in 1984, Meisel and his wife Susan nabbed a 5,000-square-foot, six-bedroom house in Sagaponack — for just $475,000. And after scouring the Hamptons for the right property, they found their Xanadu.

Der riesige gelbe Diamant, der in dem Hollywood-Streifen zu sehen ist, wog bei seiner Entdeckung in der südafrikanischen Kimberley-Mine im Jahr 1877 satte 287,42 Karat – und ist somit bis heute einer der größten jemals gefundenen gelben Diamanten. Charles Lewis Tiffany, Gründer von Tiffany & Co., kaufte die Rarität und ließ sie zu einem 128,54-karätigen Edelstein im Kissenschliff umarbeiten.

Kamal previously told Business Insider that it's now up to consumers to define what luxury means, and to find fashion houses that align with their personal values. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. Saying the word ""luxury"" is now a faux pas — at least according to some in the industry. Alexandre Arnault , the 27-year-old CEO of high-end luggage company Rimowa and son of billionaire LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault , said at a Goldman Sachs event that he's reluctant to use the word ""luxury"" to describe his brand. In the younger Arnault's view, the word luxury is ""too linked to price"" and the luxury sector has more to do with ""quality"" than it does with ""price."" ""When you think luxury, you think stores where you're going to have things you can't afford, and you're going to be scared to go inside and everything, and, to me, when you buy a Vuitton bag for $4,000, it's a lot of money, it's a luxury product,"" he said at the event, as reported by Women's Wear Daily's Sindhu Sundar . ""Those products, whether it's a $40 bottle of champagne, the $1,000 Rimowa suitcase, or the million-dollar Tiffany necklace or whatever , are made with the same level of craftsmanship, of quality, of all the things that make those products desirable,"" he continued. ""And I don't think price should really come into the equation."" Bernard Arnault and his family, per Forbes' latest estimate , are worth about $102.4 billion.",TIF,en,Business Insider

On its way to amassing more than a billion users, Instagram has become many things: a joyful storehouse of family photos, a sledgehammer for celebrity tabloid culture, a shadowy abyss of teen bullying. Oh, and it has also become the most powerful force in shaping commerce this side of Amazon.com.The smartphone app has notably served as a platform for new forms of consumer marketing. But its influence on spending is far more profound. Because everyone now lives their lives on camera, Instagram has played a crucial role in altering both the look and nature of products people buy and the physical spaces where they shop.Certain items were elevated to the must-have list this decade because they were shareable — that is, they photographed especially well or had a flair of whimsy that racked up the likes and comments.",TIF,en,The Economic Times India

2019-01-04 20:25:44-05:00,"""A Tectonic Shift In China's Economy Has Largely Gone Unnoticed By Investors""","Back in August 2 we reported of a historic event for China's economy : for the first time in its modern history, China's current account balance for the first half of the year had turned into a deficit. And while the full year amount was likely set to revert back to a modest surplus, it was only a matter of time before one of the most unique features of China's economy - its chronic current account surplus - was gone for good. The back in November, as part of its summary of Top Macro Trades for 2019, UBS wrote that the upcoming loss of China's current account cushion, softening domestic activity, and upcoming tariffs mean that ""for the first time in 25 years, China would have to make a choice between external stability and growth."" Now it is the Wall Street's Journal 's turn to bring attention to this topic, calling it a ""tectonic shift"" in China's economy, which has largely gone unnoticed by investors, and which is ""quietly beginning to upend the global financial system."" A key driver behind China's declining current account is that after having long been the world’s heavyweight saver and a huge buyer of foreign assets like Treasurys, the world's most populous nation is now a big spender, and in early 2018, China got more of its growth from consumption than the U.S., the global king of consumer spending where some 70% of economic growth is due to consumer spending.",TIF,en,Zero Hedge
