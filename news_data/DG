Popshelf represents Dollar General's latest push to redefine itself and emerge as a retail powerhouse. The company has also doubled down on fresh grocery sales via its flagship chain, an expensive departure from its dollar store roots. Throughout this period of change, Dollar General has continued to thrive during the coronavirus pandemic , as economic woes push shoppers to seek out low prices. Business Insider spoke with the company's chief merchandising officer Emily Taylor about the new concept. She said Popshelf will focus on discretionary categories like home decor, housewares, party supplies, seasonal and holiday items, arts and crafts, and toys. Taylor said that the concept's target customer is slightly younger than the average Dollar General shopper. Popshelf's core demographic is also likely to skew more suburban and higher income than its dollar store counterpart. ""We embarked on a lot of customer research to determine if there was an opportunity,"" Taylor told Business Insider.

But now and for the past hundred or so years, this bucolic wedge of New York countryside relies on tourism.

While government support has sent indices and investment grade assets soaring, high yield and off-benchmark assets remain dislocated, underpricing the potential for a recovery, said portfolio manager Alberto Gallo, Algebris’ head of macro strategies. In a note this week, Gallo – who runs the Algebris Macro Credit Fund – pointed to a wealth of credit opportunities across financials and non-financials. “We still believe this is the right time to invest, and that strategies with an active and selective approach across sectors and special situations should outperform passive beta,” he wrote.
