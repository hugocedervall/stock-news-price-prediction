JPMorgan announced on Thursday it had entered into an agreement with New York-based Affinity Capital Exchange (ACE), a venue for companies looking to secure debt financing via points programs like frequent-flyer miles. As a result of the deal, JPMorgan's clients will have access to a standardized way to turn their loyalty programs into capital. While companies have been able to leverage these programs for cash in the past, the process is far from streamlined, Andreas Pierroutsakos, a managing director at JPMorgan, told Business Insider.

Six years following its 2014 groundbreaking, the airport just opened the first part of the new terminal to the public on September 15. Delta Air Lines passengers were among the first to use the new facility - complete with a new SkyClub - as the carrier is the largest at the airport. With Delta accounting for around 70% of the airport's daily departures, it's no surprise that the new terminal layout resembles that of other Delta hubs in Detroit and Atlanta. Two parallel east-west concourses aim to replace the airport's current pier layout where concourses radiate from a central terminal, allowing for more gates and less congestion in between concourses.

The airline said on Monday that it would raise $6.5 billion in loans backed by its SkyMiles program in a private notes offering. Airlines have raised cash through the pandemic largely by offering physical assets like aircraft as collateral, as well as airline business assets such as slots, routes, and airport gates. For US airlines, however, frequent flyer programs, with valuations in the tens of billions of dollars , offer another lifeline. While airlines frame their frequent flyer programs — fairly, in many cases — as being valuable for passengers, the rewards programs earn significantly more for airlines than they cost them. Airlines make billions per year by selling frequent-flyer miles to their credit-card partners. In turn, the credit card companies issue them to cardholders as spending rewards. For example, American Express, which issues co-branded credit cards with Delta, purchases the airline's miles and issues them to customers as a reward for spending, typically at a rate of 1-2 miles per dollar spent on the relevant credit card.",DAL,en,Business Insider

The redesign came after two incidents in which an engine unexpectedly shut down in the middle of a flight, after drinks were spilled onto that control panel. The cupholders in the Airbus A350 are smaller than those found in other planes, and pilots have tended to use the center console as a makeshift table for their drinks. And as anyone who's nursed a hot beverage while flying must know, putting a cup on a flat surface in midair is a good way to prompt a spill.

Insider Intelligence analyzes this industry and several others to provide in-depth analyst reports, proprietary forecasts, customizable charts, and more. Learn more about what we offer. The travel industry is one of the hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic and our new forecasts show that US digital travel sales will fall nearly 45% this year to $115.27 billion, which is about $93 billion less than last year's total.

Since the earliest days of the Jiang Zemin era, which saw China transform into an industrialized superpower, Beijing has facetiously talked a good game on economic and political liberalization, but only as a ruse to mollify the West, allowing corporate interests to cement China's status as a critical component of the global financial and trade system, even if its currency, the yuan, has yet to truly take off as an international currency. Perhaps inspired by President Trump's aggression, Beijing has officially dumped these pretenses as President Xi moves to crack down on widespread political dissent in Hong Kong. And in keeping with this newfound posture of aggression, one of China's most senior foreign policy officials - Foreign Minister Wang Yi - warned on Sunday that the US and its allies should abandon their ""wishful thinking"" about liberalizing China, while threatening to respond with violence should any foreign government interfere with China's assertions of sovereignty in Hong Kong and Taiwan, a de facto independent state that Beijing nonetheless views as a rebellious province.

But a deeper dive into Warren Buffett's stocks reveals a more complicated picture, not to mention a portfolio that has undergone quite a few significant changes of late. Most notably, Berkshire exited its investments in each of the four major U.S. airlines. The coronavirus pandemic, which put an end to the bull market, also decimated the airline industry. Buffett said as recently as March that he ""won't be selling airline stocks,"" but in early May, Berkshire turned tail, disclosing in filings that it closed out its stakes in United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV). Berkshire Hathaway held positions in 43 separate companies (across 46 different stocks thanks to firms with multiple share classes) as of the end of 2019, down significantly from 49 during the fourth quarter.",DAL,en,Kiplinger Washington Editors

According to the just filed Berkshire 13F , in the first quarter when the conglomerate's equity holdings took a record hit of $66.5 billion, as the value of Berkshire's disclosed equity positions tumbled from $242BN as of Dec 31, to $175.5BN on March 31, Buffett also sold the bulk, or 84%, of his Goldman Sachs stake - formerly a top 20 position for Berkshire - selling 10 million shares of what at Dec 31 was a 12 million position, while trimming 3% of his stake in JPMorgan (from 59.5MM to 57.7MM shares). Buffett's sale of Goldman, which at one point plunged as much as 33% in the first quarter, was uncharacteristic for an investor who not only has been a big investor in banks in the past (selling, if anything, to keep the stakes below the 10% ""active investor"" level scrutinized by regulators), but also represents a U-turn from a company that Berkshire bailed out during the financial crisis with a costly $5 billion investment in the form of perpetual preferred stock that carried a 10% dividend.",DAL,en,Zero Hedge

Note that face ID will be used for all air travelers and that all use of physical ID credentials is “phasing out” in favor of facial recognition and digital tokens on mobile devices. Driving the dystopian trend called out in the ACLU white paper is the malign convergence of interest between governments that want to use facial recognition and other techniques of compelled and automated identification for surveillance and control of travelers’ movements, and airlines, airports, and other businesses that want to share use of the same identification systems and data for business process automation and commercial tracking and profiling of travel customers.",DAL,en,Zero Hedge

No decision has been made, he said, and the airline would consider a competing midrange jetliner if Boeing decides to build one.Airbus has “pushed us hard since the day we started flying Boeing aircraft, and of course with the current problems, they’ve pushed us harder,” Singh said in an interview at Bloomberg’s headquarters in New York. “They have made us a commercial offer and we are evaluating it.”The discussions with Airbus threaten Boeing with a high-profile defection at a time when the U.S. planemaker is enmeshed in one of the biggest crises in its 103-year history. SpiceJet, India’s second-largest airline, has 13 Max jets already in its fleet and has committed to buy as many as 205 of the single-aisle workhorses as it expands capacity to handle the nation’s fast-growing demand for air travel.While Singh didn’t specify the exact size of a potential transaction, he said “any aircraft order that SpiceJet places would at least be 100 aircraft.” That would value the deal in excess of $13 billion, based on 2018 list prices before customary discounts for the A321neo.",DAL,en,The Economic Times India

2019-05-09 03:00:04-05:00,The Corporate World Has Its Own Inequality Problem,"(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- Liberals have a blind spot about inequality. They decry disparity between individuals—the fact, for example, that the 10 richest people in America have more money than the bottom 160 million. But they overlook inequality among companies, instead viewing Big Business as a troublesome monolith. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont occasionally tarred business with a broad brush, once saying the chiefs of large multinational companies “ain’t going to like me.” The surprising truth is there’s as much inequality among large companies as there is among people. As with individuals, a handful of companies make the lion’s share of profits, while struggling companies do so poorly they actually destroy value for their shareholders and debtholders. In the middle is a stressed-out majority: unable to keep up with the best, while pressured by the desperate tactics of the worst. Inequality in the corporate world isn’t new. Perfect competition—with millions of small, roughly equal businesses battling it out on a level playing field—was never more than a teaching device in intro economics textbooks.","DAL,CVS",en,Bloomberg
