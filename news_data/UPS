2020-12-08 10:10:23-05:00,3 COVID Stocks Not To Neglect,"There are now over 60 million COVID-19 cases worldwide, and they're continuing to rise. Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ) and Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA ) gave the world hope as their candidates showed 90% efficacy. But, besides these pharma stars, there are many other COVID-19 stocks that shouldn't be neglected. Uncovering a new opportunity The impending release of the above vaccines has created an abundant opportunity for companies that supply ultra-low temperature freezers as well as those which will ship them across the globe. Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE: TMO ) and United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS ) are up to the task. Freezers Demand for freezers could be through the roof as Pfizer's vaccine needs to be stored at negative 70 degrees Celsius, which is South Pole-like temperature, unlike Moderna's vaccine that requires a regular freezer at 20 degrees Celsius. Thermo Fisher's ULT freezers can accommodate both, as they can reach temperatures as low as negative 80 degrees Celsius. The created demand for these freezers will likely result into an improved top and bottom line for the healthcare company which is already a solid investment on its own merits.",UPS,en,Benzinga

More than a month later, Pfizer and Moderna have revealed that they remain in close contact with the Biden team. As it turns out, Biden may have been briefed on the initial Pfizer and Moderna data before President Trump, even though, at that point, Biden's victory had been decided by the media, and the media alone, STAT News reports. Now, both Pfizer and Moderna are skipping a White House vaccine summit, despite taking billions in taxpayer dollars for their vaccines. Unlike Moderna, which benefited directly from ""Operation Warp Speed"" funds, Pfizer self-financed the development of the vaccine, before striking a deal with OWS to supply the US with millions of doses.",UPS,en,Zero Hedge

Pfizer announced that its COVID-19 vaccine, which is in the late stages of clinical trials, has proven to be effective. The company is expected to file for emergency FDA clearance in the coming weeks. On Monday, Moderna announced it would file for emergency-use authorization of its vaccine, meaning its solution could reach large numbers of people in the coming weeks. While the vaccines appear to be safe and effective, there are major challenges ahead. Pfizer says two doses are required for each person, and the vaccines must be stored at - 94 degrees Fahrenheit, or -70 Celsius. Moderna's version must be stored at -4 degrees Fahrenheit, or -20 Celsius.

Between becoming the first company to launch an autonomous ride-hailing service in the US and landing partnerships with automakers like Fiat Chrysler and Daimler, the Google spinoff has rolled by a number of milestones in recent years. But staying ahead requires top talent, and in a hotly contested space, that often means paying top dollar. Business Insider looked at data the company shared with the US government to get a sense of how much it pays its employees. The US Office of Foreign Labor Certification requires companies to disclose compensation for permanent and temporary employees from outside the US to ensure the firms aren't paying them less than the average wage earned by their peers. The data Business Insider analyzed is from 2020 and represents an average among some of the employees included in Waymo's disclosures.

Unexpected costs and bottlenecks in charging infrastructure, fleet operations and maintenance, and permitting and financing weigh on cities and states mandating electric bus fleets, or private companies with large-scale delivery truck electrification goals. Solving for this “total cost of electrification” equation will be a critical step in pushing EV trucks and buses from the margins to the mainstream in the coming decade, according to a report released Wednesday by Environmental Defense Fund, MJ Bradley and Vivid Economics. “We’re seeing the technology increasingly ready, and capital increasingly eager to invest in sustainability” via fleet electrification, Andy Darrell, EDF’s chief of global energy and finance strategy, said in an interview. “And yet the deployment, especially in the medium and heavy-duty sector, might not be moving as quickly as we’d like to achieve big climate goals.” Estimates on the global market for electric trucks and buses range into the tens of billions of dollars over the coming decade, he noted.",UPS,en,Green Technology Media

That may be why venture capitalists see potential in autonomous-vehicle startups that are focused on applications, like trucking and mining, that present fewer technological challenges than ride-hailing. Business Insider asked seven venture capitalists to pick the two autonomous-vehicle startups they believe have the most promise, with the caveat that only one could be a company their firm has invested in. Their selections reflected the industry's increasing focus on business models that present a quicker path to commercialization than robotaxis and consumer cars. These 10 startups could play a major role in that pivot.

The additional Boeing 767 freighters will expand Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) fleet beyond 80 aircraft by the end of 2021, and a new report from researchers at DePaul University in Chicago estimates Amazon Air could have about 200 aircraft at its disposal in seven to eight years.

When Shyp started out in 2013, it catered to consumers who wanted to avoid schlepping to the post office. Instead, they could snap a photo of items they needed to be shipped with their smartphone, whereupon a Shyp courier would pick up the goods and take them to a Shyp warehouse for packing and handoff to UPS, FedEx, or the USPS.

It coincided with Amazon building out its shipping network and utilizing the warehouse robots it inherited after acquiring Kiva Systems for $775 million in 2012. Glick remembers when all of Amazon's packages were prepped for pickup by one of the big parcel carriers. Fulfillment and routing information was plotted on spreadsheets.

The UPS employees are accused of helping smuggle huge volumes of drugs vaping oils from Mexico into the U.S., exploiting a vulnerability in the UPS distribution system. This drug-trafficking operation reportedly was done by erasing the origin and destination of drug parcels and using UPS trucks to deliver them – circumventing security measures set in place to intercept drugs in the distribution network.

Currently, shipments up to 70 pounds are exempt from the surcharge. The changes take effect when the carriers' 2020 rates kick in, which will be Dec. 29 for UPS and Jan. 6 for FedEx.

A number of companies in the logistics space — both major players and niche startups — are formulating solutions: Amazon has struck numerous patents that would assist with drone package dropoffs. The e-tailer has been awarded a patent for a system that enables drones to recognize and avoid objects in a yard that might get in the way of a falling package. The firm has also been awarded a patent for a technology that enables drones to recognize human movements, which could be used to drop parcels directly to humans, for example.",UPS,en,Business Insider

Outside of the US Postal Service (USPS), FedEx and UPS have dominated the domestic logistics industry — and in particular, the last-mile of the delivery — for decades. On a quarterly earnings call in 2016, FedEx estimated that itself, UPS, and USPS executed a whopping 95% of all e-commerce orders. But rapidly rising volumes have put the pair of legacy shippers in a bind. E-commerce sales have risen over 50% and are projected to continue their ascent into the next decade. High volumes are already straining shippers' networks — UPS struggled to bring consumers their parcels on time due to higher-than-anticipated package volume, which upset some big-name retail partners, including Macy's, Walmart, and Amazon.

This cuts the drone delivery time of crucial medical specimen from half an hour to just over three minutes.

Amazon , which has made highly-publicized moves into drone testing, was not included in the program. Moving medical samples around WakeMed Raleigh's sprawling medical campus can sometimes take up to 30 minutes in traffic. That can be challenging when the material being moved is life-saving specimen like blood or organ samples.
