Purchase this report. Business Insider Intelligence offers even more consumer coverage with Payments & Commerce Pro. Subscribe today to receive industry-changing payments and commerce news and analysis to your inbox. Payments firms have introduced buy buttons to streamline the online checkout process, but so many have done so that it can have the opposite effect. This led companies to introduce buy buttons so consumers could skip the cumbersome, labor-intensive steps required to input contact and payment information online, and to allow them to shop online more freely. But the array of options has become overwhelming. Firms such as Mastercard, Visa, Apple, Amazon, Walmart, point-of-sale (POS) financing providers, and many more have developed buy buttons for their payment methods.
