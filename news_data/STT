The US Vegan Climate exchange-traded fund had the goal of becoming a sustainable alternative to the S&P 500 that was both cruelty-free and climate-conscious.

One of the un intended consequences of this near-extinction of market bears is that financial companies that traditionally make money from lending out shares to shorts are hurting, badly, as the collapse in short has resulted in a sharp revenue drop for those asset managers and brokers who mediate such trades.

The yen has long been among the assets in greatest demand during disasters, when waves of overseas-held capital traditionally flee back to Japan, pushing the currency higher. And for more than two decades, the trend has held. Since 1997, a 5% fall in the US S&P500 index was accompanied 76% of the time by yen appreciation, according to a study by Nordea. In mid-March, when the pandemic shock was at its height, that didn't happen. US equities tumbled 9% and 15% in successive weeks but the yen fell too. In subsequent selloffs, including this month's 4% equity slump, the currency has barely budged. ""The correlation with stocks didn't hold during the corona crisis, which is a game changer as to how everyone looks at the yen,"" Andreas Steno Larsen, chief global FX strategist at Nordea Markets, said.",STT,en,The Sun Daily

According to data presented by StockApps, more than a third of that value is held by New York-based money management firm BlackRock, with USD7.3 trillion in assets under management. The firm’s assets have surged by 57 per cent since 2015, led by growth in passive investment products through BlackRock’s subsidiary iShares, which is the largest Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) provider in the world. Fellow US money manager Vanguard tipped the balance at USD5.7 trillion in assets under management, ranking as the second-largest asset management group and the largest provider of mutual funds in the world.

Unfortunately, the Labor Department doesn't think these investments belong in your 401(k). In June, the federal regulator proposed a rule that would restrict workplace retirement plans from investments that include environmental, social and governance considerations. Popularly known as ESG or socially responsible investing, this approach considers the sustainability of a company's business practices. The Labor Department says only returns, not business practices, should matter. But its proposal is unusual for a number of reasons, including its wide range of opponents. The rule has been denounced by some of the world's largest investment managers, including BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street Global Advisors and Fidelity, along with groups representing pension funds and 401(k) providers.

Tim Coyne, head of ETFs at T Rowe Price, explains that the firm was a pioneer in growth investing with the launch of the T Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund in 1950. The firm has been looking at entering the ETF market for some years, but waited until it received regulatory approval for an ETF model to align with its active management approach. T Rowe Price has created its own structure to protect the IP of its four funds. “In absolute terms, the approach we are taking only just got approved,” Coyne says. “We are an active manager and we started filing for this product structure in 2013, having lots of conversations and engagements but nothing was the right structure to bring our active strategies to market. “Now there is a product structure, approved by the regulators, that allows us to shield our investment intellectual property, while providing enough information for market participants to make markets in our products.” Commenting on the launch of the four ETFs, Frank Koudelka, Global ETF Product Specialist as State Street Corporation, which is the ETF service provider for the funds, said that his firm has supported T Rowe Price in the development of service models and launch planning. “T.",STT,en,ETF Express

Then, about two months after we first unveiled Wall Street's worst kept secret, the Financial Times also noticed that Corporate America is finding it hard to kick the share buyback habit, even after the US slipped into its worst recession in decades. Citing Credit Suisse statistics, the FT notes that while total buybacks are indeed expected to drop this year as the downturn caused by coronavirus saps corporate profits, companies in the S&P 500 that have reported second-quarter earnings so far have reduced the number of their outstanding shares by an average of 0.3 per cent from the previous quarter .","STT,SU",en,Zero Hedge

Data from Orient Capital reveals that 35.9 per cent of shares in the UK’s biggest companies belong to funds and trusts operated by North American companies. According to Jason Black, chief operating officer at Orient Capital, the “tectonic plates are shifting beneath us and ownership of the UK market is being pulled across the Atlantic”. Two US asset management firms, Vanguard and BlackRock, account for over 10 per cent of the UK index on their own. This is almost equivalent to the portion owned by European institutions, which stands at 11 per cent. “Our data shows significant change in ownership of the UK’s biggest listed companies predominantly due to the growth of passive investing driven by the Big Three North American asset management houses – BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, who together manage more than USD17 trillion in assets.” Passive index funds that offer investors access to the whole market at low cost, has soared, with these types of vehicles doubling their share of ownership from 8 per cent to 16 per cent in the last decade. “It’s no coincidence that passive funds have doubled their holdings in the FTSE 100 and 250 as well; clearly a few North American fund houses have unleashed a demand for low-cost, long-term investment here in the last decade.",STT,en,InstitutionAlassetManager

Nine years and many radical monetary-policy experiments later, it trades at $1,702. That it ought to move higher, and will move higher, is the theme of this analysis. If we’re repeating ourselves, it’s in the noble cause of protecting the wealth of the readers of Grant’s. The sheer brute force of pandemic public policy is tilting the balance of financial risk. History can’t exactly predict the outcome of the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented jag of money creation (never mind the humane reasons why those dollars were set afloat). But as to the perishability of paper money, the record is unarguable. “[T]he French people,” pronounced the Bank for International Settlements in 1949, four years after the end of World War II, “remembering the old gold franc introduced by Napoleon in 1803 (the so-called franc germinal), which maintained its value intact up to 1914, and thus withstood the strain of two lost wars—1814 and 1871—as well as a number of other vicissitudes, cannot help thinking that, compared with the paper franc which since 1914 has lost 99% of its purchasing power, gold, irrespective of any short-term fluctuations in the price paid for it, is in the long run a trustworthy basis for savings.” Even so, it’s not gold but bonds that investors crave.",STT,en,Zero Hedge

2020-05-05 15:48:00-05:00,5 Reasons Why Institutional Investors Refuse to Join the Crypto Sector,"Crypto investors have long believed that institutional investors would lead to the next Bitcoin moon event but this is a false narrative built on nothing more than hope. For the past two years, crypto-media outlets and Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocates have placed heavy emphasis on the need for institutional investors to embrace the cryptocurrency sector. The oft-stated belief was that institutional inflow would lead to mass adoption and an incredible spike in the value of crypto-assets as a whole. Fast forward to the present, and the total cryptocurrency market capitalization has yet to reach the $750 billion all-time high seen in late 2017. The slow recovery of crypto prices raises a few hard to answer questions. If institutional funds have been flowing into cryptocurrencies, why hasn’t there been a significant price increase over the last three years? Either there is an almost infinite sell pressure — which shouldn’t be a barrier considering the total crypto market cap is just $248 billion — or this theory that institutional investment will pump crypto prices does not hold.",STT,en,Cointelegraph

Between a quarter and a third of all food produced for human consumption ends up going to waste every year, costing the food sector billions of dollars and generating a major chunk of the global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation. And the report published on Thursday by Planet Tracker reveals almost half - 44 per cent - of all food loss and waste (FLW) emissions in Europe are indirect emissions generated across supply chains, but that these emissions are largely absent from retailers' corporate carbon accounting books.

Since commencing servicing ETF clients in Ireland in 2010, the team has managed to build the ETF business, from a zero start to USD500 billion of dollars of assets under management at the end of January 2020 in Ireland, and USD118 billion in Luxembourg. “We have a diverse range of clients from the largest global ETF issuers to a boutique offering products that demonstrate their expertise in very specific ETFs,” Fitzpatrick says. “Our scale, personnel, and technology help to drive our success in applying best practice solutions to all of our clients.” For State Street and for the whole industry 2019 was a year of record flows into ETFs. “Demand is still driven by the institutional investor as opposed to the retail,” Fitzpatrick says. “But there are a wider range of institutional investors using ETFs as building blocks within portfolio construction, not just trading ETFs but using them in place of a future or a swap to get exposure to certain markets, or certain geographies such as India or China.” Thematic and active fixed income strategies saw growing popularity in 2019, as did new single market ETF strategies such as Kuwait, Saudi, and China which Fitzpatrick says did significantly well in 2019 “ETFs saw overall use by managers increase in 2019 as opposed to just investing in traditional high cost mutual funds.",STT,en,etfexpress.com

2020-03-29 04:30:52-05:00,Oil-rich wealth funds seen shedding up to US$225b in stocks,"LONDON: Sovereign wealth funds from oil-producing countries mainly in the Middle East and Africa are on course to dump up to US$225 billion (RM973 billion) in equities, a senior banker estimates, as plummeting oil prices and the coronavirus pandemic hit state finances. The rapid spread of the virus has ravaged the global economy, sending markets into a tailspin and costing both oil and non-oil based sovereign wealth funds around US$1 trillion in equity losses, according to JPMorgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou. His estimates are based on data from sovereign wealth funds and figures from the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, a research group. Sticking with equity investments and risking more losses is not an option for some funds from oil producing nations. Their governments are facing a financial double-whammy – falling revenues due to the spiralling oil price and rocketing spending as administrations rush out emergency budgets. Around US$100-150 billion in stocks have likely been offloaded by oil-producer sovereign wealth funds, excluding Norway's fund, in recent weeks, Panigirtzoglou said, and a further US$50-75 billion will likely be sold in the coming months. ""It makes sense for sovereign funds to frontload their selling, as you don't want to be selling your assets at a later stage when it is more likely to have distressed valuations,"" he said.",STT,en,The Sun Daily

2019-06-22 07:01:20-05:00,Inside Slack's direct listing; State Street goes toe-to-toe with BlackRock,"Dear readers, Slack's non-IPO was no doubt the big story of the week, with its success leading some to predict the market could soon see many more direct listings. Colin Stewart, Morgan Stanley's lead banker on Slack's public debut, told Bloomberg we could see as many as five direct listings in 2020. To put that into context, the only two high profile direct listings in the last two years have been Slack and Spotify. Direct listings differ from typical initial public offerings in that they allow existing shareholders like early employees and investors to sell their shares quickly on the free market. The company itself doesn't raise any money and there's much less interaction with Wall Street banks, known as underwriters in a traditional IPO. Talking to a number of bankers and investors prior to Slack's public debut I was pretty skeptical that it would be a hit. This is mainly because I had always been told that direct listings could only be accomplished with well-known consumer brands (Airbnb, for example, is reportedly weighing one).",STT,en,Business Insider
2019-06-18 13:57:13-05:00,The CEO of State Street explains why he's going toe-to-toe with Bloomberg and BlackRock by offering asset managers a one-stop technology shop,"State Street's $2.6 billion purchase of Charles River last year thrust it into direct competition with Bloomberg and BlackRock for control of trading desktops across hundreds of asset managers. The man charged with overseeing the strategy is CEO Ronald O'Hanley, a 20-year veteran of the investment management industry who assumed his role January 1. O'Hanley's building a one-stop shop to handle anything an investor might need, from pretrade analytics all the way through to post trade reporting and reconciliation. The stakes are high. State Street's stock price is down 40% since the Charles River deal. Click here for more BI Prime stories . Ronald O'Hanley doesn't immediately come across as a fierce competitor. The State Street CEO speaks in a low voice free of the bravado that other leaders often exhibit. He doesn't stand on ceremony. And he runs State Street, a leader in asset custody, what many consider to be a sleepy corner of banking. But O'Hanley now finds himself competing against some of Wall Street's most formidable foes.",STT,en,Business Insider
2019-06-15 07:00:00-05:00,"Firms that shunned ETFs are embracing a new kind of fund, which could help them stem the hundreds of billions they're losing each year","In May, the SEC gave the green light to a new kind of exchange-traded fund. Unlike traditional ETFs, the so-called ""non-transparent active ETF"" is managed much like a mutual fund instead of being tied to an index like the S&P 500, and the portfolio manager doesn't have to disclose what's in the fund daily. Now, asset managers are rushing to the space, with more than 30 firms getting ready for their own ETFs. Click here for more BI Prime stories . Some of the asset managers that have long scorned exchange-traded funds are finally looking at entering the space after the SEC approved a new structure that gives them more control — and more revenue. Active managers have been hemorrhaging money for years. In 2018, US investors pulled a near-record $301 billion from active funds, per Morningstar, while lower-fee and more tax-efficient passive funds collected $458 billion. Despite the outflows, many managers have stayed away from passive funds. They view the ""race to the bottom"" – a push to lower fees that culminated with an ETF that will pay investors – as detrimental to their core business of higher-revenue mutual funds.",STT,en,Business Insider

In advanced economies around the world, the output derived from every hour of work has been declining, capping the extent to which workers have been able to contribute to growth. Sluggish productivity gains also help explain why wage growth has been nearly stagnant for most of the recovery. This puzzle — and why it needs to be solved — was one of the threads that ran through panel discussions at the Milken Institute Global Conference on Monday.
