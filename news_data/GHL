The company is reportedly exploring restructuring options for its more than 1,200 Pizza Hut locations and 400 Wendy's locations. The franchise secured $35 million in loans earlier this year to help bolster its liquidity, but also recently defaulted on $800 million of its $1 billion in debt, according to Restaurant Dive. NPC reportedly skipped loan payments and entered into a forebearance agreement with lenders to allow time to weigh options for restructuring. The company is working with advisers at Greenhill & Co., AlixPartners LLP and Eldridge Industries LLC to weigh its restructuring options. A bankruptcy could help the company re-negotiate agreements with landlords and the company is reportedly still weighing options that will keep it out of court. The company's woes are partially attributable to lack of delivery, which is a consumer trend that other fast food companies have been able to embrace with services like Uber Eats and DoorDash.",GHL,en,Zero Hedge
