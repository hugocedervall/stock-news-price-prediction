Then, about two months after we first unveiled Wall Street's worst kept secret, the Financial Times also noticed that Corporate America is finding it hard to kick the share buyback habit, even after the US slipped into its worst recession in decades. Citing Credit Suisse statistics, the FT notes that while total buybacks are indeed expected to drop this year as the downturn caused by coronavirus saps corporate profits, companies in the S&P 500 that have reported second-quarter earnings so far have reduced the number of their outstanding shares by an average of 0.3 per cent from the previous quarter .",KSU,en,Zero Hedge

This week's El Negocio report claimed that the valuation of such a transaction could be $3 billion higher than expected , sending shares on a tear higher. But shortly thereafter, analysts began to cast a light of doubt on the source of the information, according to Bloomberg. The day after the second report was released, it had been taken down from the website where it was published. Credit Suisse analyst Allison Landry said: “We’re not really sure what to make of this. What we are struggling with is why a Spain-based media outlet is reporting on this; it would make more sense to us if it were a Latin American news source.” Blackstone spokeswoman Paula Chirhart said Wednesday: “While we never comment on deal speculation, this appears to be a fake news website.",KSU,en,Zero Hedge

Here's a list — far from exhaustive — of some of the key issues that faced the rail industry this year. Lower Rail Volumes In North America Perhaps the most visible theme in 2019 was the weekly year-over-year decline in rail volumes, which resulted in the readjusting of earnings guidance by some of the Class I railroads. In the first half of the year, severe floods stymied Midwest freight rail operations, with Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP ), BNSF (NYSE: BRK ), Kansas City Southern (NYSE: KSU ) and even Eastern U.S. railroad Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC ) needing to reroute service and/or repair damaged sections of track in states such as Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri. But as the year progressed, rail volumes continued to trend lower as a result of a variety of factors, which deserve their own heading: Trade uncertainty : Strained trade relations between the U.S. and China, in which each country slapped tariffs on the other country's goods (soybeans, consumer goods, etc.), contributed to weakening the U.S. industrial economy because investors were hesitant to proceed with projects until they had more clarity on the direction of the U.S. economy.",KSU,en,Benzinga Feeds

The purpose of the trains is not only to celebrate the holiday season but also to aid local charities. Canadian Pacific (CP) hosts two holiday trains, one that serves a route in Canada and one that serves both the U.S. and Canada. Each train starts in Montreal and travels for three and a half weeks in late November and December. The routes are usually similar year after year, although some segments get visits every other year, such as when the train travels through southern Minnesota one year and southern and eastern Iowa the next. At each of the over 150 stops the two trains make, CP donates money to the local food bank and hosts a 30-minute musical show. Spectators are encouraged to donate money or nonperishable items to a local food bank as well. ""Having the two trains enables us to reach more communities as part of the program,"" said CP spokesperson Andy Cummings.",KSU,en,Benzinga Feeds

It's actually a lot more complicated and interesting than that. Panama boasts an integrated multi-modal transport network made up of container terminals at either mouth of the waterway linked by both a rail line and a highway, allowing for train and truck moves in either direction between the coasts. Container lines don't just pass through Panama via the canal, they also utilize the country's ""land bridge."" This transport complex, comprising multiple stakeholders and competing interests, is ripe for digitalization.
