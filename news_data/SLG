What would normally have been a lavish unveiling for the massive building - owned by SL Green Realty Corp. - instead fell on the deaf ears and the muted pulse of a city that is still all but shut down as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The building's first tenants are set to arrive by the end of the year, according to Bloomberg . SL Green had predicted on a conference call earlier this summer it would have 72% of the building leased by year's end. This falls short of the company's 82% target. We'll take the 'under' on those numbers. The launch of the new piece of property not only comes at a time when the city is shutdown, but also at a time when tenants are fleeing commercial real estate in favor of allowing their employees to work from home. SL Green currently has about 900 tenants across the city and they “all want to be back in the buildings,” according to the company's CEO Marc Holliday.",SLG,en,Zero Hedge

Then, about two months after we first unveiled Wall Street's worst kept secret, the Financial Times also noticed that Corporate America is finding it hard to kick the share buyback habit, even after the US slipped into its worst recession in decades. Citing Credit Suisse statistics, the FT notes that while total buybacks are indeed expected to drop this year as the downturn caused by coronavirus saps corporate profits, companies in the S&P 500 that have reported second-quarter earnings so far have reduced the number of their outstanding shares by an average of 0.3 per cent from the previous quarter .",SLG,en,Zero Hedge
