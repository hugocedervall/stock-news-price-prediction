""I'm just saying what will most likely occur, and I am certain about this, is that self-driving will become much safer than a human driver. Probably by a factor of 10,"" he told Döpfner, adding that the bar for whether a person will be able to drive or not will be much more ""stringent"" in the future when autonomous driving is ""10 times safer.""

For starters, the auto industry is huge: More than a billion passenger vehicles are roaming the planet, with another 80 million or so joining them every year. No single victor could satisfy that level of demand. This was obvious even in the early days of the auto industry, when scores of carmakers, engine-makers, and coachbuilders were competing to put Americans and Europeans behind the wheel. Yes, there were obvious winners and losers: Henry Ford captured a huge amount of market share early on with his Model T, then General Motors grew itself into a competitor and took the lead. But more than a century on, both are carrying on, more or less fine. That's not how races work. In the 20th century, plenty of other famous names got in on the action.

After being snubbed in September, the carmaker has just joined an enviable financial club — and instantly became one of the 10 biggest holdings in the index. The upshot of this momentous event is twofold. First, the short case against Tesla, already shot after the company went on an epic rally at the start of 2020, is now hopeless. Far more investors are going to be passively long Tesla's stock simply because index funds will buy the S&P, and Tesla with it. Second, Tesla's ability to raise additional capital by issuing new shares should encounter little resistance, now that inclusion in the S&P 500 has effectively priced the company to perfection, at a market capitalization of around $400 billion. Basically, it's now safe to stop fretting about Tesla.

What’s interesting as the country’s momentous day begins is that the “horsemen of risk” aren’t really charging out of the gate. Gold is up a little, but bonds and volatility are both lower and Monday’s stock market rally continued overnight. The relaxed approach so far might reflect widespread market belief that once the election is over, fiscal stimulus hopes could reignite. The market is basically saying that whoever gets in, it will be comfortable, and that the winner—whoever it is—is likely to spend money. Though Wall Street is rallying now, it’s gone up and down a lot lately, so there’s no guarantee of early strength lasting. Volume has been thin lately and remains that way, and when volume is low it’s easier to push things around. It’s unlikely, though, that we’ll see people step in and take a big stand right here ahead of the election.

It was a task made all the more tricky by a slippery track but Stirling Moss had its measure in the Vanwall. He and Mike Hawthorn, rivals for the title in this ninth of 11 meetings, tussled for the lead and swiftly opened a gap on the field. Moss was masterful past the pillar boxes and lamp posts and soon held the advantage, while Hawthorn looked to hold second with the brakes on his Ferrari not proving up to the task. A spin on the final lap almost ended his hopes. With the car stalled he leapt out to push-start it, but in doing so rejoined against the direction of the circuit and was disqualified.

One power plant in a city, in fact. In Glendale, California. Glendale is a city of 200,000 people just north of Los Angeles. And in 2014, Glendale was in a tricky spot. The city’s natural gas plant was old. The City Council faced a decision that would impact the municipality for decades to come: revamp the 252-megawatt gas plant, or find local alternatives? After modeling many different types of local resources, the city found the perfect mix: 75 megawatts of utility-scale storage; 15 megawatts of solar, efficiency and demand response; and 93 megawatts of Wärtsilä engines for backup reliability. It saved the city millions of dollars. “And it's just a huge win,"" said David Millar, a resource planning consultant at Ascend Analytics, who helped model Glendale’s energy system, ""and really, an important model for the future of energy.” In this episode, produced in collaboration with Wärtsilä, we look at the hidden hero of the 100 percent renewable future: power systems modeling.",RACE,en,Green Technology

2020-02-05 18:04:45-05:00,The best movie you didn’t see this year might crush it at the Oscars this weekend,"In the competition for the ""Best Picture"" Oscar at this weekend's award ceremony, the conventional wisdom at this point is that it's a tight race between the World War I drama 1917 and Parasite -- the latter a quirky, somewhat hard-to-define film from director Bong Joon-ho that's a little bit of a thriller, a drama, a little bit of a black comedy, and a lot more. Oh, in addition to being one of those where you can't really say too much about it without spoiling the whole thing. Accordingly, the film came out the big winner of a survey Fandango conducted of more than 2,000 moviegoers in the leadup to the Oscars ceremony, a survey that asks fans themselves for the films and performers they think deserve to take home the golden statuettes this weekend. Among the results: Parasite was tipped as this survey's Best Picture winner, but not by much. It was chosen as top pick from fans who think it deserves the honor this weekend, garnering 20% of the vote. However, 1917 , directed by Sam Mendes, followed close on its heels with 19% of the vote.",RACE,en,BGR.com

2019-12-09 11:43:10-05:00,HAHAHA... Apple's 'The Morning Show' has more Golden Globe nominations than 'Game of Thrones',"The Golden Globes nominations are out and we have a few surprises right out of the gate. The biggest one is extremely satisfying, considering what we had to go through earlier this year. Game of Thrones season 8 was the worst season in the show’s history, featuring one of the most awful series finales in television history. In spite of that, the 2019 Emmys netted HBO a record number of Thrones nominations, including an embarrassingly preposterous nom for best writing ( the final episode ). Thankfully, D.B. Weiss and David Benioff did not win, and weeks later the duo revealed they decided not to go forward with their Star Wars plans with Disney. If you feel like you need more reparations for what Thrones 8 put you through, you should know that the show has fewer Golden Globes nominations than Apple’s The Morning Show , which started playing on the newly launched Apple TV+ streaming service only a month ago. Not only that, but Game of Thrones only got one single nomination this year, and that’s for Kit Harrington’s portrayal of a certain Jon Snow.",RACE,en,BGR.com
2019-12-09 09:01:41-05:00,Why Flexible Gas Generation Must be Part of Deep Decarbonization,"Thanks to generous feed-in-tariffs and other incentives, Germany’s wind and solar installations have soared over the past two decades to the point that renewables could cover half of the country’s electricity demand. But given technology and market conditions, a substantial portion of renewable power, primarily wind, is pushed to other European countries at peak times as base load coal must stay online. “They are donating all of this electricity they paid highly for in subsidies to other countries, often with negative prices,” said Jussi Heikkinen, director of growth and development for the Americas at Wärtsilä, a Finnish company that manufactures battery storage and flexible gas power plants. One of the primary reasons Germany cannot use all of the renewable energy it produces is because the nation’s fleet of coal and nuclear plants is still needed to ensure power system resilience when the wind slows or clouds cover the sun. “Coal plants can only ramp down to minimum load, which is typically 50 percent of full output, and that is where you stay,” said Heikkinen. “It takes days to stop and restart a coal plant, which means you can’t manage weather variations.” An emerging problem the world over California faces similar challenges because of its nearly 26 gigawatts of solar. “Something has to fill in the gaps as solar ramps up and down, and to cover the full load when the sun sets at night,” said Joseph Ferrari, general manager for utility market development at Wärtsilä North America.",RACE,en,Green Technology

A pedal-to-the-metal dash through the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari and their tussle for dominance at the Le Mans endurance race, the film weathers its two-and-a-half-hour running time easily, even as it navigates a cheerfully formulaic sports movie structure. What soups up the story is a combination of the efficiently executed race sequences (the gear-crunching, tyre-melting sound design deserves plaudits) and a screenplay by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller, which downplays the competition between the two motor companies and instead frames it as a clash between the mavericks and the man.

That value has lagged both the broader market and certainly growth stocks for the past decade, and also for the past 2 months, is hardly news: with central bank backstops, investors have flocked to companies that boast high growth and/or low-volatility, claiming that ""cheap stocks are cheap for a good reason.""
