2020-12-06 08:15:00-05:00,Goldman Sachs says buy these 19 beaten-down stocks on its 'holiday shopping list' that are poised to break out in the 1st quarter of 2021,"Summary List Placement There's something of a rule that the worst-performing stocks of one year will probably rally at the start of the new year, in sort of a ""what goes down must come up."" Alex Meintel of Goldman Sachs acknowledges that the rule hasn't always held over the last few years, but he says there are good reasons to think the hardest-hit companies of 2020 will spring back in the first three months of 2021. One is simple: It's been a long time since the market's worst stocks looked this bad compared to the rest. ""With 2020 laggards exhibiting the worst YTD relative performance since 2007, and reversals already starting under the surface, we expect there to be a large degree of investor focus on where there are fundamental reasons to support this shift,"" he wrote in a note to clients. Buying 2019's worst performers didn't work in 2020 as markets were swamped in the first quarter when the pandemic hit. But with the global economy re-emerging from a recession, Meintel says he is using a series of methods to find companies that have a much better shot at a rebound at the start of 2021.",BRX,en,Business Insider
