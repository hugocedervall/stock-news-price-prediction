Applications to the quality control agency, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), typically used to be processed within 15 days, but some are now taking up to two months or longer. BIS started delaying approvals in August for China-made imports of devices like smartphones, smartwatches and laptops, part of the fallout from deteriorating ties with China after a border clash in June that left 20 Indian soldiers dead. Since the clash India has tightened rules for investments from China and banned hundreds of Chinese mobile apps, including from tech giants Tencent, Alibaba and ByteDance. It banned 43 more apps on Tuesday. When Apple's new iPhone 12 was caught in the delays, Apple India executives called on BIS to speed its approval up, giving assurances that the company would continue to expand its assembly operations in India, the two sources said.",BABA,en,Economic Times India

The bonds were to be issued by Longbond Ltd, which was to be created specifically to issue digital bonds. The bond, which was to be tradable on the FUSANG exchange, a crypto trading platform, had CCB Lauban as its listing sponsor. The day the bond was to be traded, the Labuan-based exchange received a letter from CCB informing them that the world’s second-largest lender “decided not to proceed” with the issuance. The reason for the suspension wasn't given, said Henry Chong, chief executive of FUSANG. Fusang said in the statement on Monday, “The exchange has accepted this decision, and is announcing the suspension of the listing with immediate effect.” This month, Ant Group met with troubles with its record-breaking IPO, just 48 hours before it was to be listed.

He was stuck tracking the movement of his Bitcoin investment and found it to be ""distracting [his] own focus on [his] own business.""

At least, that was the mindset that Bayer and other agriculture giants had — until now. While many farmers are capable of growing standard soybean crops, companies like Bayer often release specific seeds that can produce higher yields or healthier end-products. Those crops require more oversight on the part of a provider like Bayer — including site visits to watch the seeds get planted, for example — to ensure farmers are complying with the more stringent growing protocols. That's why Bayer and others have to limit access to those speciality product. But as with many other operations , emerging technology is changing that paradigm. On Wednesday, Bayer and software provider BlockApps opened up to the public a blockchain-based effort that was in production for the past several years to track those items from seed-to-sale. For farmers, that means being able to get greater insight into the growing requirements for those premium seeds.",BABA,en,Business Insider

Long before cloud computing was a thing, for instance, Ellison proselytized the premature notion of a network computer. Later he picked up a disgraced ex-computer hardware CEO, the late Mark Hurd , and made him an Oracle selling machine. Then there was the time a few years ago when Ellison seriously considered swapping a giant chunk of Oracle stock for SoftBank's stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. This never-before-reported gambit didn't see the light of the day because Oracle's board of directors squashed it. Given how much Alibaba's stock has outperformed Oracle's, it would have been a hell of a trade. But that's another story.

He had the audacity to criticize China's financial regulations during an appearance at a high-profile industry conference in October. Ma's comments didn't make waves at the time, but nothing escapes the CCP.

U.S. national security policymakers are working aggressively to push back China's global market advance in 5G and artificial intelligence technology. Meanwhile, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is progressing unfettered in a parallel technological campaign: expanding global blockchain infrastructure. Earlier this year, Beijing launched the Blockchain-Based Service Network (BSN), a system of low-cost backend architecture on which software developers around the world can build blockchain applications—including digital assets such as cryptocurrencies. The launch happened a few months after Chinese President Xi Jinping pressed for the nation to leverage blockchain technology to complement the rising economic importance of big data and the ""internet of things."" This BSN has received little attention in the U.S.—but if the network gains significant international adoption, it could give the CCP greater influence in digital commerce and complicate U.S. economic statecraft.",BABA,en,IT Security News

The Tokyo-based company, which has stopped putting out operating profit figures, had net income of 627.5 billion yen in the quarter.Masayoshi Son’s business is recovering from a record loss last fiscal year as a global rally in technology shares lifted the value of stakes in public firms like Uber Technologies Inc. and improved the prospects for startups in its portfolio. But the losses derailed Son’s plans to raise outside money for a follow-up to the original Vision Fund. The second Vision Fund is more modest in scale because it is financed entirely by SoftBank. It has also adopted a more cautious approach, cutting smaller checks at a slower pace.“Vision Fund 2 is showing more discipline,” Atul Goyal, senior analyst at Jefferies, said ahead of the earnings announcement. “But at the end of the day, we need to see some exits and those are probably still years down the road.”One success in the second fund’s portfolio is KE Holdings Inc., a Chinese online property platform that went public in August.",BABA,en,Yahoo Finance

2020-11-05 07:29:08-05:00,Alibaba’s Sales Growth Plateaus Despite China’s Covid Recovery,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s revenue grew at the slowest pace on record for the July-September quarter, underscoring how the e-commerce giant’s post-pandemic rebound is starting to plateau.Revenue for the three months ended September rose 30% to 155.1 billion yuan ($23.4 billion), meeting the 154.8 billion yuan average of estimates. Profit fell 60% to 28.8 billion yuan from the year-earlier period, when it booked a one-time gain from the acquisition of its stake in Ant Group Co. The sales gain may not be enough to reassure investors worried about the derailment of Ant’s IPO, which sparked a $64 billion sell-off Wednesday. The company’s American Depositary Receipts fell as much as 3.4% in pre-market trading.Alibaba had benefited from stronger sales in its home market, which had led the global recovery from Covid-19. Gross domestic product grew 4.9% last quarter, making China the world’s only major growth engine. The e-commerce titan is banking on more than a quarter of a million brands, increased discounting and technologies like livestreamed selling to draw consumers to its annual blockbuster Single’s Day shopping festival, which culminates next week.The earnings headlines were “mixed,” Mirabaud analyst Neil Campling said in written comments, adding that Tmall growth was slower and the number for mobile monthly active users was well below expectations.Click here for a live blog on the numbersAlibaba rallied 6.3% in Hong Kong Thursday, rebounding from the previous day’s losses.",BABA,en,Yahoo Finance

The meeting ended without a discussion of Ant’s IPO, but it was a sign that things might not go as planned.The subsequent unraveling of the $35 billion share sale has thrust Ma’s fintech giant into turmoil, offering a stark reminder that even China’s most celebrated businessman isn’t immune to the whims of a Communist Party that under Xi Jinping has steadily tightened its grip on the world’s second-largest economy.Among the questions that linger as international investors try to make sense of a chaotic 72 hours: Why would China scuttle Ant’s IPO at the last minute after months of meticulous preparation?",BABA,en,Yahoo Finance

O tão aguardado IPO da empresa deve superar a oferta inicial de ações da Saudi Aramco, de US$ 29 bilhões, no ano passado. A empresa pode levantar outros US$ 5,17 bilhões se exercer as opções de lote adicional de Hong Kong e Xangai.

Any U.S. decision on a wider restriction, which Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said would come “shortly,” is likely to be followed by a similar pressure campaign that prompted some allies to ban Huawei Technologies Co. from 5G networks.Even if Microsoft Corp. or another U.S. company purchases TikTok’s American operations by a Sept. 15 deadline imposed by President Donald Trump, the episode is the culmination of a bifurcation of the internet that began when China walled off its own online sphere years ago, creating an alternate universe where Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. stood in for Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.It is also splitting many in the industry: Some decry the betrayal of values like free speech and capitalism, while others advocate doing whatever it takes to subdue a geopolitical rival and its pivotal tech industry.“This sets a dangerous precedent for the U.S.,” said Samm Sacks, a fellow on cybersecurity policy and China digital economy at the New America think tank. “We are moving down a path of techno-nationalism.”Washington’s moves underscore how quickly the concept of an internet decoupling is becoming a reality even as the world is still figuring out its consequences.",BABA,en,Economic Times India

The United States, which was a rising world power at the time, remained off the battlefield for the first two years of the war and became an important supplier to the United Kingdom, France, and other Allied Powers. As a result, the United States became the lender of choice for those that bought US supplies in return for foreign bonds – and gold.",BABA,en,Zero Hedge

In separate interviews, Policybazaar co-founder Yashish Dahiya — whose company is backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd. — and MobiKwik frontman Bipin Preet Singh urged Modi to go further.

India must strategically reduce market access before its neighbor becomes even more powerful. “If India doesn’t do it now, it can never be done,” said Dahiya, whose online insurance service targets a 2021 IPO at a $3.5 billion value.Dahiya and Singh are breaking with tradition in an Indian startup sector that over the past half-decade has attracted billions from Chinese companies and investment houses from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Hillhouse Capital.",BABA,en,Economic Times India

The move will help diversify Tencent's revenue streams, more than half of which came from online video games (35%) and social networks (23%) in the company's Q1 2020 earnings . Tencent's fintech and business services segment, which encompasses cloud services, made up 25% of revenue that quarter. The company's cloud operations are concentrated in China, where it captured 18% of the cloud infrastructure services spend, a distant second behind Alibaba Cloud, which captured 46%, according to Canalys estimates for Q4 2019. Tencent will increasingly go head-to-head against US-based cloud providers as it looks to capitalize its cloud investments in markets outside of China. US cloud providers generally don't compete in China, and Chinese cloud providers generally don't compete in the US. But outside of these markets — the two largest in the world in terms of cloud infrastructure revenues — both US- and China-based cloud providers have expanded their cloud infrastructure such that they compete head-to-head.",BABA,en,Business Insider

Here's how it works.","Provinces and cities across China are slowly lifting their strict coronavirus lockdown measures. Wuhan, where the coronavirus broke out, plans to end its lockdown on April 8 . Local authorities are trying to prevent further spread by controlling citizens' movements via smartphone software installed in WeChat and Alipay, two popular instant-messaging and online payment apps. After people fill out a quick health survey, the software issues them with a colored health code — green, yellow, or red — which dictates whether they can leave the house and where they can go. Officials manning various checkpoints across the country are checking people's health apps to see where they are allowed to go. Anyone with a green code is free to travel. But Western nations are critical of this mass surveillance tool and questioning what else the data is being used for. Scroll down to see how it works.

The all-stock deal was first announced on January 22. Uber said in its filing that the “estimated fair value of the consideration received is $206 million, which includes the investment valued at $171 million and the $35 million of reimbursement of goods and services tax receivable from Zomato.”Zomato’s valuation, which stood at over $3 billion in January, seems to have, however, been discounted during its buyout of Uber Eats India. According to the restaurant discovery and online food-delivery app, the discrepancy in the valuation was because Uber did not receive the same rights as that of a primary investor. “The Uber deal was done at a lower valuation since it didn’t get any rights that a primary investor would have gotten, for instance, liquidation preference, right to information, etc,” a Zomato spokesperson told ET.Zomato Media allotted 76,376 Non-Voting Compulsorily Convertible Cumulative Preference Shares to Uber India Systems, with a face value of Rs 9,000 at a premium of Rs 1,71,153, for a total issue price of Rs 1,80,153 per share, regulatory filings by Zomato on February 4 showed. “In consideration for the purchase of shares of Uber Eats, Zomato has paid through the issuance of Compulsorily Convertible Cumulative Preference Shares in itself to Uber, which is allowed under Indian laws,” said Dipti Lavya Swain, M&A lawyer and Partner, HSA Advocates. “This way Uber has effectively made an investment in Zomato,” he said.On January 10, according to a stock exchange filing by Zomato parent Info Edge, existing investor Ant Financial, an affiliate of Chinese internet giant Alibaba, led a $150 million investment round, valuing it at over $3 billion pre-money, or before the investment.",BABA,en,The Economic Times India

Sources told Bloomberg that containers of frozen pork, chicken, and beef (mostly from South America, Europe, and the US) are piling up at Tianjin, Shanghai, and Ningbo ports because of the lack of truck drivers and many transportation networks remain closed. Seaports in China are quickly running out of room to house the containers and cannot provide enough electricity points to keep existing containers cold.

We should be cautious about FTAs (that lead to more imports than exports), and shouldn’t be all-welcoming towards FDI and MNCs. We should promote desi companies over foreign ones.

Until that moment, the Japanese investment giant’s Vision Fund was known more for investments in consumer-facing technology firms such as online retailer Flipkart and payments major Paytm in India, and players like China’s e-commerce behemoth Alibaba and ride-hailing operator Uber globally. SaaS firms like Freshworks may not match consumer internet companies in terms of valuations, but they have a clearer path to profitability and predictable growth.For the Chennai and California-based company, which was launched in 2010 and valued at $1.5 billion in 2018, the round is meant to be a precursor to an eventual public offering in 2021.

Boss Mukesh Ambani, stands to benefit from the 21st century mantra in two important ways as he carves up his sprawling $130 billion conglomerate. He would fulfill a bold promise to significantly cut debt and achieve a higher, tech-like valuation from investors. India's richest man is overseeing the biggest overhaul of his company since it was split in 2006 as part of a family feud. A plan to be nearly free of net debt by March 2021 involves paying off some $22 billion. That should also help achieve another implicit goal: a punchier valuation than 15 times the earnings analysts are expecting. Some large deals to achieve the goal have been sketched out. Reliance is aiming to pocket about $15 billion from offloading a 20% stake in its refining and petrochemicals arm to Saudi Aramco. Existing cashflow also will be used, along with proceeds from a desired sale of optical fibre assets. The real deal for 2020, however, will be buying a stake in its recently reorganised technology business.",BABA,en,Reuters

Here's a look at how those predictions fared. We missed the mark on two key predictions last year: Foldable phones weren't a hit with consumers this year. We expected that foldable phones would see a spike in popularity, given that consumers continue to purchase smartphones with larger screens and are using them for digital activities that were traditionally done on large-screen devices like laptops and tablets. While an array of smartphone vendors including Samsung, Huawei, and Motorola introduced their own foldable smartphones, consumers weren't quick to gravitate towards them. For instance, Samsung expects to sell only 500,000 units of the Galaxy Fold this year — a fraction of the nearly 294 million handsets it sold in 2018. Lower demand than expected for foldables could in part result from the decision by many smartphone vendors to push back release dates.",BABA,en,Business Insider

2019-12-27 08:42:58-05:00,Tech Companies Downshift Ambitions for Electric Vehicle Manufacturing,"Technology companies continued to curb their ambitions for manufacturing electric vehicles in 2019. At one point, Apple was reportedly planning to launch an electric vehicle by 2019 , but after much hype around its secretive initiative called Project Titan, the iPhone maker shifted gears on EVs several years ago. While Apple continues to file automotive-related patents, its efforts now appear focused on infotainment and autonomous driving software rather than building a car from scratch. In October of this year, U.K. consumer electronics firm Dyson dropped its plans for what was described as a “fantastic car” after failing to drive down costs. “Though we have tried very hard throughout the development process, we simply cannot make it commercially viable,” admitted founder and chairman James Dyson in a letter to staff . Dyson’s EV development project was part of a £2.5 billion (USD $3.2 billion) investment that kicked off with the purchase of solid-state battery startup Sakti3 in 2015 and included the creation of a manufacturing plant in Singapore last year. “What you’re seeing is that it is still hard to make cars,” said Colin McKerracher, head of advanced transport at the analyst firm Bloomberg New Energy Finance. “Making an automobile that’s going to be on the road for 15 years in rain and wind and snow is still a remarkably complex manufacturing and engineering feat.",BABA,en,Green Technology

In comparison, Alibaba Group founder Jack Ma’s net worth grew $11.3 billion, while Jeff Bezos lost $13.2 billion.The surge in Ambani’s fortune this year was fueled by a 40% jump in the shares of his Reliance Industries Ltd., a conglomerate that’s pivoting more toward consumer offerings than its core oil refining and petrochemicals businesses.

2019-12-05 21:57:44-05:00,Saudi Aramco raises $25.6 bn in largest-ever IOPO,"NEW YORK: Saudi Arabia's state oil company Aramco launched its initial stock offering on Thursday, pricing at the high end of the target range and raising $25.6 billion, two sources told AFP. That sum raised by the oil giant surpasses the $25 billion raised by the Chinese online trading group Alibaba when it debuted on Wall Street in 2014. The market launch also puts the Saudi oil behemoth's value at $1.7 trillion, far ahead of other corporate giants in the trillion-dollar club: Apple ($1.2 trillion), Microsoft and Alibaba ($1.1 trillion). However, it fell short of the $2 trillion mark the kingdom's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was aiming for. Aramco will begin trading three billion shares on the country's Tadawul stock exchange December 12 at a starting price of 32 riyals ($8.53), the sources said. That price is at the top of the range set last month, even though the banks advising the company called on Saudi authorities to be cautious to avoid volatile price swings in the first days of trading.",BABA,en,The Sun Daily

The money raised by the state-owned producer breaks the record set by Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba in 2014, but gives the company a valuation well below the $2 trillion sought by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. According to Bloomberg, the closely watched deal which was confined to Saudi accounts over fears of the types of questions that would emerge in an international roadshow, saw a total of $119 billion in subscriptions and was 4.65x oversubscribed but that is simply laughable considering that the Saudi were forced to once again extorting its oligarch like Prince Alwaleed to invest in the IPO at the metaphorical (and perhaps literal) barrel of a gun.",BABA,en,Zero Hedge

Witness the automation that has slowly crept into its operations: Workers are increasingly being replaced on repetitive tasks as businesses perceive higher efficiency with machines than humans. E-commerce majors like Alibaba and JD.com have built automated warehouses in China that are run completely by robots, doing away with the human workforce variable. Against that backdrop, robots-as-a-service is a concept that is gaining traction, and for the right reasons. Automation, albeit highly productive, has traditionally been heavy on the pockets as small and mid-tier warehousing businesses struggle to muster the initial investment. Robots-as-a-service circumvents this problem by requiring minimal investment from warehousing businesses to bring automation to their floor. ""Robots-as-a-service is becoming very popular right now.

Reflecting on failures during his career, Son said last week that “the small crises that pop up here and there today are mere child’s play”. One can understand what he was getting at, of course. Softbank has backed some big successes over the years – notably Alibaba, the huge Chinese online retailer – so you can’t blame Son for defending the idea that an occasional loss is part of the game when you’re in the business of spotting visionaries who can transform entire industries.

It developed the cash-on-delivery model and made its own billion-dollar logistics unit in an economy rife with a fractured logistics system. After building a business up from scratch, the ecommerce company stirred up the market further in 2018 when Walmart acquired it for $16 billion. All this while, another potentially mammoth business was sprouting under its shadows.The foundation of this business came from Flyte, the digital music and content business Flipkart tried to build in 2012. But the online music store couldn’t beat the odds. Neither e-wallets nor paying for music were widespread in India then. A bunch of other reasons also led to the venture closing within a year. But the lack of a smooth online payment process had planted the seeds of a potential money-spinner: a payments platform.The brains behind Flyte, Sameer Nigam and Rahul Chari, used the learnings from their failed venture to exit Flipkart and set up PhonePe in 2015, hoping to ride the coat-tails of India’s exploding digital payments ecosystem.",BABA,en,The Economic Times India

Paytm, backed by SoftBank and the Alibaba Group and a leader in the segment, has been absorbing the charge and hasn’t been charging anything extra for payments made through its platform.The new levies will be applicable for all modes of digital payments topping up the wallet, paying utility bills or school fees and buying cinema tickets. “There is a cost associated with every transaction,” said one of the persons. “Now (Paytm is) trying to cover that cost by passing them onto the consumers.” The person said the additional charges would be effective from Monday.Paytm said it is merely passing on the MDR that banks and card companies charge and denied levying any convenience fees. “In case there is any fee being charged, then it is in fact the MDR being passed on by the merchant to the customer,” a spokesperson said. “Paytm does not (itself) charge any convenience fee or MDR from the consumers and has no plans to levy the same in the future.”Experts said the decision was economically justified.“In 2016, when digital payment was in its infancy, it needed 0% MDR for the uptick of the overall digital payment.",BABA,en,The Economic Times India

Then President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on thousands of goods made in China, and Lin faced a difficult choice: eat the additional cost or try and pass it onto his mostly American customers. He chose to raise prices and watched sales of some products dive by as much as one third in just two weeks. Amazon.com Inc. merchants around the world are scrambling to navigate an unpredictable trade war that’s upending their proven business model of buying inexpensive goods in China and selling them at a markup in the U.S. The problem is particularly acute now as Trump weighs another $300 billion worth of tariffs, many on consumer goods.Mom and pop sellers won’t be able to wait for Trump’s decision: They have to place factory orders now and figure out pricing if they want to get their goods made in time for the lucrative Christmas shopping season, when they make as much as half their annual revenue.",BABA,en,The Economic Times India

Change looks different in mature markets like the US, where the overall expansion of the digital payments market will remain more tempered, but mobile's impact will surge as customers move from PCs to mobile and other emerging connected devices for their online shopping, and replace small-dollar cash P2P transactions with mobile apps like Venmo and Zelle.",BABA,en,Business Insider

Neither the US nor the Chinese tariffs will take effect in full immediately.

Companies long resisted publishing individual compensation of top managers, whose pay is often a fraction of what many of their global peers receive. German chief executive officers rarely get more than €10 million ($11.2 million) annually. Volkswagen AG paid its CEO around €8 million last year, less than half the $22 million Mary Barra made at General Motors Co., even though VW’s sales are almost twice the size of GM’s. And on average, German leaders earn 97 times as much as employees, vs. 312 times as much at the biggest U.S. companies, according to the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. Yet a trio of German millennials could upend the status quo—and become Europe’s highest-paid executives in the process. Zalando SE’s three co-CEOs—Robert Gentz, David Schneider, and Rubin Ritter—stand to rake in a combined $570 million if they can more than triple the share price and roughly double the sales generated by Europe’s largest online fashion retailer within five years.",BABA,en,Bloomberg

Jade’s parents resisted TikTok at first. They hadn’t heard of the app and, Jade says, “didn’t like the idea of strangers watching me sing alone in front of the pink curtains in my bedroom.” But she convinced them that TikTok was “friendlier for kids than other apps like Facebook.” They let her join last year, just as, it seems, every other teenager signed on as well.

Federal Reserve policymakers see something the rest of us don’t, the thinking goes, and that’s why they have all but canceled interest-rate hikes once planned for 2019. Bond traders obviously know something stock investors are missing, so they’ve inverted the yield curve by pushing yields on 10-year Treasuries below rates on three-month bills in a classic harbinger of a recession. And will you get a load of this herd of unicorns prancing their way toward initial public offerings? Clearly their bankers have whispered in their ears, alerting them that the grass is high in public markets and now is the time to graze because a drought is coming.

2019-02-22 19:05:00-05:00,YouTube Demonitizes Anti-Vax Channels After BuzzFeed Contacts Advertisers,"YouTube on Friday demonetized channels which promote anti-vax content, after BuzzFeed notified a spate of advertisers that their ads were being run alongside anti-vax videos, reports BuzzFeed . YouTube said that such videos fall under its policy prohibiting videos with ""dangerous and harmful"" content to be monetized. ""We have strict policies that govern what videos we allow ads to appear on, and videos that promote anti-vaccination content are a violation of those policies. We enforce these policies vigorously, and if we find a video that violates them, we immediately take action and remove ads,"" reads an emailed statement from YouTube to BuzzFeed. Seven different advertisers said they weren’t aware their ads were appearing on videos like “Mom Researches Vaccines, Discovers Vaccination Horrors and Goes Vaccine Free,” which advocates against vaccinating children, and reached out to YouTube to pull the programmatic placements. Their ads appeared on videos from channels including VAXXED TV, LarryCook333 (a proponent of StopMandatoryVaccinations.com), and iHealthTube, all of which YouTube has since demonetized, or prevented from running ads. - BuzzFeed One health tech company, Nomad Health, told BuzzFeed News that it ""does not support the anti-vaccination movement,"" and was ""not aware of our ads running alongside anti-vaccination videos."" The company said it would ""take action to prevent it from happening in the future."" Another such advertiser - discount vitamin company Vitacost, said it pulled all of its advertising on Tuesday after a blogger made a viral video highlighting a "" soft-core pedo ring "" operating on the platform. ""We pulled all YouTube advertising on Tuesday morning when we noticed content issues.",BABA,en,Zero Hedge
2019-02-22 11:42:44-05:00,These Are The 50 Most Popular Hedge Fund Longs And Shorts,"After a dreadful year for professional (carbon-based) money managers, when in 2018 the average hedge fund posted the worst return since 2011, equity hedge funds have had a strong start to 2019, returning 6% YTD. Although far from discovering some new source of alpha, according to Goldman's analysis of the latest batch of 13F filings, the recent strong hedge fund returns have benefited from the outperformance of the most popular long positions as well as the decision to increase net length ahead of the equity market bottom in December 2018. Furthermore, the relative performance of Goldman's Hedge Fund VIP basket and hedge fund net long exposure each bottomed in the days before the S&P 500 reached its low on December 24. So far in 2019, the VIP basket, which tracks the most popular long positions, has returned +14%, outperforming both the S&P 500 (+11%) and Goldman's basket of the largest short positions (GSTHVISP, +7%), which is to be expected in light of the massive short squeeze that has taken place in the past 9 weeks.",BABA,en,Zero Hedge

Weak manufacturing-activity surveys across Asia were followed by disappointing numbers in the euro zone, sending MSCI’s index of world shares 0.4% lower. ""The disappointment that came through in December has transferred into January as well,” said Jingyi Pan, a Singapore-based market strategist at IG Asia Pte.
