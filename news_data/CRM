(MSFT, CRM)","Summary List Placement Salesforce's decision to buy workplace messaging app Slack for $27.7 billion puts the company in head-on competition with long-time frenemy Microsoft. It's the latest twist in a long history of partnerships and disputes. The two tech giants have had a complicated relationship over the years, perhaps starting in the mid-2000s, when former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff traded public jabs. The animosity continued for nearly a decade, until Microsoft named a new CEO, Satya Nadella, who introduced a friendlier Microsoft. Nadella ""opened a door that was closed. And locked. And barricaded,"" Benioff said at the time. The companies partnered for the first time, and Nadella even appeared at Salesforce's big Dreamforce conference. But tensions started to rise once again as Microsoft tried to buy Salesforce in 2015, according to CNBC, and later beat Salesforce in a contentious bid to acquire LinkedIn . Buying Slack was a clear move for Salesforce to expand beyond its core customer relationship management products and bring collaboration into the platform, while positioning itself to compete with Microsoft. ""If Salesforce wants to expand beyond its core gold mine of sales and marketing departments and further into the enterprise, this was the moment and thus represents a major shot across the bow against Microsoft,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients.",CRM,en,Business Insider

Right now only 35% of company workloads are run on the cloud, but that number is expected to grow to 55% by 2022, spurred in part by accelerated digital transformation due to remote work and the pandemic, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients earlier this week.

Baird analysts agree, writing in a note to clients earlier this week that ""with digital transformation in full swing, we wouldn't be surprised by additional strategic M&A."" The report about Salesforce's interest in Slack comes shortly after Adobe acquired work management tool for marketers, Workfront ,for $1.5 billion, a deal that DA Davidson analyst Rishi Jaluria described at the time as a sign that companies were looking to add collaboration tools to their product stack.

But digital currency aside, it also holds the promise of helping enterprises track global supply chains more closely or more quickly run background checks on potential partners, among other use cases. Unlike emerging tech like artificial intelligence , however, enterprise adoption of blockchain has been tepid at best — with many companies opting for small pilot projects instead of large-scale deployments. Some have even labeled it a ""solution in search of a problem.""

Before the pandemic, 39% of US office employees worked remotely—which nearly doubled to 77% during the pandemic, per a June PwC survey. Now, company leaders across the US are strategizing how to resume operations and restore normalcy by bringing their employees back into the office. In order to reopen brick-and-mortar offices, warehouses, and stores, it'll be of paramount importance for employers to navigate how to do so safely and instate routines that curb the spread of the coronavirus. Otherwise, employers risk creating sites of new outbreaks and being forced to shut their doors yet again. The pandemic could hike up employer medical spending—creating an even greater sense of urgency for products that help ensure workers are in good health.

Tomorrow’s Jackson Hole symposium—which won’t be in Wyoming for obvious reasons—is a good example. It sounds like Powell’s going to be talking inflation in his speech after tomorrow’s opening bell, and the 10-year Treasury yield has been creeping up as investors await his words. While stocks have a mixed tone this morning, it’s interesting to see the 10-year yield climbing above 0.7% early on for the second day in a row. This might point to investors getting a sense that the Fed can’t be ultra-dovish forever, though it seems doubtful Powell would change his tone tomorrow. Headlines emphasized that Powell might be addressing “average inflation targeting,” which means letting inflation run hotter than 2% at times to offset other periods when inflation is below that. This could translate into the Fed getting less focused on its longtime 2% inflation target and allowing inflation to run above 2% if it’s spent a long time below that.",CRM,en,Benzinga

But major tech companies like Apple and Facebook are starting to send some employees back to the office, even as coronavirus cases in much of the country, including in California, continue to rise. How a workplace handles COVID-19 in its ranks is often left up to the company. There is little mandate from federal or state governments in how companies should deal with and communicate infections to employees, though there are guidelines. Federal and local health departments recommend employers notify workers who come in contact with an infected person and advise sick and potentially sick employees to stay home. There are no obligations to close offices or tell employees of a confirmed COVID-19 case among staff, should one happen. With so much of the response left up to businesses, the question becomes: What will your company do if someone gets sick? Melissa Perry, a public health researcher at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health, advises employers to be flexible about reopening and to do so on a trial basis.

Here's the pitch deck it used.,"Deepgram offers a speech recognition service that's built on deep-learning technology. CEO and cofounder Scott Stephenson got the idea for the service while monitoring a dark matter experiment two miles underground.

Click here for more BI Prime stories . Scott Stephenson got the idea for Deepgram, his speech-recognition startup, in an unlikely place — deep underground. Four years ago, Stephenson was a postdoctoral researcher working on a project to detect ""dark matter,"" the term for the thus-far undetected collection of sub-atomic particles that theoretically comprises the vast majority of matter in the universe. He and his team set up sensors at the former Homestake Gold Mine in South Dakota , some two miles below the surface of the Earth.

After getting their experiment up and running Stephenson and his colleagues had little to do during the eight to 10 hours a day they'd spend down in the mine except monitor the equipment to make sure nothing was going wrong.",CRM,en,Business Insider

Cloud companies like Salesforce pioneered the model, but experts say the 2008 financial crisis was the inflection point — as companies cut costs, the pay-as-you-go model became very attractive. Companies like Adobe and Microsoft made the switch to focus on a subscription model and have reaped the rewards, as their businesses boom. Subscription software companies say that the model is actually better for users — the software gets more features, more often, and customers don't have to pay a high sticker price up front to get started. However, critics note that over the course of the lifetime of a subscription, users will often pay more than they would have if they bought the software outright. Experts say the model is here to stay: It makes it easy for corporate customers to sign on small teams to use specialized, industry-specific tools, just for starters.

Researchers led by Steve Nerem, a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder, looked at satellite data dating back to 1993 to track sea-level rise. Their findings , published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal in 2018, show that sea levels aren't just rising. The rate has been accelerating over the past 25 years. Even small increases can have huge consequences, experts on climate say. If the worst climate-change predictions come true, coastal US cities from New York to New Orleans will be devastated by flooding and greater exposure to storm surges by 2100. The research group Climate Central has created a plug-in for Google Earth to illustrate how catastrophic an unlikely, ""extreme"" sea-level-rise scenario would be if the flooding happened today, based on 2017 projections from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

But are you familiar with the cloud's landlords? ""Cloud czars"" don't operate entirely on their own. There's a huge industry in connecting these clouds to each other, and to large and small customers alike. It requires cell towers, data centers and other communications technology. A number of real estate investment trusts (REITs) specialize in properties and other assets that ensure your tablet can stream Netflix (NFLX) content and that your company's data is secured in the cloud. As a reminder: REITs are a special type of business structure - one that requires at least 90% of taxable income be paid out to shareholders as dividends, in exchange for generous tax benefits.

In this lengthy bull market, investors have earned greater returns by buying richly valued stocks that hold the promise of strong earnings growth, particularly those in the technology sector. This dynamic has notably been at play since early May, when investors began to reassess their expectations for economic growth and the Federal Reserve this year, according to equity strategists at Goldman Sachs.",CRM,en,Business Insider

2019-06-21 10:58:49-05:00,Slack had a great market debut. Now analysts are wondering if it can live up to investors' sky-high expectations. (WORK),"Slack's debut on the public markets Thursday drew in investors who gave the company a valuation of more than $19 billion. The company could find it tough to live up to the expectations implied in that market capitalization, which is around 50 times the sales it posted last year. That price-to-sales ratio is far above that of other recently public companies and other firms in Slack's sector. Meanwhile, Slack is losing money and burning cash, and its revenue growth — while still rapid — is slowing. Click here for more BI Prime stories . Slack's spectacular market debut on Thursday may be something of a mixed blessing for the company. Now it has to live up to the exuberant expectations implied in its more than $19 billion valuation. That could prove a challenge. The maker of the popular business messaging software is losing money, burning cash, and has already seen its revenue growth slow markedly. Whether Slack will grow into its valuation is like asking about whether people will ever travel to Mars, said Jerry Braakman, the chief investment officer at First American Trust, an investment firm that has about $1.5 billion under management. ""Can we get to Mars?",CRM,en,Business Insider

2019-06-19 12:41:41-05:00,Salesforce is applying an incredibly simple data strategy to address the gender gap,"Salesforce gives leaders of a team of 30 or more people a scorecard to track how often they promote and hire women. To date, the company is 31.6% female, up from 30.1% two years ago. Tony Prophet, the company's chief equality officer, said the practice allows managers to actively address how they created a more diverse company month by month. Salesforce also audits the pay of every employee to ensure no man makes more than a woman for equal work. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. At Salesforce, diversity has a scorecard. The San Francisco-based cloud-computing company hands out monthly scorecards to managers of a team of 30 or more, and they must report how many women they hired and promoted that month. ""I think it's super important for all organizations to be transparent about their representation, for better or for worse,"" said Tony Prophet, Salesforce's chief equality officer, at the New York Times New Rules Summit this week. The scorecard allows every manager, even the top executive leadership, to see exactly how much progress they are making in creating a more diverse company, ""When folks see this data they say, 'Are you proud of this data?",CRM,en,Business Insider

To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here . The majority of global consumers (52%) expect to be able to find what they need from a company in three clicks or less, according to a report from Salesforce. But companies are coming up short of consumers' expectations, as just 40% of shoppers can generally accomplish their task that quickly, which can mean missed sales opportunities for e-tailers. Here's what it means: E-tailers should consider personalizing the shopping experience for each consumer to meet this expectation — and AI is important to doing so. Personalizing websites' appearances can cut down on the number of clicks required to locate an item. Websites can use segmentation and individual consumer data to choose what's presented to consumers based on what they may want, potentially surfacing relevant items and categories faster. This includes tactics like showing new customers high-level branding about a company while displaying previously purchased products to returning shoppers, as personalization vendor Dynamic Yield did for beauty company Kopari.",CRM,en,Business Insider

Frigon's fund has soared 22% over the past year, putting it in the 95th percentile relative to competitors. It's not lost on Gerry Frigon that there are roughly half as many public companies now compared to 15 years ago. For a money manager like him, that's made it doubly difficult to find market-beating investment opportunities. But if recent results are any indication, that hasn't stopped him from reaping impressive returns. Frigon is the lead manager of the Taylor Frigon Core Growth Fund , which recently cracked Kiplinger's top 10 ranking for mutual funds . According to Bloomberg data, the fund has soared 22% and beaten 95% of its peers over past year, nearly doubling the benchmark S&P 500 over that period. Frigon — who is also president and chief investment officer at Taylor Frigon Capital Management, where he oversees $200 million — attributes this to a strategy that involves looking for largely undiscovered early-stage companies. ""We talk about taking a venture capital approach to buying public companies,"" Frigon recently told Business Insider by phone. ""We're sort of the antithesis of modern portfolio theory.""
