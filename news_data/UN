Twitter said it also plans to announce a number of new third-party brand safety partnerships in the coming weeks. Like other social platforms, Twitter has to balance letting users freely publish content with the needs of advertisers who don't want their ads to appear near trolling, misinformation, pornographic or otherwise harmful material.

The report, which includes data from big brands such as Mars, Unilever, Coca-Cola, Nestle, PepsiCo, and Danone, notes an uptick in the amount of recycled plastic used in packaging in 2019 compared to the previous year, with signatories averaging 6.2 per cent recycled content.

""We're in the midst of a significant transformation of the Gillette business, a business that hasn't performed as we would have wished over the last decade,"" he said in an interview with Business Insider.

It involved only a single company, but it could herald the start of a fundamental shift in the choices that diners make. I’ll get to what happened in a minute, but first take a step back and consider the information available when you buy food. At the grocery store, you’re bombarded with labels: organic and its new extension, regenerative organic; various competing fair trade standards; certifications relating to animal health and so on. Notice that these widely used labels tell you nothing about the climate change impact of your choices. If you’re eating out, you might find calorie information on menus and, typically at more boutique restaurants, notes on where ingredients were sourced from. Again, you’re unlikely to see anything relating to climate. This matters, because the greenhouse gas emissions generated by different kinds of food vary widely.","UN,UL",en,GreenBiz

The pickup reflects cost-push factors associated with the pandemic, such as social distancing and screening of customers, as well as fewer workers in urban centers after migrating back home during the nationwide lockdown.“While the increase is not much, directional movement is rather counter intuitive since services inflation is mostly synchronous to the demand cycle,” Samiran Chakraborty, chief India economist at Citi, wrote in a report last week.That complicates the central bank’s inflation outlook, which forecasts overall consumer-price growth to slow to 5.4% in the three months to December from about 7% last quarter.","UN,UL",en,Economic Times India

He set some of the most ambitious sustainability targets ever proposed by a multinational, and became a high profile backed of both the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on climate change. The approach was more than vindicated, as sales of products with green credentials soared and hundreds of other businesses began to emulate the wide-ranging approach to sustainability that Unilever had pioneered. Since leaving the company last year, Polman has set up a new sustainabiluty venture and campaign group Imagine, which is working to mobilise business leaders to accelerate action on tackling climate change and gobal inequality.

Overall, short sellers made gains from more than half of all FTSE 100-listed companies (53 out of 100), according to new data from Ortex Analytics, with Rolls Royce proving to be the most profitable wager, bringing in GBP187.7 million for bearish managers. September’s bounce-back marks a reversal of fortunes for hedge funds betting against FTSE 100 companies, an index often seen as a bellwether for investor confidence. In August, managers suffered a GBP420 million hit after UK equity market gains sent many sizable short bets southwards. Peter Hillerberg, co-founder of London-based equity research firm Ortex, noted that four of the five most profitable shorts in September had earlier been significant loss-makers in August, underlining how renewed uncertainty over the Covid-19 pandemic has underpinned the rebound. “Last month we saw a number of big trades turn sour for short-sellers which impacted overall profitability in August,” Hillerberg observed. “At the time, we predicted that the pendulum may swing back the other way in September and that’s exactly what we’ve seen as short sellers continue to profit from the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic.” Among the big bets to pay off were International Consolidated Airlines Group, owner of British Airways, Aer Lingus and Iberian.","UN,UL",en,Hedgeweek

That undermines natural capital, and damages human capital with its negative health impacts. Finance also should be sound from the point of view of risk and return – that soundness is shaped by what finance is financing. As an example, in the last four years, the US stock market has gone up by about 50% – yet, oil and gas companies have come down by around 50%.","UN,UL",en,Economic Times India

For years, that was the reality for geolocation data, which tracks people's movements by pinging their cell phones. The data sets were viewed by Wall Street as a secondary need in the world of alternative data, as they usually had to be paired with other information — credit-card receipts, for example — to create an investment signal. Clientele for the data was often limited to a handful of well-resourced funds and banks with serious data-science chops. The pandemic changed all that. With the virus shutting global economies and restricting travel — both internationally and locally — information on how consumers are slowly returning to their past patterns, or have changed them entirely, is in high demand. As a result, geolocation data now has its time to shine. ""We are coming off of one of our best quarters ever,"" said Jason Richman, director of enterprise sales at SafeGraph, a geolocation data provider that counts Goldman Sachs and Jefferies among its clients.","UN,UL",en,Business Insider
2020-10-01 05:38:58-05:00,'It's too late to be a pessimist': Paul Polman urges businesses to 'de-risk the political process' on net zero,"Speaking at BusinessGreen's Net Zero Festival, the former Unilever CEO emphasised business community's increasingly important role in pushing policymakers towards more ambitious climate action In an unsteady political landscape businesses have an increasingly important advocacy role to push policymakers towards more ambitious climate action, former Unilever CEO Paul Polman said yesterday as he brought the first day of the world's first Net Zero Festival to a close. Polman, whose appearance at the inaugural event came just hours after the first Presidential debate of the 2020 US election, lamented a dearth of global governance and politcal leadership on ambitious climate action, and argued it was therefore increasingly up to businesse to ""de-risk the political process"" in order to spur progress towards net zero. ""Advocacy is being dialled up in the private sector,"" said Polman, a leading figure in business sustainability who since leaving the consumer goods giant has co-founded the corporate responsibilty collective Imagine.

All of them are using their artificial intelligence prowess and analytics power to help companies such as BP, Chevron and ExxonMobil continue exploration and extraction. When I asked Microsoft Chief Environmental Officer Lucas Joppa about this tension last year, he told me that changes won't happen overnight. ""Any clear-eyed person recognizes that this happens over time,"" he said. ""We will be relying on fossil fuels for some time."" Indeed, the relationship Microsoft disclosed last week with Shell is slightly different. Broadly focused on the fossil fuels company's digital transformation, the applications being built collaboratively by the two companies are aimed at measuring carbon emissions — both Shell's and those of its suppliers and customers.","UN,UL",en,GreenBiz

Of course, the U.S. recycling system had been a mess for far longer — seeing as the country never fully developed the infrastructure to recycle anywhere near the amount of plastic waste it produces. Indeed, only 8.4 percent of all the plastic produced in 2017 eventually got recycled, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency . But a new agreement announced last week at Circularity 20, GreenBiz Group’s virtual conference on the circular economy, has the potential to change that: The U.S. Plastics Pact. This new initiative is a collaborative project launched by the Recycling Partnership and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) that aims to redesign the way the United States uses plastics so that they don't become waste in the first place.","UN,UL",en,GreenBiz

Its landmark report, ""The New Plastics Economy"" (PDF), sounded the alarm in 2016 that if ""business as usual"" continues, by 2025 the ocean may hold more plastic than fish by weight. Its commitment by the same name has attracted many of the planet's biggest brand names, among 450-plus signatories, to dramatically slash their use or production of plastic by 2025. PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, Unilever and even Tupperware have signed on with governments and NGOs to do away with ""unnecessary"" plastics and innovate so that other plastics will be reused, recycled or composted; and kept out of natural systems.

Global agricultural supply chains can be highly complex, with many layers between a manufacturer such as Unilever and the original land on which the commodities it uses originate.

However, if a firm is to be sure that their purchasing power isn't driving abuses such as deforestation, it must have oversight over every part of their supply chain, as forest is usually cleared to make room for the original crop, according to Unilever.","UN,UL",en,BusinessGreen

One organisation that has followed these developments closely is FAIRR, a network of investors focused on addressing the environmental risks linked to intensive livestock production. For the last four years, FAIRR has engaged with 25 giant global food retailers with combined annual revenues of $459bn, observing and encouraging their evolving experiments with meat-free protein alternatives.",UN,en,BusinessGreen

We woke up to some hope around a possible new U.S. relief package and European strength, and then saw weekly jobless claims come in above expectations. Stocks gave up some of their initial futures market gains after the depressing data. New claims came in just above 1.4 million, up from 1.3 million the prior week and above analysts’ consensus of 1.28 million. Obviously, this is the opposite direction investors had been hoping for, and it means more tough times for many workers. The initial claims figure had been holding relatively steady near 1.3 million for a while, which is terrible from a historic perspective but at least it wasn’t going up. Now the question is whether this is a one-week blip or something more treacherous.

Insider Intelligence analyzes this industry and several others to provide in-depth analyst reports, proprietary forecasts, customizable charts, and more. Learn more about what we offer. Advertisers are pulling money from Facebook and other social media — but that probably won't do much to benefit Facebook's competitors in the digital ad market. With numerous big-name brands announcing a pause on social ad spending, inspired by the Stop Hate for Profit boycott, where will those dollars go instead? There are two reasons why we expect spending previously planned for Facebook likely won't be spent elsewhere: The brands pulling back on spending are generally not performance advertisers, and Facebook is a performance advertising platform. The advertisers pulling spend overwhelmingly fund brand campaigns on Facebook — not performance ones — because their businesses are not optimized for performance advertising.","UN,UL",en,Business Insider

The lab-engineered enzyme molecules can biologically break down PET plastic waste into its original components which can then be rebuilt afresh into new products, in a process that can be repeated infinitiely, claims the study, which was published yesterday in the scientific journal Nature . The solution holds particular promise for coloured, opaque and multilayered PET plastic products, which it claims are difficult to recycle via traditional methods as they degrade rapidly, meaning they often end up incinerated or landfilled after only a few cycles. Yet the newly-developed enzyme solution, meanwhile, can break down 90 per cent of PET waste in just 10 hours, and a demonstrator plant for the technology is sheduled to be running in Lyon by as soon as next year, according to the researchers.","UL,UN",en,BusinessGreen

The sweeping concerns range from compromises on taste, to drastic reduction in consumption since red connotes 'danger', to higher costs, to the regulator under pressure from food lobbies.Going by national food regulator Food Safety & Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)’s proposed regulations, the red dot which has meant non-vegetarian food since 2011, could well now also mean foods high in salt, sugar and fat, which could translate to being “unsafe”. On the other hand, the green dot, or vegetarian food, would make the cut for “safe” food.Pawan Agarwal, chief executive of the FSSAI which will regulate compliance with the provision, said comments from stakeholders are in the process of being finalised after following 'the due process of approval'. “The objective of the new labelling regulations is to enable consumers to know more about the composition of food products, so that they can make informed choices.”Disruptive ImpactIndustry executives say this is the regulator’s biggest and most ambitious bet though the jury is still out on what is safe and what isn’t, adding that since red connotes unsafe or danger, the impact on consumption would be immediate and drastic.","UL,UN",en,The Economic Times India

However, one credit tap is starting to gurgle, giving some cause for optimism. Pocket-sized loans are feeding online consumption, with demand coming from smaller cities and towns. The amounts are still tiny, but as digital spending grows, financing it has the power to turn the page on Indian lenders’ underwriting of soured corporate loans: the source of a $200 billion sigh of collective agony.Taps Have Run DryAmazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart Online Services Pvt claimed record sales during the recently concluded six-day online shopping bonanza that marks the start of the Indian festival season.

Does it seem like softening commodity prices coupled with a strong order book is what one could hear from L&T and maybe some price hikes could aid Unilever’s top line growth this time?We are expecting a weak growth in Lever. We have been highlighting this in the last several quarters and we continue to believe that especially on the soaps and detergents front, there will be downtrading and that is why the volumes as well as margins should be under pressure for Lever.

The latter recently cut HUL’s shelf space by nearly a third in the segment to make space for Future’s own line of detergent liquid and powder products.The new liquid detergent product from parent Unilever’s portfolio, Love Home and Planet, will be HUL’s fifth fabric wash brand, and is expected to be launched next month, said two officials aware of the development. The move is reminiscent of HUL’s introduction of Wheel detergent in 1988 to take on Nirma, which had dislodged Surf as washing powder of choice in middleclass and lower-middleclass Indian homes. HUL’s other detergent brands are Rin, Surf Excel and Sunlight and the company accounts for a third of India’s Rs 24,000 crore laundry market.Common FeaturesHUL is also hoping to score on the green front with an environmentally friendly product.While HUL declined to comment, Future Group said its liquid detergent brand Voom’s positioning is “caring for fabric and fashion”, something that’s new in a segment that thrives on stain removal. “We feel existing laundry makers will follow this narrative but our pricing and fashion push will be far more competitive,” said Ashni Biyani, managing director of Future Consumer Ltd, the group’s consumer goods arm that introduced the product last week.The two brands from HUL and Future Group have some common features.","UL,UN",en,The Economic Times India

But when an acute shortage of banknotes gave a fillip to digital wallets, that purpose was added as an afterthought to justify an act of farcical state overreach.The real innovation in mobile payments in India began a few months prior to the cash ban. It’s called a unified payment interface, or UPI. The name is clunky, but the idea is simple. One smartphone owner who’s a customer of Bank A can request a payment from, or initiate a payment to, another owner who has an account with Bank B. Neither party needs to know anything more than each other’s mobile number or a virtual ID. They don’t even need to use the same mobile app to transact. In this, India was ahead of even Asian money centers like Singapore and Hong Kong. With more than 140 Indian banks sharing the interface, and Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook Inc.’s WhatsApp offering instantaneous payment services on it, UPI has become a keenly watched experiment.","UL,UN",en,The Economic Times India

2019-04-03 11:32:00-05:00,"Amazon advertising, explained: a rundown on the retail giant's fastest growing segemnt (AMZN, FB, GOOGL, PG, UN)","This is an excerpt from a story delivered exclusively to Business Insider Intelligence Digital Media Briefing subscribers. To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here . Advertising is Amazon’s fastest-growing segment: In 2018, Amazon made $10.1 billion from advertising, up 115% from about $4.7 billion in 2017. While it only controls about 7% of the US digital ad market, the e-tailer is considered one of the only credible threats to the duopoly. Is Amazon actually stealing spend from the duopoly? Yes, but the movement is likely concentrated among certain types of advertisers, like CPG brands. Last year, for example, some CPG advertisers reported shifting 50% to 60% of their Google search spend directly to Amazon. That's not a knock on Amazon: CPG brands, like Proctor & Gamble and Unilever, are among the biggest advertisers in the world. For its part, Facebook has gone so far as to publicly recognize the threat posed by Amazon, listing the e-tailer as a competitor in its Q4 earnings.","UL,UN",en,Business Insider
