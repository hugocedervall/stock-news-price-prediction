Their desire for increased control, customisation and transparency is driving an increase in the use of managed accounts. “We believe we are still in the early innings of the shift to managed account structures,” comments Joshua Kestler, Global Head of HedgeMark, “Market volatility and macro uncertainty will drive an increase in the use of managed accounts as a means to maintain tighter control of assets and increased transparency which allows investors to more effectively manage their portfolios from a risk and investment perspective through turbulent times.” The eventual outcome of the US Presidential Election as well as the persisting impact of the Covid-19 pandemic are just two issues driving the potential for increased volatility going into 2021.",BK,en,Hedgeweek

2020-09-02 09:56:04-05:00,The Benefits Of Unsponsored ADRs,"In 2008, an SEC rule change made it possible for depositary banks to create U.S.-traded instruments of foreign companies without the sponsorship of the companies themselves. These instruments, known as unsponsored American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), allow for a depositary bank to facilitate the trading of a foreign company’s shares for U.S. investors to easily access those companies. What Is An Unsponsored ADR Unlike sponsored ADRs such as Roche Holdings (OTCQX: RHHBY ) and Adidas (OTCQX: ADDYY ), unsponsored ADRs are created without formal approval from the company. In some cases, they may not even know about it. A depositary bank may choose to create an unsponsored ADR program if they observe a certain level of market demand. Sometimes an unsponsored ADR will have more than one depositary bank, meaning foreign companies could unknowingly have as many as four U.S. banks competing for assets. Some ADRs are listed on exchanges, but the vast majority of ADRs—both sponsored and unsponsored—trade on the OTCQX Market in the U.S.",BK,en,Benzinga

The value investing strategy, which seeks to invest in companies that are undervalued by the market, has fallen firmly out of fashion in recent years as big tech ‘growth’ stocks like Facebook, Apple, and Amazon have taken over the large-cap equities indexes. Over the past 25 years, growth funds have outperformed value funds, returning an average of 1,072 per cent, versus a more meagre 624 per cent for value funds, according to research from CAMRADATA. Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management, says that value investing pays off in periods of economic instability. He notes that some of the strongest returns for value investing were made in the aftermath of the tech bubble, which burst in the early 2000s.",BK,en,InstitutionAlassetManager

Then, about two months after we first unveiled Wall Street's worst kept secret, the Financial Times also noticed that Corporate America is finding it hard to kick the share buyback habit, even after the US slipped into its worst recession in decades. Citing Credit Suisse statistics, the FT notes that while total buybacks are indeed expected to drop this year as the downturn caused by coronavirus saps corporate profits, companies in the S&P 500 that have reported second-quarter earnings so far have reduced the number of their outstanding shares by an average of 0.3 per cent from the previous quarter .",BK,en,Zero Hedge

The survey shows that only 10 per cent of central banks currently incorporate it fully across their portfolios, while half of the 50 central banks surveyed did not implement ESG measures at all. Other global public investors (GPI) like public pension plans and sovereign wealth funds have been much faster on the uptake. In comparison, 93 per cent of pension funds and half of sovereign funds apply ESG criteria across their whole portfolio. BNY Mellon and OMFIF note in the report ‘Sustainable Investment’ that the relatively weak uptake of ESG criteria for managing investments among central banks compared with their GPI peers is “in contrast to their activities as supervisors, where several institutions have taken steps or are planning to introduce regulatory measures such as climate stress tests”.",BK,en,InstitutionAlassetManager

Paul Benson, Head of Fixed Income Efficient Beta at Mellon, a BNY Mellon Investment Management affiliate with USD534 billion in assets under management, explains that the strategy has been running since 2012 in various different vehicles and currently has USD2.7 billion under management. Part of the aim of the BKHY ETF launch in April this year, was to offer that strategy to a wider range of investors and at a competitive 22 basis points in fees. Originally, the multi-factor approach to fixed income was more within the smart beta territory, Benson says. “We were the multi-factor team and some of our products got a lot of traction,” he says. The result is the Fixed Income Efficient Beta team, which Benson heads. “There are areas in fixed income which are difficult to trade and we see that where the passive and active approach are short of investor return goals,” he says.",BK,en,ETF Express

2019-04-16 06:54:00-05:00,BNY Mellon's head of fintech partnerships explains how working to secure crypto isn't much different from holding gold bars,"As the 'concept of money' evolves, custodian banks like 234-year-old BNY Mellon are changing in tandem, Lucien Foster, the firm's head of fintech partnerships, said in a recent Business Insider interview. The banks used to store gold, money, paper stock certificates, and other valuables in large vaults. Now, with the advent of cryptocurrency, Foster explains how they're catching up to become custodians for a new valuable asset. Foster was recently listed as one of Business Insider's 100 People Transforming Business. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. The future of a major custody bank looks nothing like its past. Gone are gold bars and paper stock certificates, stored in soaring, high-security vaults. In are technology platforms that track forms of currency still in nascent stages. No matter the asset it's storing, the custody bank's role remains the same, explained Lucien Foster, the head of fintech strategy and partnerships at BNY Mellon, in a recent interview. Foster was named as one of the 10 People Transforming Finance. ""You still need custodians, because custodians provide something technology will never provide, which is trust and this idea of surety,"" Foster said. ""The idea of a custodian is evolving, but it's also staying close to its foundational roots of 'I trust that whatever I have of value will be kept safe in whatever form it takes.'""
