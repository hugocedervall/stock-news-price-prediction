Like James Dean and his rivals in the movie Rebel Without A Cause , the companies and their bondholders were like drivers racing towards a cliff. Should investors accept a painful write down on their bonds in order to keep companies alive and avoid even worse pain later on? Or should they call the company’s bluff and insist on full repayment of their debt? The Risky Finance corporate bond tool provides a ringside seat on some of these scenarios. Take the sector whose spreads declined the most on average since March – Oil & Gas. Investors in high yield bonds who bought that month have seen returns of 300% or more, while investment grade bonds have provided a 30% return since then.

Here are the 11 deals the bank says are most likely.,"Summary List Placement Hammered by a collapse in oil prices, the energy industry is entering a new phase focused on returns, which is likely to bring a wave of consolidation, analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note Wednesday. Deals could help US oil companies Exxon and Chevron diversify and build out their clean-energy assets, they said. ""European peers have begun to reposition portfolios away from oil & gas production,"" the analysts said in the note. ""Majors in the US have been slower to adapt despite sharing similar advantages of scale. Focusing on M&A in the power sector, companies with renewable development capabilities could be particularly attractive alternatives to oil & gas."" Today, the energy industry remains fragmented, the analysts said, resulting in a recent spike in deals. Most notably, Chevron acquired Noble Energy in early October through a $5 billion all-stock deal, while shale giants Devon Energy and WPX Energy announced plans to merge in late September. Read more: Layoffs, bankruptcies, and dividend cuts: We're tracking how 20 energy giants from Shell to Exxon are responding to the collapse in oil prices ""M&A has picked up again and, largely for the first time in recent memory, been rewarded by the market,"" Morgan Stanley said.

The world faces a massive supply glut as the coronavirus pandemic has simply removed much of the world's demand for oil. Energy has become so depressed that, a few weeks ago, the unthinkable happened: crude futures went negative. This means producers were paying contract holders to take crude off their hands. The energy market has normalized since then, and oil has moved higher, but we're still looking at low average prices not seen since the Clinton administration. Prices are still well below breakeven costs for most energy stocks, even some of oil's elder statesmen. Dividends have been cut or suspended. Some - including Whiting Petroleum (WLL) and Diamond Offshore (DOFSQ) - have filed for bankruptcy, and other oil and gas stocks could face the same fate. Thus, few energy investments feel ""safe"" right now. But as is the case after every oil crash, some energy stocks will survive.
