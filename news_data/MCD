And even as dining has reopened nationwide, ongoing capacity restrictions and consumer wariness have kept customers home and left engagement down by double digits. As restaurants continue to struggle to earn revenues, they've been forced to adapt their operations in order to keep their doors open.

The sector was already on the rise prior to the pandemic, especially at quick-service restaurants (QSRs): We expected mobile order-ahead annual sales volume would hit $31 billion this year. But the pandemic pushed restaurants to expand their usage of the technology for pickup, delivery, and even in-person dining, bringing penetration to levels not expected until 2023.

What began as a way to manage pain ended up having a positive impact on his career. He would join the founding team at Charlotte's Web , build a seven-figure business at Caliper Foods and co-found multiple hemp and CBD-based businesses.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . The McDonald's Monopoly game was hugely popular in the late 1980s and through the 1990s.

Both companies use little chickens because the size of the quarter pound breasts fits perfectly inside of a bun. A shortage of the little chickens was the cause of Popeye's having to halt their challenge to Chick-Fil-A last summer. The supply is going to be further put to the test as McDonald's is now also entering the fray, testing fried chicken sandwiches in four U.S. cities. Wendy's is also spending $30 million to ""beef up"" its chicken supply chain. Scott Sechler, owner of poultry producer Bell & Evans, said: “Consumers don’t want tough and tasteless big chickens.

This relatively low percentage is despite the fact that many coffee chains provide a 25p discount for coffee bought in a reusable. For all the chatter inspired by the BBC's Blue Planet, it seems people are reluctant to make even a fairly simple change away from disposable products. Hubbub undertook research to discover why the change is not happening. There seems to be a desire to make the shif,t with public polling revealing that over two-thirds of people have their own reusable coffee cup. But tellingly only one in six say they remember to use them every time they buy a hot drink. The most common reason for this gap in reusable cup usage is consumers forgetting to take their cup with them when they leave home in the morning. The number of people using reusable cups drops off during the day as people feel uncomfortable asking retail outlets to wash their cups and refill them.",MCD,en,BusinessGreen

Many of these rules are laid out in the ""Golden Arches code."" Business Insider obtained a 2012 copy of the code. Here are seven of the most surprising rules. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . McDonald's takes Ronald McDonald very seriously. The fast-food giant has determined Ronald McDonald has good eating habits, doesn't smoke and ""does not touch anyone in any inappropriate way."" All appearances of the mascot must be approved by the company and deemed consistent with his ""core personality"" — meaning Ronald McDonald is specifically banned from visiting a nightclub or lounge. The nickname ""Ronnie"" is strictly off limits. These are just a few of the rules spelled out in a 2012 copy of McDonald's ""Golden Arches code"" obtained by Business Insider. The code acts as a marketing bible for McDonald's, intended for internal use, spelling out every aspect of the fast-food giant's brand. ""When we behave according to our values – when our brand actions show how we come together to do good – when brand expressions exude simple easy enjoyment – when our personality shines through all touchpoints – customers will see us as their favorite place and way to eat and drink – and they will be feeling and saying 'i'm lovin' it',"" the 2012 code states.",MCD,en,Business Insider

What they might not have expected was for it to happen so suddenly here at the start of the year. Last night’s U.S. action in the Middle East sent crude prices spiking. Stock futures tumbled, giving back basically all the gains from Thursday in pre-market trading early Friday. Crude is back where it was in September after the attack on Saudi oil facilities, up above $63 a barrel. Iran has vowed to retaliate, so investors might be on tenterhooks waiting for that. Volatility, which dropped sharply Thursday, scurried quickly back above 15 for the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX). One thing investors don’t want to do here is panic. Making moves out of fear isn’t a strategy. Instead, it’s often better to be prudent and let things play out. Sometimes these geopolitical situations seem scary and threatening at the start but don’t end up having a major long-term impact on markets.

But a subsequent report by The Wall Street Journal said the two nations are working on a possible delay of the Dec. 15 tariffs. Equity index futures erased early losses to move into the green by the opening bell. A postponement or cancelation of those duties would likely please stock market participants, at least if the two sides can’t reach an interim deal before then. The world’s two largest economies have been trying to hammer out a deal for some time now, and uncertainty surrounding the trade situation has been the biggest headwind facing Wall Street. But recently, excitement about a partial trade deal getting done soon has helped push the market to record highs.

Easterbrook was successful, well-liked, and respected at McDonald's, making his abrupt firing even more shocking and embarrassing for the company, employees and franchisees told Business Insider. The ex-CEO's romantic involvement with another employee wasn't widely known internally and the identity of the woman remains a mystery, according to interviews with current and former employees. The next day, employees learned David Fairhurst, McDonald's head of human resources and Easterbrook's friend, was also leaving — news one employee called a ""double whammy."" McDonald's new CEO Chris Kempczinski has spent the last two weeks getting the company on board with his vision as a leader, which is strategically similar to Easterbrook's but emphasizes a renewed focus on values and ethics. McDonald's confirmed that Kempczinski and Easterbrook's exits were not related to each other or two other executives' departure earlier this year, but declined to comment further for this article.",MCD,en,Business Insider

A few years later, he was CEO of the brand, and then that role soon turned to CEO of a fast food conglomerate, Restaurant Brands International.

Two sources familiar with the probe told the Los Angeles Times that the unnamed schools, some of the most distinguished in the area, were issued subpoenas by federal authorities for records regarding involved students. INSIDER has reached out to multiple private schools across Los Angeles. INSIDER reached out to Marymount High School, an all-girls private Catholic school attended by actress Lori Loughlin's two daughters, Isabella Rose Giannulli and Olivia Jade Giannulli. In a Youtube vlog of her last day of high school, Olivia Giannulli said ""I'm excited to go do the school prank but I'm also literally never at school … I think my class ... maybe they forget I go there. Kidding!"" The sources familiar with the probe told the Los Angeles Times that officials are not accusing the private high schools of wrongdoing, but instead are trying to seek further information about student performance.",MCD,en,Business Insider

Readers may remember that, when the White House kitchen staff was on furlough during the government shutdown, President Trump bought somewhere between 300 and 1,000 burgers and served them up on silver platters for members of the Clemson Football Team after they won the NCAA championship. When Trump was asked by a reporter at the event which burgers were his favorite (he ordered from McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's) he replied that he liked them all equally because they're all ""great American food."" Apparently, AOC doesn't see it that way. While plugging her GND resolution on the season premier of Showtime's Desus & Mero this week, the Congresswoman said that Americans need to make some changes to their diet and not eat hamburgers for ""breakfast, lunch and dinner"" so we can address the 'problem' of factory farming. ""In the deal, what we talk about - and it’s true - is that we need to take a look at factory farming, you know?",MCD,en,Zero Hedge
