That hasn't stopped automakers from rolling out new battery-powered models and aiming to introduce many more in the next 10 years. General Motors alone has said that it will spend $27 billion to launch 30 electrified vehicles by 2025. On one hand, this is a joyful situation for traditional carmakers.

But staying ahead requires top talent, and in a hotly contested space, that often means paying top dollar.

The US Office of Foreign Labor Certification requires companies to disclose compensation for permanent and temporary employees from outside the US to ensure the firms aren't paying them less than the average wage earned by their peers. The data Business Insider analyzed is from 2020 and represents an average among some of the employees included in Waymo's disclosures.

After being snubbed in September, the carmaker has just joined an enviable financial club — and instantly became one of the 10 biggest holdings in the index. The upshot of this momentous event is twofold. First, the short case against Tesla, already shot after the company went on an epic rally at the start of 2020, is now hopeless. Far more investors are going to be passively long Tesla's stock simply because index funds will buy the S&P, and Tesla with it. Second, Tesla's ability to raise additional capital by issuing new shares should encounter little resistance, now that inclusion in the S&P 500 has effectively priced the company to perfection, at a market capitalization of around $400 billion.

It leaves the reader wondering: what if automakers had taken the problem more seriously a half-century ago? We are still feeling the ripple effects of investigations five years ago showing that ExxonMobil Corporation’s staff scientists were well aware decades ago that petroleum caused global warming.

But that’s just a slice of the costs of switching bus and truck fleets from fossil fuels to batteries. Unexpected costs and bottlenecks in charging infrastructure, fleet operations and maintenance, and permitting and financing weigh on cities and states mandating electric bus fleets, or private companies with large-scale delivery truck electrification goals. Solving for this “total cost of electrification” equation will be a critical step in pushing EV trucks and buses from the margins to the mainstream in the coming decade, according to a report released Wednesday by Environmental Defense Fund, MJ Bradley and Vivid Economics. “We’re seeing the technology increasingly ready, and capital increasingly eager to invest in sustainability” via fleet electrification, Andy Darrell, EDF’s chief of global energy and finance strategy, said in an interview. “And yet the deployment, especially in the medium and heavy-duty sector, might not be moving as quickly as we’d like to achieve big climate goals.” Estimates on the global market for electric trucks and buses range into the tens of billions of dollars over the coming decade, he noted.",F,en,Green Technology Media

Before landing in Cedar Rapids at JET Engineering a few years ago, Helena Long spent 15 years traveling the country as a human resources and training consultant for Fortune 500 companies like Motorola, Dell and Ford Motor Company that had employees scattered all over the country — even the globe. Now serving as JET Engineering’s vice president of human resources and leadership development, she said many of the people she has worked with over the years never met their coworkers in person. Some of the struggles they faced might sound familiar to those working remotely for the first time. “Communication was always a challenge. Building trust was also an issue,” she said.

2020-11-13 09:49:17-05:00,Ford's new CEO explains why his master plan hinges on big data and an electric cargo van (F),"Summary List Placement Jim Farley is many things: veteran executive, motorsports enthusiast, an outspoken leader with a reputation as a hard-charger, and, as of last month, Ford's CEO. He's also, it seems, a ""This Is Spinal Tap"" fan. When Business Insider suggested that when it comes to the importance for the Detroit automaker, the newly-revealed, all-electric Ford Transit commercial van is a solid 10 out of 10, Farley objected. ""E-Transit is like an 11,"" he said. The current Transit lineup — four vehicles are available in the US, with the cheapest starting at $34,510 — has a 50% share of the commercial van market, Farley noted. So he was understandably excited to talk about the E-Transit ahead of its unveiling. When the E-Transit goes on sale late next year, its entry-level cargo van model should be priced under $45,000 for Ford's commercial fleet customers, the company said. A 67-kilowatt-hour battery pack will deliver 126 miles of range on a full charge.

The issue stems from a component that can corrode and eventually fail. If you own one of these vehicles, it's important to get it repaired promptly. Recalls in the auto industry are perhaps a bit more common than any of us would like. Sometimes the recalls are issued for very minor reasons — you know, not something that could potentially lead you to crash — but sometimes they're much more significant. Ford Explorers in the model years 2013 to 2017 have had suspension issues in the past that sparked a recall and part replacement program. Now, it's happening again… with the same cars. As Car And Driver reports, the recall affects some 350,000 Ford Explorers. The issue is a potentially faulty component of the rear suspension called a toe link. This component has been shown to be susceptible to corrosion and, as a result, failure.

Losing Domino's would be a big hit to CPB parent company MDC Partners, led by CEO Mark Penn, as it aims to compete with bigger holding companies. The source said the name being floated as Domino's next agency is Work in Progress, a small independent agency founded by former CPB executives who handled many of Domino's campaigns while at CPB. Unlike with most agency moves, the company did not issue a request for proposal or hold a competitive review. Domino's spokeswoman said the company would not discuss changes to its ad business and that CPB is still its agency of record. CPB, MDC Partners, and Work in Progress did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Domino's extended its contract with CPB by three years in 2017. But president and chief operating officer Russell Weiner decided to move the account when the contract expires at the end of October because he felt like the quality of work declined after the Work in Progress executives left, according to the knowledgeable source.",F,en,Business Insider

Big tech companies — specifically Google-parent Alphabet, Apple, and Amazon — have their eyes set on the transportation space, which is undergoing a rapid transformation.

These forces have made traditional transportation companies both more vulnerable to challengers and more willing to work with nontraditional players.

Despite the pandemic and market headwinds severely hampering the car industry in 2020, EV sales across the EU have surged just as new emissions standards kicked in at the start of the year, requiring automakers to limit the overall average CO2 output of the cars they sell. The new EU standards have therefore helped push automakers to offer more EV models, with sales expected to make up 10 per cent of the overall car market in 2020, rising to 15 per cent in 2021, according to T&E. If so, it would mark a trebling of the EV market share from three per cent in 2019.

2020-10-10 08:30:00-05:00,The Aston Martin DB11 quietly sources its V8 engine from Mercedes — and it shows how small luxury automakers depend on larger ones to survive,"Summary List Placement It's far more complicated, and more expensive, to manufacture a modern automobile than most of us could ever imagine. This is doubly true for those scratching out an existence at the ultra-luxury margins of the industry, where development costs are rarely ever recouped by volume sales and product decisions have almost zero margin for error should they not connect with the core group of buyers — whose support is key to keeping the lights on. In an automotive industry increasingly driven by consolidation, where not even major operations like Chrysler, Fiat, Nissan, and Mitsubishi can find a path forward without joining together in elaborate networks of takeovers and mergers, smaller concerns have also had to forge similar partnerships lest they be swallowed whole by red ink or a deep-pocketed competitor. Perhaps no vehicle illustrates this better among high-end brands than the 2020 Aston Martin DB11 V8, a respected and stylish grand-touring coupe that'=s looked across the English Channel to pull its entire drivetrain from a most unlikely Continental source.","FCAU,FCA,F",en,Business Insider

Despite a constant cloud of pessimism that continues to surround the company, Tesla has proven that it is in fact capable of turning a profit. What's more, the success Tesla experienced with the Model S, and later the Model X and Model 3, convinced more traditional automakers like Ford and Porsche to take electric vehicles more seriously. One of the cornerstones of Tesla's success has been its steady rollout of new models.

Gavin Newsom announced last week that the state would ban new sales of internal-combustion engines after 2035 , the obvious and immediate reaction was, ""This has to be great news for Tesla!"" And it is great news for America's dominant electric-vehicle manufacturer, which currently makes almost all its cars in the Golden State. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, Tesla was on track to sell nearly 50,000 vehicles in California through the second quarter. A combination of heavily taxed gasoline and perks for zero-emission vehicles has given Left Coasters ample reason to go electric. California accounts for about 11% of all new vehicle sales in the US, so even though the 2035 ICE ban is a long way off — and might not be politically feasible, long term, as it was formulated as an executive order, not legislation — it has the attention of the auto industry.

The power of the Paris Agreement was in the signal that it sent to markets and investors around the world that governments were committed to building net zero emission economies by mid-century. It meant that anyone continuing to bet on a high carbon future was tacitly accusing governments of either being incapable of delivering on their stated goal or engaged in a global conspiracy to deceive the public about their true intentions.

IBM, Microsoft, and unlikely incumbents like Honeywell are all trying to rush to build their own quantum computers — competing against upstarts like Q-CTRL and IonQ.

They’d reached such dizzying heights it was just a matter of time before the thin air got to them. And get to them it did. Some of the mania’s favorites, like Apple, Tesla, and Nvida, fainted in unison…dropping 8 percent, 9 percent, and 9.3 percent, respectively. A company called PagerDuty garnered the honor of the day’s biggest loser. The San Francisco based company, which operates in the cloud, made a graceful 25.8 percent swan dive from its heavenly realm.

Auto policyholders who own a connected car from Ford—the most common manufacturer among Metromile's customer base—will be able to connect their car to Metromile via the car's odometer, eliminating the need to install the Metromile Pulse telematics device typically required to transmit driving data to the insurer. The Ford partnership will expedite Metromile's strategy to integrate behavioral data into its coverage pricing on a wider scale, while also giving it access to a large pool of potential new customers. Metromile's UBI offering is primarily based on mileage, and its application of behavioral data trails competitors.

The $5 billion in new equity the company plans to sell is about twice as much as it has ever issued before (it's an ""at the market"" raise, meaning the shares will be sold over time, at potentially variable prices). The raise should also even out Tesla's cash-to-debt position on its balance sheet, at roughly $14 billion on both sides.

Epps has not yet flown to space, but the St arliner-1 mission could make her the first Black person to live and work aboard the International Space Station for months at a time. NASA previously selected Epps for a 2018 flight, but the agency abruptly removed her from that mission just months ahead of its launch. Epps is one of 16 active female astronauts who may one day land on the moon with NASA's Artemis program. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . NASA astronaut Jeanette Epps may finally be traveling to space. The agency said Tuesday that it has assigned the 49-year-old rookie astronaut to Boeing's Starliner-1 mission, slated to launch sometime in 2021. The mission is actually the second that NASA picked Epps to fly. But she never made the first one, a Russian Soyuz flight that lifted off in June 2018, because the agency abruptly bumped her from the crew about five months ahead of launch. ""I don't know where the decision came from and how it was made, in detail, or at what level,"" Epps said during a 2018 conference , but noted it was not medically related. ""There were Russians, several of them, who defended me in the sense that it's not safe to really remove someone from a crew that has trained together for years."" Despite the disappointing turn of events, Epps, 49, kept her composure over the years. ""Sometimes things don't go the way that you planned,"" she told "" Business Insider Today "" in 2019.

The invention of the internet has played a significant role in enabling this change. The mechanisation of the James Watt era and the assembly line of the Henry Ford era have given way to user-specific product customisation in the age of internet of things. However, the management models of businesses have hardly kept pace with the rapid transformations in manufacturing and service delivery.Since the industrial revolution, business models have been centred around mass production in high-efficiency factory lines with branding at the core of it all. If a company becomes a well-known brand, it is able to make inroads into global markets and set its own prices and command higher profit margins.

Apart from the ban order on Chinese short-video-making app TikTok, US President Donald Trump also issued another similarly-worded executive order against WeChat. ""The WeChat ban could impact up to $28 billion in iPhone/iPad sales in China as well as related impacts to Service revenue,"" reports Seeking Alpha. China is Apple's third largest market where it amassed about $44 billion in net sales in 2019. The ban puts the Chinese market for Apple devices, primarily iPhones and iPads, at high risk if a full crackdown occurs. Apple, along with Ford, Walmart and Disney have called on the Trump administration to end the executive order seeking the ban of WeChat. China is still a very important market for Apple products, as the third largest revenue driver and the second largest contributor to net income on an operating margin basis.

It's still unclear whether the ban applies to the WeChat app only in the United States or if it will result in the removal of the WeChat app from iPhones across the globe. Tencent, which owns WeChat, said it believes the ban applies only in the U.S., but it is seeking clarity. The wording in the executive order is vague, banning any transaction that is related to WeChat, and it is up to the Commerce Department to work out the details. A WeChat ban in the United States has the potential to cause a minor drop in sales, but a WeChat ban in China would be devastating for Apple as many Chinese ‌iPhone‌ users feel their devices would be useless without the WeChat app. In a Weibo survey highlighted by Bloomberg , for example, 95 percent of the 1.2 million people who responded said they would switch to an Android smartphone over an ‌iPhone‌ rather than give up WeChat.",F,en,Mac Rumors

2020-08-03 10:06:33-05:00,Should we treat SUVs like cigarettes and ban advertising?,"New report recommends that outright ban on SUV advertising could help accelerate shift towards cleaner forms of transport The UK should ban the advertising of sports utility vehicles (SUVs) in order to help drive down transport emissions and accelerate progress towards the country's net zero goals, a study published today has urged, drawing parallels with the ban on tobacco advertising and its success in changing behaviours. Produced by climate think tank the New Weather Foundation, the report highlights how average emissions for new cars sold in the UK increased in 2019 for the fourth year in a row. The same trend has documented across much of Europe, as soaring sales for electric vehicles and low emission models are more than offset by increased demand for heavier and more polluting SUVs, which made up four in 10 of the UK's new car sales last year. By contrast, while sales of electric and plug-in hybrid models are growing exponentially they are doing so from a low base with data from the European Environment Agency showing that fewer than two in every 100 new cars are fully electric.",F,en,BusinessGreen

Part of that might be a hedging technique: Rhind also reports enquiries from holders of the Baillie Gifford flagship investment trust, The Scottish Mortgage Trust, which has Tesla as its number one holding at 12.7 per cent of the portfolio. “People might be thinking the share price has gone too far,” Rhind says, but Tesla continues to confound sceptics, despite comments from CEO Elon Musk who commented on the results, saying: “We want to be, like, slightly profitable and maximise growth and make the cars as affordable as possible, and that's what we're trying to achieve.” The company earned a profit of USD104 million during the quarter, compared to a loss of USD408 million for the same quarter a year ago.",F,en,ETF Express
2020-07-23 20:20:34-05:00,Tesla milestone would be EV industry's gain,"The electric vehicle company's stock is soaring, and it could soon be eligible for the S&P 500 Tesla hit a market milestone this week as its stock hovers at epic - and yes, overvalued - heights. The company is Wednesday reported a net income of $110m for its second-quarter earnings , with a net profit of $104m - making it eligible to be listed on the S&P 500, the stock market index of 500 of the largest businesses traded in the United States. The move would be more symbolic for Tesla than it would be financially helpful . Although the potential listing is likely contributing to the stock market surge that's seen Tesla's shares rise from a low of around $360 per share in late March to close to $1,600 per share Monday - that's a crazy run, even for Tesla, one of the most volatile stocks out there (although Tesla's stock actually traded lower Thursday, probably because many analysts had already priced the anticipated earnings into their valuations). But the broader symbolism of an S&P listing would be that an all-electric car company has broken through to the mainstream stock index, which includes big automakers such as Ford and GM, oil companies such as Chevron and Exxon and tech companies such as Apple and Facebook.","F,FB",en,BusinessGreen

Here's how the CEO makes and spends his fortune.,"Advertisers including Verizon, Honda, and Ben & Jerry's are boycotting Facebook over the social network's lack of hate-speech moderation. The boycott is sinking both Facebook's share price and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's net worth. Zuckerberg has a net worth of $82.3 billion , making him the fourth-richest person in the world. Zuckerberg drives an affordable car and wears basic clothes, but appears to splurge on real estate, buying houses and then buying the surrounding properties for privacy. Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan are generous philanthropists, investing billions in childhood education and medical research that they hope will cure all diseases in their children's lifetimes. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. Mark Zuckerberg is a few billion dollars less rich as Facebook's advertiser boycott continues to grow.

Big tech companies — specifically Google-parent Alphabet, Apple, and Amazon — have their eyes set on the transportation space, which is undergoing a rapid transformation.

One such catalyst was the US China trade war. We hedged significantly in 2018 which helped us when the market fell in Q4; we ended the year up over 26 per cent,” says Chung.","EXPR,F",en,Hedgeweek

This has led to several consequences that we have been documenting at length here on Zero Hedge. The main consequence is that auto dealers are losing billions of dollars in fleet sales , which we documented just last week. Fleet sales account for 1.7 million vehicles per year, or about 10% of total U.S. auto sales. Another consequence is that rental car companies have nowhere to store their inventories. Parking lots across the U.S. are full of rental cars, forcing some rental car companies to even rent out the parking lots of unused sports stadiums to store their cars. This, combined with a massive demand drop off, has led to a massive inventory glut for auto dealers, who are being forced to consider major incentives across the board to try and sell vehicles when the consumer makes their way back to the showroom.",F,en,Zero Hedge

Here's why we should all try one on.,"Face masks are being touted as a way to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus around the world, when physical distancing isn't possible. But surgical masks were never really designed to catch or trap viruses, and they're also not as readily available, or easy to clean as face shields, which also provide a lot of protection against spreading virus particles. Here are a few of the best reasons you may want to consider trading in your mask for a clear shield, according to doctors. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . Wearing a mask to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in public has quickly become the norm in cities from New York, to Berlin . In Paris, Mayor Anne Hidalgo has just promised to give out enough free, washable cloth masks for everyone in the city to have one, as the city of lights prepares to reopen. But as people around the world weigh the best ways to slowly move back into public life, a team of three doctors and public health experts from Iowa City is respectfully suggesting that perhaps the shield may be mightier than the mask.

Total EV sales will plunge 43 percent in 2020, according to new research from Wood Mackenzie. The 2020s are the decade in which EVs are expected to move from the margin of the global auto market to its fast lane, as battery pack prices tumble, driving ranges extend, and charging infrastructure becomes more sophisticated and widespread. But the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic shockwaves have not made for a good start. WoodMac now expects global EV sales of 1.3 million units in 2020, nosediving from a record 2.2 million sales last year. Coronavirus deserves much of the blame. In China, the world’s largest EV market, sales of all types of cars fell 21 percent in January compared to last year, and by an eye-watering 80 percent in February. Things were even worse for EVs, with February sales projected to be down more than 90 percent. “Most new EV buyers are still first-time owners of the technology,” Ram Chandrasekaran, principal analyst for transportation and mobility at Wood Mackenzie, said in a research note. “The uncertainty and fear created by the outbreak has made consumers less inclined to adopt a new technology.” “Once the epidemic is contained in China, we suspect consumers will flock back to car dealers and reaffirm their confidence in EVs.” The bounce-back could take longer in Europe and North America, where the COVID-19 outbreak is several months behind China. “The first lockdown in the U.S. did not start until March 20, but the effects have already begun to show in EV sales,” Chandrasekaran said. “General Motors is offering a discount of $10,000 for its Chevrolet Bolt.",F,en,Green Technology

There’s a common misconception in the industry that electric vehicles, having fewer components, in particular moving ones, are easier to design and build and thus, the entry barriers to this market segment are a lot lower than they are for traditional internal combustion engine-powered vehicles. After all, anyone can buy some batteries and motors and connect them up, cooling is super easy so you don’t need any front-facing no air intakes, and braking is simpler because you can turn the electric motor in reverse to assist in decelerating right?

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . ATLANTIC OCEAN — USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78) conducted a successful replenishment-at-sea (RAS) February 8 marking the ship's first time receiving fuel from a replenishment ship in more than 24 months. Ford successfully received more than 1.3 million gallons of fuel, and exercised a solid cargo station, transferring 22 pallets for training from the fleet replenishment oiler USNS Leroy Grumman (T-AO 195), in less than three hours. The RAS started off with Ford pulling alongside Grumman. A few moments later, a line was shot from Ford to Grumman to establish communications and connect to the fuel lines. Once completed, the fuel lines were pulled to Ford to begin the fueling process. ""A RAS is what drives and enhances our mission capabilities,"" said Chief Aviation Boatswain's Mate (Fuels) Joshua Faulds, from Port Washington, Wisconsin, assigned to Ford's V-4 division.

The announcement marks an expansion into the automotive space for Sony, which makes cameras and sound systems for vehicles — but never a car itself. But most importantly, it's further evidence that tech companies are getting increasingly involved in determining what the future of the car looks like. Part of that is due to the rise of self-driving car technology. Carmakers and tech giants are thinking about a future in which cars no longer require a human to be behind the wheel, and they're already competing to occupy your time and attention in the time that may have otherwise been dedicated to driving. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. In a surprise move earlier this week at the CES technology conference, Sony unveiled a prototype smart car called the Vision-S .

In fact, there is now just one OEM that is bigger than Tesla: Germany's carmaking giant Volkswagen (which employs roughly 270,000 workers in Germany alone), and which recently overtook Toyota as the world's largest automaker in terms of sales. So how did Tesla, which about 350,000 cars in 2018, eclipse OEMs which combined have sold about 20 times more cars between them? The answer remains blindingly simple: as S3's Ihor Rusaniwski points out , despite the recent massive short squeeze, Tesla still remains the world's most short automaker (with a couple of tiny exceptions such as BYD, Aston Martin and Nio), and as such what we are seeing now is a slow motion replica of the short squeeze that briefly made Volkswagen the world's most valuable company in 2008, if only for a few hours.",F,en,Zero Hedge

SsangYong’s net losses had more than tripled year on year to about $160 million (185.5 billion won) during the first nine months of 2019. The company has posted operating losses for 11straight quarters now.“We are working with the local management to evaluate all options to generate funds for the company, including support from Korean Development Bank, third party investment and further infusion of equity by Mahindra,” Pawan Goenka, chairman at SsangYong, told ET.This is the first time Goenka, who is also managing director at M&M, has outlined the group's strategic thinking on the issue.Sources said it could be Ford Motor Company — which has formed a joint venture with M&M and would move most of its India assets to the new entity — that comes in as an alliance partner for SsangYong.“At this moment, we are focusing on integrating SsangYong with our alliance partner,” Goenka said. “We feel the right thing for SsangYong is to benefit from the alliance in terms of product and platform sharing, export synergy, cross badging.”Experts said a deal with Ford would ease synergy issues and help SsangYong get a toehold in the US market. “Given the way it is right now, it cannot survive,” said Avik Chattopadhyay, an independent auto consultant. “SsangYong should look at Ford as a global partner and investor.",F,en,The Economic Times India

The customers will see through it and it just becomes a gimmicky thing,” he said.“We will do totally independent products; if you didn’t know it, you wouldn’t know that both products are based on a common architecture. Both companies can retain their own DNA and be differentiated, yet share a lot in common,” he added.For the overseas market, however, the US partner is considering using Mahindra products and re-badge them as Ford to expand its emerging market business, Goenka said.To be sure, attempts at crossbadging by the Volkswagen Group with Vento and the Rapid sedan, or the Renault-Nissan alliance with Duster and Terrano SUV, and the recent effort by Maruti Suzuki and Toyota to rebadge the Baleno hatchback as Toyota Glanza has impacted the individual brands.As product lifecycles shrink and the novelty of new products wane within six months, vehicle makers have had to constantly upgrade and launch new products.Goenka said the JV will help accelerate product launches and plug gaps in its portfolio.It was announced earlier that a ‘C segment’ SUV based on the new generation Mahindra XUV 500 architecture — codenamed W601 — will be shared with Ford, which is internally calling it as W605.",F,en,The Economic Times India

Starting at $39,900, ""Cybertruck"" is inspired by ""Lotus Esprit S1"" from the Bond film ""The Spy Who Loved Me"". The truck will come in three versions with 250 miles, 300 miles and 500 miles of range, respectively. ""Tesla Cybertruck(pressurized edition) will be official truck of Mars. Cybertruck design influenced partly by The Spy Who Loved Me,"" tweeted Musk. According to research firm IHS Markit, the Ford F-150 has been the top-selling pickup truck in the US for more than 40 years, followed by GM's Chevrolet Silverado. Pickup trucks are currently the fastest-growing segment in the US. At the Los Angeles event at the Tesla Design Centre late Thursday, Musk took a dig at Ford, showing a video of a ""tug of war"" between F-150 and the Cybertruck. In June this year, the Tesla CEO said the truck would start at ""less than $50,000,"" putting it between the starting price of the Model 3 (currently $39,400) and the Model S (currently $79,990) sedans.",F,en,Sify.com

Details have been scarce, and analysts are pining for clarity on performance, acceleration, truck-bed and towing capacity, and battery range. Plans, Production, Costs “Another focus of ours will be any commentary about how Tesla plans to produce this new model, with some current models having a lot of similar parts and thus being able to utilize the same production lines/Fremont and Giga, thus we have questions on how/where/if the Cybertruck will fit on the factory production and tooling line,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note. Production will ultimately affect cost — an important factor in comparing the Cybertruck to Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) and General Motors Company (NYSE: GM ) alternatives. Wedbush expects CEO Elon Musk to keep his word about a $50,000 starting price. But peers are skeptical. Credit Suisse noted that battery size impacts margins, and it anticipates a battery cost between $15,000 and $10,000, which is “disproportionately high” for a vehicle of such a low price point.",F,en,Benzinga Feeds

A pedal-to-the-metal dash through the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari and their tussle for dominance at the Le Mans endurance race, the film weathers its two-and-a-half-hour running time easily, even as it navigates a cheerfully formulaic sports movie structure. What soups up the story is a combination of the efficiently executed race sequences (the gear-crunching, tyre-melting sound design deserves plaudits) and a screenplay by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller, which downplays the competition between the two motor companies and instead frames it as a clash between the mavericks and the man.

The fact that investors are holding back because they have spare capacity is an empty tautology. What we need to figure out is why this capacity is spare.It’s best to get a couple of things out of the way at this stage. The claim that demand is somehow ‘saturated’ for a number of products is misleading. Take cars and trucks, the segment worst hit by the current slowdown. A cross-country analysis of vehicle ownership done by HDFC Bank shows that even at its current per-capita income levels, India’s vehicle ownership falls below the curve.So, even if India’s growth were to slow to zero, vehicle ownership should, at least in theory, increase. To put this in context, Brazil and China are over-penetrated.

Industry officials and analysts now expect car demand to slide some 5% this year after a 2.8% fall last year to 28.1 million - its first decline since the 1990s.The slump is exacerbating problems of excess capacity, with factory utilisation rates at China plants for many automakers estimated below break-even point.","FCAU,FCA,F",en,The Economic Times India

Modern business is preoccupied with change, for various reasons — some good and some not so good. Much of the time, well-managed change is a good opportunity to increase profits, but managers need a rationale to embrace the dynamic. The Schumpeterian notion of "" creative destruction "" has always sounded threatening, so many leaders have latched onto the gentler concept of ""disruption,"" theorized by Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen and articulated in his 1997 book ""The Innovator's Dilemma.""

The global autonomous taxi market could be worth over $2 trillion on an annual basis by 2030, according to estimates from UBS analysts cited by Bloomberg. In formulating its estimates, the bank utilized its Evidence Lab to run a simulation of an autonomous taxi fleet in New York City using a ""complex algorithm that performs dynamic optimal route generation and passenger-vehicle assignment considering vehicle capacity and rider demand."" What does this mean: The rise of a new multi-trillion dollar transportation industry will likely reshape how consumers travel and automakers operate. Consumers: The simulation found that riders of autonomous taxis could see the average cost of their trips drop by more than 80%, which would make them cheaper than a metro ticket. Commute times could drop drastically via autonomous taxis: If metropolitan cities like New York converted their existing taxi fleets into autonomous ones, the average commute time could fall from 40 minutes one way to 15 minutes, for one leg of the trip.",F,en,Business Insider

But these conflict minerals, as they’re known, frequently follow a sketchy path from mine to factory, coming from mines whose profits flow to violent militias, criminals, and even terrorists. As human-rights groups step up pressure on big companies to better police the provenance of raw materials in the $600 billion industry, Nathan Williams says he can help. He’s chief executive officer of Minespider, a startup that’s using blockchain, the technology at the heart of Bitcoin, to better track shipments of metals as they move from mines to smelters and then on to factories worldwide.

2019-04-16 08:00:00-05:00,Demand for Cleaner Energy Solutions Grows as Governments Implement EV Guidelines,"NEW YORK , April 16, 2019 /PRNewswire/ --The world is facing a rapid transition from diesel-powered vehicles to electric vehicles (EV). Growing environmental concerns have prompted governments and automotive manufacturers to shift to EVs as a way to combat negative environmental impacts. For instance, the U.S. government offers EV owners a federal tax credit for taking the step towards helping the environment. Moreover, the European Union has implemented regulations in order to limit the amount of diesel-powered vehicles on the road and eventually plans to transition to a fully electric system. A report by the European Environment Agency (EEA) also confirmed that the emission released from EVs are approximately 17% to 30% less than the emissions from petrol and diesel vehicles. The EEA says that EVs are much better for local air quality control due to their zero exhaust emissions at street levels. In addition, EVs are more environmentally efficient because they run on battery packs like lithium-ion battery packs, which are most commonly used within EVs.",F,en,Benzinga

Year-over-year, the total vehicle count grew by 4.6% and has nearly doubled in volume compared to 20 years ago. However, with the rising number of vehicles, the number of accidents has also drastically increased. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) have all compiled extensive research and statistics regarding U.S. accidents. Annually, the economic cost of car accidents in the U.S. is estimated to amount to approximately USD 242 Billion . The staggering number can be a result of car owners looking to repair or even purchase a brand-new vehicle as a result of an accident. The alarming number has also prompted automotive manufacturers to begin conceptualizing autonomous vehicle models as national governments believe the rapid production of autonomous vehicles will help reduce the number of car accidents by eliminating human error.",F,en,Benzinga

That was the message delivered during a ""tense"" conference call between the Trump administration and executives in the auto industry, according to Bloomberg , which also included senior officials from the EPA and the NHTSA. The call, which took place in late February, came after Trump's administration had repeatedly terminated talks between federal regulators and California officials in an attempt to maintain a common emission standard across the industry. Executives in the industry have been urging the two sides to reach an agreement to avoid a legal battle with California, which is in the unique position of being able to establish its own standards. The call to automakers came after the White House admitted that months of talks with the California Air Resources Board had failed. The White House said in late February: “Despite the administration’s best efforts to reach a common-sense solution, it is time to acknowledge that CARB has failed to put forward a productive alternative.” CARB spokesman Stanley Young disputed this, saying the administration had broken off talks ""and never responded to our suggested areas of compromise - or offered any compromise proposal at all.""

Layoffs recently ""quietly begun"", according to additional reporting from Reuters.

Car sales in China continued their relentless descent in January, falling 17.7%, as we recently expected would happen when discussing Europe's tumbling January auto sales.

But there's no obvious reason to panic - at least, not yet. In a statement, Ford claimed that the problems didn't involve ""defeat devices"" like those Volkswagen admitted were deliberately installed in its cars to circumvent federal regulations - a scandal that resulted in billions of dollars in fines and mass recalls. Some of the company's executives even faced criminal charges. Ford also said none of its fuel economy ratings had been found to be inaccurate (again, at least not yet).",F,en,Zero Hedge

Hundreds of Chinese companies issued profit warnings, telling their investors that earnings for the full year were going to be below expectations, according to Bloomberg . No less than 440 zombie companies disclosed the bad news on Wednesday, still one day before the deadline for such disclosures. The companies cited the country's economic slowdown (which is also catalyzing sales of Chinese-held U.S. real estate), as well as recent accounting changes that followed a $2.3 trillion equity market selloff last year. The change is stunning: out of more than 2400 mainland listed companies, 373 have said they're going to post a loss - and what's more concerning, 86% of those companies were profitable in 2017. There may be more bad news on the way: Thursday is the official deadline for companies to disclose whether or not they expect ""substantial changes"" in their financial results, so expect even more guidance cuts.",F,en,Zero Hedge
