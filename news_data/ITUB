2020-12-07 11:39:40-05:00,"Movimento positivo dos mercados não é bolha, diz Mesquita, do Itaú","Fundamento para isso é a perspectiva de retomada econômica em ambiente de juros globais baixos, disse na Live do Valor O movimento positivo dos mercados financeiros tem fundamentos e embute a perspectiva de retomada econômica em um ambiente de juros globais baixos, na avaliação de Mario Mesquita, economista-chefe do Itaú Unibanco. “Não acho que se trate de uma bolha. O fundamento é a expectativa de recuperação da economia, que a maioria dos analistas considera que irá gerar poucas pressões inflacionárias, em especial nas economias maduras”, disse na Live do Valor desta segunda-feira. O Fed [Federal Reserve, o banco central americano] sinalizou que a taxa de juros não subirá tão cedo, ao mesmo tempo em que o Banco Central Europeu (BCE) não só mantém as taxas de juros em terreno negativo, mas também deve injetar ainda mais estímulos na economia. Esse movimento deve gerar uma busca por retornos mais elevados, com maior apetite por risco, observou Mesquita. A combinação entre crescimento econômico com poucas pressões de preços e juros baixos significa um mercado mais otimista, o que tende a atrair capitais para mercados emergentes, como o Brasil, apontou ele.",ITUB,pt,Valor Econômico
2020-12-07 10:59:51-05:00,"Política monetária deve operar sob pressão em grande parte de 2021, diz Mesquita","Inflação elevada e montante de vencimentos de títulos públicos no segundo trimestre são duas fontes de preocupação para o BC, apontou na Live do Valor O Banco Central deve voltar a elevar a Selic somente no fim de 2021, mas a política monetária vai operar sob pressão em boa parte do próximo ano, na avaliação de Mario Mesquita, economista-chefe do Itaú Unibanco. Na Live do Valor desta segunda-feira, Mesquita afirmou que duas “corcovas” devem ser fonte de preocupação para o BC no primeiro semestre: a inflação medida pelo IPCA, que vai seguir elevada e deve chegar a 6% nos 12 meses até maio, e um montante importante de vencimentos de títulos públicos no segundo trimestre. Mortes diárias por covid perto de mil tirariam 0,4 ponto de crescimento ao mês, diz Mesquita Nas estimativas do Itaú, disse Mesquita, o indicador oficial de inflação vai chegar a maio com alta de 5,7% na medida anual — bastante acima da meta perseguida para 2021, de 3,75%. “Quando isso acontece, a ancoragem das expectativas de inflação passa por um teste.",ITUB,pt,Valor Econômico
