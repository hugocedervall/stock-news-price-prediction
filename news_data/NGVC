2019-12-10 11:37:58-05:00,Whole Foods is selling dangerous anti-vaccine propaganda in its checkout aisles,"Whole Foods checkout aisles around the country have sold magazines that promote anti-vaccine talking points. One article, adapted from a defunct anti-vaccine website, is literally titled ""MMR Vaccine Causes Autism."" These magazines are also a symptom of a much larger problem: an anti-vaccine movement helped along by social platforms and powerful allies. Representatives for the grocery chain and its parent company Amazon didn't return multiple requests for comment. Visit Insider's homepage for more stories. More than any other major grocery store, Whole Foods has made healthy living central to its brand. Based on the Amazon-owned supermarket's tremendous popularity , it's a strategy that has worked. If you look past the colorful organic produce displays and sustainably-sourced seafood counter, however, you'll start to notice incongruities. There's nothing particularly healthful, for instance, about the homeopathy aisle — a section of Whole Foods' Whole Body Department that sells 19th century pseudoscience masquerading as cold and flu remedies — or the shelves filled with supplements and probiotics making claims that often don't hold up to scientific scrutiny.",NGVC,en,Business Insider
