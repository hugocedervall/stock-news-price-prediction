And while there wasn't much discrepancy among patients' satisfaction with specific vendors, Amwell came out on top with a score of 885—that's compared with MDLive, for instance, which earned a score of 843. Patients have been swarming to telehealth amid the pandemic—and telehealth vendors have responded by diversifying their offerings to win over customers and keep them happy. Thirty-six percent of US adults tried telehealth as of August 2020—a sharp increase from the 11% who used it pre-pandemic in January, according to CivicScience. And now we've seen top vendors diversify solutions to appeal to different pockets of the market: For instance, Doctor on Demand extended its service to Medicare beneficiaries in May before its prime competitors—giving itself a chance to corner off this segment of consumers and build out services to meet their needs.","AMWL,ANTM",en,Business Insider

2020-09-30 08:03:00-05:00,The Apple Watch's abnormal pulse readings are steering users to emergency rooms unnecessarily,"Summary List Placement A retrospective study conducted by physicians and researchers at the Mayo Clinic revealed that out of 264 patients who received an abnormal pulse detection using their Apple Watch, only 30 patients (11%) actually received cardiovascular diagnosis after visiting their provider—suggesting the Watch is churning a high number of false positive results with this feature. For context, the Watch's pulse feature is separate from its electrocardiogram (ECG) tool, which earned FDA approval in 2018. We think an uptick in Watch-generated avoidable patient visits will likely deter more healthcare institutions from striking deals with Apple. It's no secret that the tech giant has been using its Watch to push deeper into the healthcare arena: For one, it rolled out a blood oxygen measurement tool with its Series 6 Watch debut earlier this month, and is collaborating with UC Irvine and Anthem to test how blood oxygen measurement can help manage asthma. However, it might be difficult for Apple to leverage its Watch to broaden its roster of long-term health partners if it's doling out false positives: US consumers already cost the health system a whopping $200 billion annually in unnecessary tests and treatments, and healthcare entities are going to look for ways to mitigate—not compound—these sky-high costs.",ANTM,en,Business Insider

Without widespread testing, it’s a daunting task to identify contagious individuals and isolate them.To help meet that challenge, the XPRIZE Foundation, which aims to spur technological and industry advancements, is offering a $5 million prize to develop a new Covid-19 rapid test. Competitors can enter until midnight Tuesday. Since July, 659 teams from 68 countries have registered.Currently, test results for the novel coronavirus can take up to two weeks, creating headaches for medical professionals, public-health experts and elected officials. Without the ability to test people often and with speedy results, many cases may go undetected, which can lead to new clusters of infections.“We have, like everyone else around the globe, seen the impact this has had on mental health, physical health, bringing the wheels off of the economy,” said Anousheh Ansari, chief executive officer of the XPRIZE Foundation. “We always look at innovation to solve grand challenges.”Ansari and her family poured millions into funding the first XPRIZE in 2004 that launched the commercial space race.","AMZN,ANTM",en,Economic Times India

A couple also feature virtual try-on options so you really never have to step into a physical store again.

While telehealth has been on the brink of taking off for years, consumer usage of the tech ticked up slowly before 2020.

US insurer Anthem reported an impressive $24 billion in operating revenue in Q1 2019, up 9% year-over-year (YoY) from $22 billion in 2018, thanks to the addition of over 1 million new members. Anthem's revenue hike comes as the payer gears up to launch a proprietary primary benefit manager (PBM), dubbed IngenioRx . The payer will start transferring members to its PBM at the beginning of May, per Forbes. For context, PBMs are the middlemen of the pharmaceutical industry, responsible for negotiating the costs of drugs for health plans. Here's what it means: Anthem's move into the PBM market could be lucrative — and its sheer size could be a massive aid in kicking off the initiative. The US PBM market is worth around $423 billion , offering Anthem a ripe revenue opportunity. And as the second largest US insurer — Anthem counted nearly 41 million members as of Q1 2019 — Anthem has ample traffic to funnel through IngenioRx, which could help get its fledgling PBM off the ground.",ANTM,en,Business Insider

2019-03-26 09:31:09-05:00,Health insurance stocks fall after DOJ agrees with Texas court that ACA is unconstitutional,"Health insurance stocks slid on Tuesday after the Justice Department said it stood with a Texas district court's December ruling that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional, essentially agreeing that the entire law should be struck down. Shares of companies with heavier exposure to Medicaid were in the lead, with Molina Healthcare, Inc. shares falling 6.6%, Centene Corporation shares falling 2% and WellCare Health Plans Inc. shares slipping 1.8%. Shares of more diversified, large-cap companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated , Cigna Corporation , Humana Inc. and Anthem Inc. slipped as well. ""The space could see continued weakness on the back of the DOJ brief,"" Jefferies health-care trader Jared Holz told MarketWatch in an email. He said he thinks an actual law change would be unlikely, since that would require support from both the House and the Senate. ""The greater significance here near-term could be additional headline risk adding to an already tenuous ground for insurers,"" he said.",ANTM,en,MarketWatch

2019-03-19 08:55:49-05:00,A new game set in the ruins of Washington D.C. is a best-in-class shooter than puts 'Anthem' to shame,"""The Division 2"" is available now on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC. The third-person loot-shooter is set in Washington D.C., in the wake of a pandemic wiping out much of society. From storytelling to gameplay, ""The Division 2"" distinguishes itself from the competition — especially compared to 2019's biggest flop, ""Anthem."" There's no getting around it: ""The Division 2"" stands out as an especially good game because of a very similar, significantly less good game that just launched. That game is ""Anthem,"" of course — the long-hyped loot-shooter from EA's BioWare studio. By most considerations, ""Anthem"" is a bit of a mess . ""The Division 2,"" however, is a polished, rich game that's part of the same genre occupied by ""Anthem"" and ""Destiny 2."" And it's specifically because of the genre it belongs to that ""The Division 2"" stands out as especially good.
