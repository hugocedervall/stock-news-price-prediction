And this is unlikely to be a blip. This rotation from growth stocks into value investments has 'legs', according to a note from JP Morgan Casenove, who have combed through the stocks universe in Europe - which has seen over a quarter of a million deaths from the virus - to find their top picks that could profit from this reversal.

Subscribe today to receive industry-changing digital health news and analysis to your inbox. A new class of medicine — digital therapeutics (DTx) — has emerged, offering a novel means of treating the swelling number of patients with chronic diseases and keeping associated costs down. Digital therapeutics deliver evidence-based therapies via software — often in the form of consumer-facing mobile health apps — that replace or complement the existing treatment of a disease. They diverge from the broader digital health market in that they must be approved by regulatory bodies — and displaying proof-of-concept is at the core of their model. DTx vendors leverage their tech to treat chronic conditions, which gobble up the lion's share of the US' healthcare spending: Business Insider Intelligence estimates that the US shelled out up to $3.3 trillion on chronic disease in 2018.","NVS,NVO",en,Business Insider

The Governor signed it into law and now Illinois residents are protected from price gouging on this critical medication. You would think that every single state legislator would have voted yes on this bill. And you would almost be right. It passed with strong support from both Democrats and Republicans. Our local Republican State Rep. Tom Demmer, voted no and our local Republican State Sen. Brian Stewart did not vote at all on this issue. Wonder why? Check out who donates to their campaigns. You'll find big pharmaceutical companies generously support them.

The milestone means the company has delivered on its 100 per cent renewable power goal, which was set in 2015 when Novo Nordisk joined The Climate Group's RE100 initiative and committed to ensure all its plants would be powered by renewable electricity by 2020. Having reached the renewables goal, the firm announced it will now pursue a new target to achieve zero CO2 emissions from all operations and transport by 2030. As such, Novo Nordisk has become the latest corporate to join The Climate Group's EV100 initiative, which sees firms commit to switching to a zero emission fleet. The ambitious goals are part of the firm's new Circular for Zero environmental strategy, which aims to make Novo Nordisk a company which has zero environmental impact, through minimised consumption, recycling or reusing of all its waste, and working with suppliers to build circularity into its supply chain, including through procumerement of recycled and carbon-neutral materials and resources. ""More than 30 million people use our medicines and now they can do so knowing that they're produced using renewable electricity,"" said Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen, president and CEO at Novo Nordisk. ""By committing to achieve zero emissions across our operations and transport by 2030 and by applying a circular mindset across our entire business, we are working towards a day when we will be able to say that Novo Nordisk is a company with zero environmental impact.""

2020-06-25 13:31:01-05:00,Can India really take China's place as the next factory to the world?,"By Abheek BaruaIndia’s de facto industrial policy wants to chase three objectives — self-reliance, the need to grab a larger share of the global value chain (GVC), and a reduction in the economy’s dependence on China. To be successful, it must take into account the altered global economic landscape that is likely to emerge in the post-Covid-19 era. It also needs to ponder over the many advantages of incumbency that China enjoys having been the ‘mother factory’ of the world for almost three decades. Take the aspirations of gaining a bigger foothold in the global supply chain (GSC) if manufacturers, particularly in the west, diversify away from China to de-risk production from ‘shocks’ like Covid-19. So, if they indeed want to cut risk, where do they go? Supply chain expert Willy Shih of Harvard Business School makes a compelling case for ‘localisation’ in a March 2020 article (bit.ly/3dwPxWK) — that is, having suppliers physically close to the parent factory.

A new class of medicine — digital therapeutics (DTx) — has emerged, offering a novel means of treating the swelling number of patients with chronic diseases and keeping associated costs down. Digital therapeutics deliver evidence-based therapies via software — often in the form of consumer-facing mobile health apps — that replace or complement the existing treatment of a disease. They diverge from the broader digital health market in that they must be approved by regulatory bodies — and displaying proof-of-concept is at the core of their model.

The same goes for platinum, which fell to a 17-year low before regaining half its losses, and copper, which hit a 4-year low before bouncing back. In the wake of the pandemic’s first wave, some mining companies have fared better than others. Companies with mining operations in South America and West Africa like New Pacific Metals Corp. (OTCQX: NUPMF ) and Endeavour Mining Corp. (OTCQX: EDVMF ) have regained the majority of their losses. Others have not been so lucky.

Some people are dying because they can't afford the life-saving drug. In the last decade, the list prices of common types of insulin have roughly tripled, even though they're the exact same products offered 10 years ago. In 2009, the list price for a 10-milliliter vial of Humalog, a fast-acting insulin made by Eli Lilly, was about $93. Today it costs closer to $275. Similarly, Novo Nordisk's fast-acting insulin Novolog cost almost $93 for a 10-milliliter vial in 2009. Today, it costs about $290. The prices of Humalog and Novolog have essentially increased in lockstep . We've seen similar price hikes for Lantus, a common long-acting insulin made by Sanofi, and long-acting Levemir, also made by Novo Nordisk. Insulin manufacturers are facing mounting pressure to lower their list prices. Last year, the Minnesota attorney general filed a lawsuit against the big three insulin makers for alleged price gouging, and in February, Maryland Congressman Elijah Cummings and Vermont Sen.",NVO,en,Business Insider
