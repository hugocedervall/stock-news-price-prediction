Between becoming the first company to launch an autonomous ride-hailing service in the US and landing partnerships with automakers like Fiat Chrysler and Daimler, the Google spinoff has rolled by a number of milestones in recent years. But staying ahead requires top talent, and in a hotly contested space, that often means paying top dollar. Business Insider looked at data the company shared with the US government to get a sense of how much it pays its employees. The US Office of Foreign Labor Certification requires companies to disclose compensation for permanent and temporary employees from outside the US to ensure the firms aren't paying them less than the average wage earned by their peers. The data Business Insider analyzed is from 2020 and represents an average among some of the employees included in Waymo's disclosures. A Waymo representative said the salary data shared with the US Office of Foreign Labor Certification is not reflective of the average compensation at the company since employees recruited from abroad tend to be less experienced than their coworkers.",FCAU,en,Business Insider

2020-11-28 09:43:22-05:00,Winning the electric car race is just the beginning of Elon Musk's plan for Tesla (TSLA),"Summary List Placement The idea that automakers are racing to commercialize electric cars — and that one or some of them will come out on top — has always been flawed. For starters, the auto industry is huge: More than a billion passenger vehicles are roaming the planet, with another 80 million or so joining them every year. No single victor could satisfy that level of demand. This was obvious even in the early days of the auto industry, when scores of carmakers, engine-makers, and coachbuilders were competing to put Americans and Europeans behind the wheel. Yes, there were obvious winners and losers: Henry Ford captured a huge amount of market share early on with his Model T, then General Motors grew itself into a competitor and took the lead. But more than a century on, both are carrying on, more or less fine. That's not how races work. In the 20th century, plenty of other famous names got in on the action. Vanished marques, such as Studebaker and Nash. Mid-century upstarts like Chrysler.","FCAU,FCA",en,Business Insider

The first phase of the partnership nnounced yesterday will see the two firms use Kaluza's software platform to develop a smart charging service for Fiat 500 EV drivers. Leveraging live data from local grid operators, Kaluza said its platform aimed to help EV batteries charge up at times when carbon intensity is lowest on the grid - and electricity is therefore cheapest - without the need for a separate smart charge point. Fiat said the innovation, which is being tested in the UK, would enable its drivers to benefit from reduced bills, lower carbon emissions and a ""seamless"" in-app charging experience. A select group of Fiat customers in the UK will be invited to trial the service during the first half of 2021, the firm said. ""The agreement with Kaluza to explore smart charging technologies represents an excellent opportunity to reduce vehicles' charging costs and subsequently the total cost of ownership,"" said Fiat e-mobility chief Roberto di Stefano. ""Furthermore, this innovation will allow our Fiat 500 EV customers to experience the benefits without the need to install specific charging equipment."" It is just the latest auto partnership for Kaluza, which last month announced a similar project alongside German multinational Bosch to trial direct-to-car smart charging.","FCAU,FCA",en,BusinessGreen

Fiat Chrysler had already reached an agreement to pool its fleet with Tesla’s.European Union rules that took effect this year force manufacturers to reduce the average emissions of the fleet of cars they sell in the region to 95 grams of CO2 per kilometer, or face hefty fines. As a result, companies have been introducing new plug-in hybrid and fully electric models, and those that are at risk of falling short of compliance have paired up with peers who are better positioned.Last week, Volvo Cars announced it will overachieve in meeting the regulations and allow Ford Motor Co. to pool with its fleet for an undisclosed sum.

Der deutsche Volkswagen-Konzern geht dank des starken China-Geschäfts, voller Auftragsbücher und eines nach wie vor hohen Sparpotenzials vorsichtig optimistisch in die letzten Monate des Jahres. ""Wir rechnen damit, dass sich die Erholung im vierten Quartal fortsetzt und es zu keinen Lockdowns in größeren Märkten kommt"", sagte Finanzvorstand Frank Witter am Donnerstag bei Präsentation der Quartalsbilanz. Wie zuvor Daimler und andere Hersteller schaffte der weltgrößte Autobauer aus Wolfsburg im Zeitraum Juli bis September die Rückkehr in die Gewinnzone - und trat dabei weniger stark auf die Kostenbremse als andere. Der Betriebsgewinn war mit 3,2 Milliarden Euro um ein Drittel niedriger als im Vorjahreszeitraum, war aber höher als Analysten erwartet hatten. Die VW-Aktien legten in der Spitze um 3,2 Prozent zu, danach bröckelte der Kurs etwas. Auch von anderen Autobauern waren zuletzt positive Signale gekommen, weil sich die Nachfrage seit dem Lockdown im Frühjahr erholt hat und das Geschäft auf dem weltgrößten Pkw-Markt in China wieder brummt.","FCAU,FCA",de,KURIER Medienhaus

VW's return to profitability came amid a spike in coronavirus cases in Europe that prompted the French and German governments to order their countries back into strict national lockdowns on Wednesday. ""The coronavirus remains a central problem,"" VW's chief financial officer, Frank Witter, said in a conference call with reporters. ""This situation now is anything but relaxed."" The German carmaker reiterated it expects to post a profit for the full year, saying that its business ""recovered noticeably"" in the quarter as sales in China of its premium vehicles, including Audi and Porsche sports cars, rose 3%. Due to market volatility the carmaker would not issue a more specific full-year profit forecast, Witter said. During the third quarter, VW's performance was aided by a series of cost-cutting measures launched earlier this year.","FCAU,FCA",en,Business Insider

2020-10-10 08:30:00-05:00,The Aston Martin DB11 quietly sources its V8 engine from Mercedes — and it shows how small luxury automakers depend on larger ones to survive,"Summary List Placement It's far more complicated, and more expensive, to manufacture a modern automobile than most of us could ever imagine. This is doubly true for those scratching out an existence at the ultra-luxury margins of the industry, where development costs are rarely ever recouped by volume sales and product decisions have almost zero margin for error should they not connect with the core group of buyers — whose support is key to keeping the lights on. In an automotive industry increasingly driven by consolidation, where not even major operations like Chrysler, Fiat, Nissan, and Mitsubishi can find a path forward without joining together in elaborate networks of takeovers and mergers, smaller concerns have also had to forge similar partnerships lest they be swallowed whole by red ink or a deep-pocketed competitor. Perhaps no vehicle illustrates this better among high-end brands than the 2020 Aston Martin DB11 V8, a respected and stylish grand-touring coupe that'=s looked across the English Channel to pull its entire drivetrain from a most unlikely Continental source.","FCAU,FCA,F",en,Business Insider

In brief Money laundering via cryptocurrencies is not a preferred tool for criminals, a report said. Traditional methods like mules, cash businesses, and drug trade remain at the forefront. However, private cryptocurrencies and online marketplaces are an upcoming threat. According to a report by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), the role of cryptocurrencies in money laundering is overstated and unfounded, with fiat money still the most used method for such illicit purposes. Money laundering remains a grave concern globally. Research from the intergovernmental organization United Nations suggests anything from $800 billion to $2 trillion is laundered via fiat channels each year.","FCAU,FCA",en,Zero Hedge

The same story can be repeated over and over again with manufacturers like Ford, Volkswagen, BMW, Toyota, and Nissan. On the other hand are the new players, such as Tesla, which has seen a 500% surge in its own stock price since mid-March, while startups like Nikola Motors are being rewarded with market cap numbers in some cases approaching those of legacy automakers — even though they've yet to build a single vehicle.","FCAU,FCA",en,Business Insider

In 2015, the crypto world was introduced to Ethereum, the first major blockchain protocol to include significant smart contract functionality. Smart contracts let Ethereum developers build decentralized applications (“DApps”) that could execute complex transactions on top of a decentralized blockchain network. DApps use their tokens less like cash analogues and more like gas in an engine, charging transaction fees for developers and users to access the application. Since 2015, the number of DApps, according to tracking website State of the DApps , has seen massive growth from 24 registered DApps in April 2015 to over 3500 by June 2020. DApps and “electronic cash” are two of the most significant models for blockchain-based cryptocurrency, and many experts believe that they’re not inherently contradictory use cases. crypto users with access to a wide range of tokens can utilize a diverse range of specialized DApps while also using appropriate tokens as “electronic cash” in transactions and purchases.","FCAU,FCA",en,Benzinga Feeds

Britain’s economy has returned to growth for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic forced the country to lock down. But it’s still a quarter smaller than three months ago. UK GDP rose by 1.8% in May, according to data just released by the latest estimate from the Office for National Statistics. That follows the record slump of 20.3% in April, and a 6.9% decline in March. “Manufacturing and house building showed signs of recovery as some businesses saw staff return to work. Despite this, the economy was still a quarter smaller in May than in February, before the full effects of the pandemic struck. In the important services sector, we saw some pickup in retail, which saw record online sales. However, with lockdown restrictions remaining in place, many other services remained in the doldrums, with a number of areas seeing further declines.” European Opening Calls: #FTSE 6100 -1.23% #DAX 12575 -1.76% #CAC 4972 -1.68% #AEX 571 -1.38% #MIB 19706 -1.49% #IBEX 7336 -1.23% #OMX 1719 -1.34% #STOXX 3293 -1.70% #IGOpeningCall Quite an intra-session reversal for #US #stocks After significant early gains, the #Dow ended flat while the S&P and #NASDAQ closed 0.9-2.1% lower.","FCAU,FCA",en,The Guardian

Big tech companies — specifically Google-parent Alphabet, Apple, and Amazon — have their eyes set on the transportation space, which is undergoing a rapid transformation. Across the globe, legacy transportation firms are contending with forces that are reducing the appeal of traditional gas-powered vehicles, including the rise of mobility companies like Uber and Lime, regulatory pushes for cleaner vehicles, and consumer demands for a more streamlined, digital in-car experience. These forces have made traditional transportation companies both more vulnerable to challengers and more willing to work with nontraditional players. Having already shown an ability to disrupt traditional industries by rapidly innovating, creating best-in-class user experiences, and earning the loyalty of consumers across the globe, big tech now appears poised to propel the transportation industry into a new era.","FCA,FCAU,F",en,Business Insider

One of the core narratives of Bitcoin ( BTC ) since inception is the oft-stated goal of separating money and state. While this has certainly been a powerful creed in the currency’s early adoption by the crypto-anarchist and techno-libertarian communities, what does this actually mean? It’s quite simply a call for a neutral form of money. When stripped of the more political messaging, Bitcoin is fundamentally the introduction of a credibly neutral, global system of value transfer that is open and permissionless yet cryptographically secure and verifiable. This burgeoning crypto economy is still relatively early in its development, yet in the ten-plus years since its launch, it has fundamentally shifted the discourse around what money could or ought to become in the future. Bitcoin’s third halving on May 11, a 50% reduction in the BTC block subsidy that rewards miners for validating transactions and securing the network, represents a clear distinction between fiat monetary systems governed by whim and crypto monetary systems executed through software.","FCA,FCAU",en,Cointelegraph

2020-05-19 08:00:00-05:00,Largest Private Investment Bank in Latin America Issues Real Estate Tokens on Tezos,"Banco BTG Pactual, the largest private investment bank in Latin America is moving some of its real estate-backed security tokens over to the Tezos blockchain. Banco BTG Pactual is issuing its security tokens representing investment in real estate on the Tezos ( XTZ ) blockchain. Previously, the bank had issued its ReitBZ tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, raising $10 million in Ether ( ETH ) and Gemini Dollars ( GUSD ). Which blockchain will prevail in the future? Andre Portilho, head of digital assets at BTG Pactual, told Cointelegraph that $5 million worth of ReitBZ will be switched to Tezos, including the $2.5 million new raise that was conducted in fiat. The reason behind this diversification is that the bank wants to have its options open, as there is no way of telling which blockchain will prevail in the long run: “We don't want to be tied to just one blockchain. Because clearly I cannot tell which blockchain blockchain will prevail. We want to have other options, other blockchains that might serve better the pieces of tokenization and issuing tokens that represent real assets.” Comparing the cost of the digital asset issuance versus the traditional paper approach, Portilho noted that the former might have turned out to be a little bit more expensive, but it provides certain advantages and infinite scalability — issuing $10 billion worth of securities will cost roughly the same as $10 million.","FCA,FCAU",en,Cointelegraph

Binance founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao, otherwise known as CZ, believes that the African continent holds some unique opportunities for cryptocurrency adoption and development. The Binance leader provided a number of interesting insights during an exclusive “ask me anything” session hosted on Zoom for key members of the African cryptocurrency community, which Cointelegraph participated in. Binance, which has established itself as the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trade volume, has slowly been opening up satellite trading platforms in a number of African countries. Uganda was the first country to welcome Binance to the continent in 2018. Binance has since launched trading support in countries such as Nigeria and most recently South Africa , which included the provision of trading pairs and fiat deposits for users using South African rands. The company’s foray into the African continent began in earnest in 2018, as CZ explained during the AMA. “Even from the first day when Binance launched, we had users from Africa, and they were actually relatively active.","FCA,FCAU",en,Cointelegraph

This has led to several consequences that we have been documenting at length here on Zero Hedge. The main consequence is that auto dealers are losing billions of dollars in fleet sales , which we documented just last week. Fleet sales account for 1.7 million vehicles per year, or about 10% of total U.S. auto sales. Another consequence is that rental car companies have nowhere to store their inventories. Parking lots across the U.S. are full of rental cars, forcing some rental car companies to even rent out the parking lots of unused sports stadiums to store their cars. This, combined with a massive demand drop off, has led to a massive inventory glut for auto dealers, who are being forced to consider major incentives across the board to try and sell vehicles when the consumer makes their way back to the showroom.","FCA,FCAU",en,Zero Hedge

2020-05-07 16:26:53-05:00,Watch the Jeep Wrangler roll over in 2 different crashes that could put passengers at risk of 'complete or partial ejection',"The four-door Jeep Wrangler tipped over twice in crash testing, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety said on Thursday. The test was the driver-side small front overlap, in which vehicles often do not tip over. Due to that, the IIHS gave the Wrangler its second-lowest rating in that particular category. The IIHS said the Wrangler did well by normal test metrics, which generally measure how well the driver's survival space within the vehicle holds up. But a vehicle tipping over is ""not an acceptable outcome"" and even partial rollovers ""are especially dangerous in crashes,"" the IIHS said. In a statement to Business Insider, Jeep's owner Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) said it has ""produced more than 500,000 of these vehicles"" and is ""unaware of any incidents that correlate"" with the IIHS result.

A new fiat-crypto exchange has launched in India, two months after lifting the country’s stringent ban on banks’ dealings with crypto businesses. The Bangalore-headquartered exchange, dubbed BitPolo, went live on May 6. It was originally founded in March; the same month the Supreme Court ruled against the central bank’s longstanding moratorium on crypto-related banking support. BitPolo supports Rupee (INR) deposits and withdrawals, and crypto-fiat pairs with major currencies such as Bitcoin ( BTC ). In a statement accompanying the launch, Bitpolo chief business officer, Suresh Choudhary, said the exchange team had been building throughout the bear market and considers that the platform’s launch, mid-lockdown , comes at an apposite time: “The world is slowly inching back towards normalcy post a pandemic and recessionary environment. As we foresee fragilities of traditional asset classes, crypto markets seem to offer the bigger upside.” Echoing these comments, head of strategy, Chandan Choudhury, argued that “COVID-19 is an eye-opener,” which has exposed the “huge bubble across traditional asset classes fuelled by loose monetary policy.” Crypto trading volumes surge on veteran exchange WazirX In correspondence with Cointelegraph, Nischal Shetty, founder and CEO of the well-known Indian exchange, WazirX , revealed that the platform witnessed a month-on-month growth of over 80% in both March and April.","FCA,FCAU",en,Cointelegraph

As social distancing increases, markets continue to fall. So, by looking at the expected breakout levels of the virus, we can assess possible market reactions. The chart below shows the inverse correlation between the expected peaks of the virus and potential lows in the markets: Source: FIPhysician – & Patrick Hill – 3/18/20 In the COVID-19 – SPX model above, the steep red line is a forecast of new cases if social distancing were not in place.

The impact on the rest of the world of the disease’s dislocation of the Chinese economy is yet to be fully felt. Forecasts of only a modest impact on oil demand worldwide are far too optimistic. A comparison of the latest forecasts from the world’s three big oil agencies - the International Energy Agency, the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries - highlights the huge uncertainty that exists over the virus’s repercussions for oil demand. As may be expected for a body representing oil producers, OPEC sees the impact as minimal, having just cut its first-quarter forecast for global oil demand by only 400,000 barrels a day. That looks like wishful thinking. The IEA’s revision is three times as big, and if its forecast bears out, it’s deep enough to tip the world into its first year-on-year drop in demand in more than a decade.","FCA,FCAU",en,Zero Hedge
2020-02-17 23:29:28-05:00,Apple sales to fall short of target due to coronavirus,"Apple Inc warned on Monday it was unlikely to meet a sales target set just three weeks ago amid lost production and weakening demand in China from the coronavirus outbreak. The illness has killed 1,770 in China and stricken some 70,500 people, with millions of others confined to their homes and factories slow to reopen after the Chinese New Year holiday break was extended due to the virus. Manufacturing facilities in China that produce Apple's iPhone and other electronics have begun to reopen, but they are ramping up more slowly than expected, Apple said. That will mean fewer iPhones available for sale around the world, making Apple one of the largest Western firms to be hurt by the outbreak. Some of its retail stores in the country remain closed or are operating at reduced hours, which will hurt sales this quarter. China accounted for 15% of Apple's revenue, or $13.6 billion, last quarter, and supplied 18% of revenue in the year-ago quarter. In late January, Apple had forecast $63 billion to $67 billion in revenue for the quarter ending in March.","FCA,FCAU",en,The Economic Times India

2020-01-28 09:47:23-05:00,Why Is It So Hard to Buy an Electric Car in Many Parts of America?,"Cue the handwringing: U.S. plug-in electric vehicle sales in 2019 (329,528) declined by 9 percent compared to 2018 (361,307). There’s plenty of blame to go around: relatively cheap gas, expiring federal EV tax credits for Tesla and GM, the dearth of available electric trucks and SUVs, higher upfront costs compared to conventional vehicles. But the auto industry is itself partially to blame for last year’s stagnant market. Despite automakers’ frequent pronouncements proclaiming electric vehicles as the future of mobility, they haven’t fully deployed their considerable resources to market and sell EVs. How can one conclude Americans aren’t interested in EVs when automakers barely advertise them, dealers sparingly stock them, and many salespeople remain indifferent if not hostile to selling them? Results from a recently published Sierra Club report confirm the dismal state of the EV buying experience in the United States ( PDF ). In a first-of-its-kind survey, nearly 600 volunteers visited more than 900 auto dealerships and stores across all 50 states and found that 74 percent of dealerships do not have a single EV on their lot for sale.","FCA,FCAU",en,Green Technology

BMW sold 35,746 cars and SUVs in the month of December, finishing the year ahead of Mercedes by more than 8.700 units. The company's revival in the U.S. can be attributed to filling out its SUV lineup with its massive X7 - after keeping dealers and customers waiting for the vehicle for nearly a decade, according to BNN . Mercedes, on the other hand, faced challenges with supplier bottlenecks at its lone U.S. assembly plant in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. It was only able to sell 316,094 vehicles in 2019 - just 135 more than the year prior, according to Bloomberg .

This might be because the meteoric rise in attention and value of blockchain projects has made way for an equally meteoric fall in 2018, also in attention and value. This, in turn, might have lead to mistrust and disinterest of many formerly enthused—and probably formerly rich—tech journalists. This radio silence, save for a few sprinkled bits of negativity, makes one thing very surprising: bitcoin was one of the highest performing assets of 2019. Even including the recent downturn, the asset has about doubled in value this year. This is great news for everyone who joined at the beginning of this year. But what happens when you want to spend some of your gains? When converting bitcoin back to fiat (or USD), you have to pay taxes on your gains. So far, the IRS has been fairly lenient in the monitoring and prosecution of Crypto tax evasion. However, the wind is changing.","FCA,FCAU",en,Benzinga Feeds

El paró le costó a la empresa una pérdida de beneficio de cerca de 3.000 millones de dólares y consiguió algunas mejoras laborales para los trabajadores, aunque no cambiar el problema estructural para la plantilla estadounidense: evitar que buena parte de la producción se desplace a economías más baratas, como México. Quien navegó al sindicato hacia esa movilización brutal fue Gary Jones, un veterano sindical que ascendió a presidente de la organización este mismo año. Ahora, cada vez hay más evidencias de que, mientras apretaban a sus socios para mantener su poder negociador, Jones, su antecesor -Dennis Williams- y otros miembros de la cúpula participaban de prácticas corruptas y despilfarraban el dinero del sindicato en lujos: desde estancias en mansiones durante meses en Palm Springs, a cenas opulentas o rondas de golf.","FCA,FCAU",es,ABC

The two mid-sized auto firms, which are yet to decide on a name for their new company, announced plans six weeks ago for a tie-up that will reshape the global industry, as car manufacturers grapple with a global downturn in demand. Car makers also face steep costs to develop cleaner models as more stringent emission targets set in. The PSA-FCA merger - which is aiming for annual cost savings of 3.7 billion euros ($4 billion) by combining technologies and through shared purchasing agreements - is expected to close in the next 12 to 15 months, the auto firms said in a statement. Before the 50-50 share merger is completed, one of PSA’s shareholders, China’s Dongfeng Motor Group, will trim its 12.2% stake in the French car maker by selling 30.7 million shares to PSA. That stake was worth 679 million euros ($748.4 million) at the most recent closing price, and Dongfeng will have 4.5% of the merged group.","FCAU,FCA",en,The Sun Daily

And there's also the slowing global auto demand at a saturated market. Additionally, FCA showed it is somewhat resisting this downward trend on Thursday as despite a small loss, the Italian-American manufacturer at least managed to beat third-quarter earnings forecasts thanks to record profitability in its North American segment. Fiat Chrysler shares jumped nearly 9%, just a day before it released its third-quarter earnings, following its PSA announcement earlier in the morning. Overall, they increased 8 per cent higher following the quarter earnings results. Fiat Earnings Report The company reported higher than expected operating earnings with a record €1.96 billion as opposed to expected €1.89 billion. North America is surely the company's brightest point what triggered the boost with record profits of €2bn and record margins of 10.6 per cent due the growth of its pick-up truck line.","FCA,FCAU",en,Benzinga Feeds

We begin by revisiting the wildfire crisis in California, as co-host Shane Skelton copes with a power outage and warnings that his community may soon have to evacuate. Governor Gavin Newsom's administration inherited this challenge, but now that he's in power what's his plan for coping with it? Next we look at the Trump administration's attack on a foundational California climate policy: its cap-and-trade system. Did California overstep by partnering with the province of Quebec? We also look at the latest developments in the clash over California's clean vehicle standards. Finally, we check in on the new bipartisan climate caucus in the Senate and debate the Republican backlash over the Democrats' climate agenda in the House.","FCA,FCAU",en,Green Technology

Earlier this year, negotiations for a merger between Fiat and other leading French carmaker Renault failed after Fiat Chrysler cited ""political conditions in France"" as a reason not to proceed with the deal, despite the fact that the potential union had the blessing of the French government. Fiat Chrysler shares rose sharply after the news.","FCA,FCAU",en,Novinite.com

Die beiden Marken sind schon seit knapp sechs Jahren eine Einheit. Dennoch reicht es noch immer nicht, um dauerhaft bestehen zu können. Nun soll es eine weitere Fusion mit Peugeot Citroen (und Tochter Opel ) richten. Das kann gut gehen – oder auch nicht. Schon einmal platzte eine Ehe mit Chrysler , Daimler hat vor rund 12 Jahren viel Geld in den Sand gesetzt und konnte den Partner, der zum Klotz am Bein wurde, nur mit Müh und Not loswerden.

But, the company's third quarter results easily beat up estimates despite the $1 billion strike cost for the quarter. This national strike was the longest in almost 50 years. As a consequence, the company has lowered its guidance for the year as the strike's cost was significantly higher than expected. Third Quarter Results Revenue of $35.47 billion exceeded the forecasts of $33.82 billion resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $1.72 versus the expected $1.31. The strike has taken 52% per share of the company's earnings whereas the revaluation of its investment in Lyft Inc (NASDAQ: LYFT ) and warrants from PSA Group deducted an additional 15 cents per share.

Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard is axing advisers linked to the former chief executive, and recent Japanese jailhouse guest, Carlos Ghosn, helping Senard put a firmer personal stamp on the carmaker. But with a government shareholder still breathing down his neck, any hopes of reigniting merger talks could easily be dashed. Investors in the 16 billion euro French group are still rueing a collapsed deal with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. The proposed combo promised about 5 billion euros of annual cost savings, Fiat reckoned, but fell apart in early June after the Italian-American carmaker decided “political conditions in France do not currently exist for such a combination to proceed”. So, Senard is clearing house. Renault is parting ways with Ghosn’s long-time financial advisers Ardea Partners, according to people familiar with the matter. The boutique, founded by former Goldman Sachs bankers, proved controversial in Paris because it was advising Renault on the Fiat deal while one of its top executives sat on Fiat’s board.","FCA,FCAU",en,Reuters UK

You may find them synonymous with outrageous designs, exaggerated interiors, and features that have never been seen in a production car, like this floating key. They're typically revealed at auto shows where enthusiasts and the media ""ooh"" and ""ahh"" at the future of mobility.

2019-04-11 23:01:20-05:00,Fiat’s Small-Car Bet Falters With Americans Embracing Big Trucks,"(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- When the lease was up on Ed Kim’s 2015 Fiat 500L, he and his wife went through four Los Angeles area dealerships before they found one willing to take back the car. Three had dropped the Fiat brand from their stores—including the one that originally leased him the car. “We had this orphaned car in our driveway that we needed to bring back, with no dealership willing to take it in,” says Kim. “It was such a weird and bizarre situation.” Kim’s troubles are a sign of just how much Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’s American experiment with stylish Italian microcars has failed to live up to expectations. Fiat brand sales in the U.S. peaked at about 46,000 in 2014, with the addition of the roomier 500L, and have been in free fall ever since. They were down 45 percent year-over-year in the first quarter of 2019, after a 41 percent plunge last year to 15,521, the lowest level since the brand’s reintroduction to the U.S. in 2011. Fiat’s misadventures in the U.S. are perhaps a lesson in the futility of trying to get Americans to buy compact cars.","FCA,FCAU",en,Bloomberg

Unfortunately, the global misery doesn't appear to be anywhere near over yet, with arguably the world's most important market, China, set to post another slate of miserable sales numbers for February. New estimates from China's Passenger Car Association paint an outright terrifying picture for auto demand in the world's most populous nation as we head approach the end of the first quarter. Unofficial auto sales data for February includes China's passenger vehicle sales down 16.9% YOY to 1,207,538 units for wholesale, and down 19.0% YOY to 1,169,751 units for retail. Luxury brands saw a 2.9% retail sales decline and mainstream JV brands had a 13.8% decline. Domestic brands had a 27.5% decline. Meanwhile, the latest weekly sales estimates for OEMs released by Morgan Stanley show that Chang'an Ford will see a stunning drop of 76.1% in sales, followed by China's Brilliance Motor, who is set to see a 47.3% decline in sales.","FCA,FCAU",en,Zero Hedge

2019-03-07 11:11:55-05:00,Hertz Is One Recession Away From Bankruptcy,"Via BlindersOffResearch.com, Operating income hasn’t covered interest expense since 2015 and the total debt continues to soar. The competition has been pressuring revenue since 2013 and is only getting stronger. 2018 used-vehicle values were as good as it’s going to get. Airline passenger volume falls during recessions and 68% of Hertz’s revenue comes from airport locations. In a recent interview with Real Vision, I identified Hertz as a good short target. Since the interview, Hertz reported Q4 and full-year earnings (or lack thereof) that were above analyst estimates causing the stock to rally. Most of the improvement that took analysts by surprise was due to the abnormally strong performance in used-vehicle values during 2018 which dropped Hertz’s used-vehicle depreciation per unit by 16% on a year-over-year basis. So is all of the pessimism surrounding Hertz overdone and should the 2018 results be the all-clear signal to buy? Let’s let’s take a closer look. Used-Vehicle Values Used-vehicle values play a very important role in the profitability of rental car companies.","FCA,FCAU",en,Zero Hedge

2019-03-02 09:01:48-05:00,US Auto Sales Tumble To 18 Month Low As SUV Demand Hits A Brick Wall,"SUVs were, until this month, one of the sole remaining bright spots in the rapidly slowing U.S. auto market. Despite the fact that they were crippling traditional sedan sales, Americans' transition to SUVs was seen as a silver lining, prompting many automakers to make infrastructure changes to account for the change in demand. Those days, however, seem to be over, according to the latest, February U.S. auto sales data. Fiat Chrysler posted its first monthly sales decline in a year, according to Bloomberg . The kicker? Jeep, the company's driving force for the past several years, showed a rare back-to-back drop in deliveries. Charlie Chesbrough, senior economist of Cox Automotive said: “ The results today suggest a much bigger story: The sales pace has finally shifted into a lower gear.” The fact that Jeep sales have slowed is a warning indicator that the SUV ""boom"" in the U.S. could be coming to an end. Mired by higher interest rates and continued tightening of credit, buyers are forcing once record high SUV sales and prices back down again.","FCA,FCAU",en,Zero Hedge

2019-02-27 22:40:00-05:00,"Ford ""Quietly"" Laying Off Thousands From Its China Joint Venture","At a time when global auto sales are grinding to what feels like inevitable prolonged recession, the world is taking many of its industry cues from China. Which is why it is notable that Ford's China JV would be laying off ""thousands"" of workers according to the NYT. Thousands of the JV's 20,000 total workers are expected to be laid off as a result of weak auto sales in the world's second largest economy - a sign of continuing weakness for autos (and the overall economy) heading into the second quarter of 2019. Layoffs recently ""quietly begun"", according to additional reporting from Reuters. Neither Ford nor its China JV, formed in partnership with Changan Automobile Group, had a comment on the reported layoffs Wednesday morning. Car sales in China continued their relentless descent in January, falling 17.7%, as we recently expected would happen when discussing Europe's tumbling January auto sales. This follows the country's first full year slump (2018) in more than two decades and it puts further pressure on the state of the global automotive market.","FCA,FCAU",en,Zero Hedge

As evidence, Bloomberg cites the same data that we highlighted last week, namely that industrial production across the 19-nation euro area is ""falling at the fastest pace since the financial crisis, and deteriorating demand is evident as the region finds itself squeezed between international and domestic drags. "" According to Wednesday data, industrial output for the Euro area slumped 0.9% in December from November, double the forecast, while the annual decline was the steepest since 2009.","FCA,FCAU",en,Zero Hedge
