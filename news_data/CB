In a letter sent to the chief executives of the world's 30 largest insurance companies coordinated by the Insure Our Future campaign today, a raft of high profile green groups warned many insurers' nominal support for climate targets was undermined by their on-going contracts with the fossil fuel industry. ""As the world's professional risk managers, insurance companies have a strong understanding of pandemics as well as the climate emergency,"" they wrote. ""As governments plan the recovery from the Covid-19 crisis, insurers need to champion the transition to a sustainable, fair and resilient future as underwriters, investors and corporate citizens."" The Insure our Future campaign, which includes 350.org, Greenpeace International, ClientEarth, and the Rainforest Action Network, has called on companies to cease insuring new oil and gas expansion projects and commit to phasing out insurance to the fossil fuel industry in line with the Paris Agreement's 1.5C warming pathway.",CB,en,BusinessGreen

2020-05-05 15:48:00-05:00,5 Reasons Why Institutional Investors Refuse to Join the Crypto Sector,"Crypto investors have long believed that institutional investors would lead to the next Bitcoin moon event but this is a false narrative built on nothing more than hope. For the past two years, crypto-media outlets and Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocates have placed heavy emphasis on the need for institutional investors to embrace the cryptocurrency sector. The oft-stated belief was that institutional inflow would lead to mass adoption and an incredible spike in the value of crypto-assets as a whole. Fast forward to the present, and the total cryptocurrency market capitalization has yet to reach the $750 billion all-time high seen in late 2017. The slow recovery of crypto prices raises a few hard to answer questions. If institutional funds have been flowing into cryptocurrencies, why hasn’t there been a significant price increase over the last three years? Either there is an almost infinite sell pressure — which shouldn’t be a barrier considering the total crypto market cap is just $248 billion — or this theory that institutional investment will pump crypto prices does not hold.",CB,en,Cointelegraph

This is ATI’s 13th annual S&P rating, which has remained consistent despite occasional economic downturns and instability in the past decade and now in the current COVID-19 pandemic. ATI’s continued strength was attributed to several factors including its demonstrated preferred creditor status, which is seen as a key factor in the company’s ability to weather the expected negative impacts of COVID-19. Specifically, S&P noted “Even amid weakening economic fundamentals in the region following the outbreak of COVID-19, we expect that ATI’s members will uphold ATI’s preferred creditor status, recovering any payouts on noncommercial claims.” S&P also indicated that this rating outlook factors in the difficulties facing the countries ATI operates in during the Coronavirus pandemic, and assessed that ATI remains capable of weathering the effects of a difficult period ahead particularly during 2020.",CB,en,African Manager
