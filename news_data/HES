Some producers that were forced to pare back oil production are already reversing cuts as a result. Still, don't expect oil demand to fully recover before the end of next year, analysts say. It could take even longer before US production grows. For more stories like this, sign up here for our weekly energy newsletter, Power Line .

And when markets opened Tuesday morning, just days after OPEC Plus agreed to extend record supply cuts through July, WTI was trading at about $38 a barrel — up another 8% or so, since the start of June.
