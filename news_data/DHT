2020-08-14 10:33:53-05:00,"Supertanker Double-Whammy: Less Volume, Shorter Hauls","""The unwinding period is going to be painful. It's happening,"" warned Michael Fogerty, senior vice president of commercial operations of Diamond S Shipping (NYSE: DSSI ), during a quarterly call on Thursday. Fogerty was referring to the drawdown of crude stocks in Asia that have built up on land and at sea over the past several months. The Asian drawdown hits very large crude carriers (VLCCs, tankers that carry 2 million barrels of oil) on two fronts. Not only is less crude flowing to Asia, but less is flowing on long-haul runs from the Atlantic Basin, slashing average voyage distance. Atlantic Basin Focus ""In recent weeks, the Atlantic market has been more active than the Arabian Gulf market in terms of loading VLCCs,"" said Trygve Munthe, co-CEO of DHT Holdings (NYSE: DHT ), on his company's latest quarterly call. ""We're suffering from a very low level of fixtures out of the Arabian Gulf,"" he said. As a result, America and Brazil ""are becoming more important load areas for the VLCC trade."" Now, Asian destocking is putting a damper on Atlantic cargoes as well. ""You're seeing that long-haul crudes, whether from the U.S.",DHT,en,Benzinga

2020-04-13 13:55:14-05:00,Massive OPEC+ Cuts Not Enough To Derail Tanker Earnings,"Never before has oil production been slashed this much this quickly, but it still isn't enough to offset coronavirus demand destruction. OPEC and cooperating non-OPEC countries such as Russia (a coalition known as OPEC+) will cut output by 9.7 million barrels/day (b/d) in May-June, 7.7 million b/d in July-December and 5.8 million b/d in January-April 2021. Coronavirus demand destruction is estimated to exceed 20 million b/d. Continued excess production will pull more tankers into use as floating storage, reducing the number of vessels bidding for spot voyage deals and prolonging historically high rates. ""In any other time, an output cut of this magnitude would be the death knell for the tanker industry,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Jon Chappell. ""But with the reductions failing to match the estimated demand destruction, inventories are still likely to build materially … pressuring near-term oil prices and incenting floating storage. ""Tanker stocks are the only place for energy capital before the demand/supply imbalance inflects,"" maintained Chappell.",DHT,en,Benzinga Feeds
2020-04-06 12:25:00-05:00,"""Money Doesn't Grow On Trees... It Floats On The Ocean""","""Money Doesn't Grow On Trees… It Floats On The Ocean"" “ There’s oil all over the oceans right now. That’s where they are storing oil; we have never seen anything like that,” Trump, rather oddly bringing up such an archaic topic, said this week from the podium of the White House. “Every ship is now loaded to the gills.” And he was right. With oil demand in freefall, traders are resorting like never before to using the world’s fleet of supertankers as temporary floating storage facilities, filling them with millions of unsold barrels until better times. As Bloomberg's Javier Blas notes, it’s an unusual trade, but one that’s among the most lucrative around right now, just when everyone on Wall Street struggles to make money. What Trump didn’t say is that the most intriguing facet of the floating storage trade is just how profitable it is. In the industry, it’s often described as a money printing press: traders buy oil on the cheap, and immediately sell their cargo forward in the futures market, locking in a chunky profit - with very little risk.",DHT,en,Zero Hedge

2020-04-03 16:07:30-05:00,Roller-Coaster Ride Continues For Crude-Tanker Stocks,"It was all setting up so nicely for crude-tanker stocks until those Trump tweets on Thursday morning … Shares of companies that own very large crude carriers (VLCCs; tankers that carry 2 million barrels of crude) had been climbing steadily since early March, pulled upward by spot rates of over $200,000 per day and expectations for a spike in floating-storage contracts. Then, like a roller coaster that rumbles over the top of the slope and gathers speed on the other side, the stocks came back down. At 10:30 a.m. Thursday, the U.S. president tweeted that Saudi Arabia and Russia would cut production by 10 million barrels per day (b/d), then: ""Could be as high as 15 … GREAT news for everyone!"" Actually, not everyone. Reduced output equates to fewer VLCC cargoes and less future storage. Merely talking about production cuts can immediately incentivize tanker owners to accept lower rates. Between the tweets and Friday's closing bell, crude pricing rose 30% and VLCC stocks went in the opposite direction, despite the fact that VLCC spot rates still exceed $220,000 per day: DHT Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DHT ) fell 22%, Frontline Ltd. (NYSE: FRO ) 21%, Euronav (NYSE: EURN ) 16% and International Seaways, Inc. (NYSE: INSW ) 13%.",DHT,en,Benzinga Feeds
2020-02-14 09:06:31-05:00,Some Shipping Execs Fear Markets Underestimate Virus,"Ocean shipping is the ""canary in the coal mine"" for how coronavirus will impact the global economy. And according to shipping executives speaking at the Tradewinds Shipowners Forum New York event on Thursday, global markets need to focus more on this particular canary. It's in trouble. ""I think the markets and many people are still underestimating the knock-on effects that the coronavirus will have,"" warned Angela Chao, CEO of the Foremost Group, a dry bulk shipping owner that does considerable business with China. ""Even yesterday, the U.S. [stock markets] were still up,"" she said. Just one example of potentially excessive optimism: Shares of crude-tanker owner DHT Holdings (NYSE: DHT ) are up 10% since Friday, as investors bet on a V-shaped post-virus bounce. ""There's still not a full realization of the interruptions to the workforce, of people trying to get back to work in China, to our supply chains. All of that is going to have a tremendous effect,"" said Chao. ""People are still likening the coronavirus to SARS,"" she lamented, insisting that this is a mistake. ""The viruses are very different and more importantly, China's position in the global economy, both in terms of its connectedness as well as its impact, is completely different."" She noted that SARS was a ""1% blip"" for China's economy.",DHT,en,Benzinga

2019-11-27 09:19:00-05:00,Shipping's Spot-Rate Model Could Collide With Green Agenda,"The past two months have offered a textbook example of just how much stock investors crave the volatility of ocean shipping spot markets. Spot rates for very large crude carriers (VLCCs, tankers designed to carry 2 million barrels of crude oil) skyrocketed from $50,000 per day at the end of September to around $200,000 per day on Oct. 11, dropped back to $60,000 by mid-November and have now popped back above $100,000 per day. It's hard to find other markets to bet on that gyrate to this extreme. Tanker stocks with exposure to these spot rates have surged in response. This deep-seated focus on spot rates — not just among public and private investors but also among commodity charterers — could complicate plans to reduce the shipping industry's carbon footprint in the years ahead, a move that will almost certainly require much more time-charter coverage. Penalizing Period Charters Investors react negatively when ship owners do not have enough exposure to soaring spot rates. Case in point: the stock of Tsakos Energy Navigation or TEN (NYSE: TNP ), one of the largest tanker owners in the public market, which has lagged its compatriots, not just because it focuses on smaller vessel classes, but also because of its higher time-charter coverage.",DHT,en,Benzinga Feeds
2019-11-07 14:09:57-05:00,Shipping Earnings Roundup: Here Come The Dividends,"In the recent flood of earnings reports by U.S.-listed ocean shipping companies, common themes have risen to the surface: Third-quarter results are still in the red and weaker than expected, earnings are being impaired by out-of-service time due to exhaust-gas scrubber installations, rates are up sharply in the fourth quarter – and most importantly, as sentiment brightens, dividends are now back in vogue. Here Come The Dividends ""We think the reemergence of dividends will become a major theme in shipping equity markets over the next 12 months as companies institute and grow payouts in response to firming day rates and cleaned-up balance sheets across the group,"" asserted Amit Mehrotra, transportation analyst of Deutsche Bank, in a new client note. Dry bulk owner Genco Shipping & Trading (NYSE: GNK ) has just announced instituted a regular dividend of $0.175 per quarter – its first regular dividend since 2008 – plus a special dividend of $0.325 per share. During the quarterly conference call on Nov. 7, multiple analysts congratulated Genco CEO John Wobensmith on the arrival of his new dividend with the exuberance of friends congratulating a father for the birth of his newborn baby.",DHT,en,Benzinga Feeds
