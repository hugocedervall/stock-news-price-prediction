But the story is different for the cyclical consumer discretionary sector, they say, pointing out that the COVID-19-induced recession has taken on a different nature than other downturns. ""Contrary to what most might believe, Consumer Discretionary has among the largest share of Covid beneficiaries based on market cap,"" the bank's chief US Equity Strategist Mike Wilson said in a Nov. 30 note. ""We maintain an equal-weight in Consumer Discretionary as the sector has seen record outperformance in concentrated fashion. About 60% of the sector's market cap is tied to e-commerce and nesting — trends that are well understood by the market, richly valued, and likely to face tough [comparables] into next year,"" Wilson added. However, there are still opportunities in the sector, the bank says. Investors seeking to capitalize on consumer discretionary stocks during the recovery just need to be selective. ""We advocate stock selection in groups that have a clearer path to recovery and that remain well off the highs — Consumer Durables/Apparel and Consumer Services (Hotels/Restaurants),"" Wilson said.",STZ,en,Business Insider

2020-01-21 17:16:30-05:00,Canopy Growth (CGC) and Why its Infused Beverage Business Will Struggle,"Canopy Growth ( CGC ) has recently enjoyed the rebound in the cannabis market, as sentiment, at least temporarily, has grown more optimistic for the overall sector. In this article we'll look at why the company has a good chance of under performing in the infused beverage market, and what that could mean over the long term for Canopy Growth. We'll also look at the positive impact an increase in same-store sales could have on the company going forward. Product returns One of the major concerns I have for Canopy Growth is its inability to accurately identify demand trends, which in the last quarter came back to bite them, as it had product returns of just under $27 million, much of that coming from a lack of demand for its oil products. I don't think that's only from misreading demand, but from misreading the trend itself. It remains to be seen if oils will be the positive catalyst some following the industry, and some in the industry itself, have believed it would be. Canopy Growth was definitely wrong in its assumptions concerning demand for oils.","STZ,STZ.B",en,Nasdaq

The deal brings changes to the terms of Constellation's warrants in Canopy, in which it has invested $4 billion, according to Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog. As part of that deal announced last August, Constellation Brands gained 38% ownership and received warrants that if exercised would raise that stake to above 50%. Herzog wrote in a note to clients that there are four key impacts from the modification of the warrants, three of which are positive and one slightly negative. On the positive side, the deal extends the exercise period for Constellation to five to eight years from three years previously, ""suggesting less 'cash out the door',"" for the Corona beer distributor. Also positive, the deal does not change Constellation's representation on the Canopy board in the form of four directors.","STZ,STZ.B",en,MarketWatch
