The $2.9 billion merger of two of Canada’s biggest oil-sands players would reduce Li’s and CK Hutchison’s combined holdings in the new entity to 27%.By cutting their Husky stake, Li and his older son Victor -- the chairman of CK Hutchison -- are seeking to reduce the drag on the earnings at their group, which has been buffeted by the coronavirus pandemic. Shares of Calgary-based Husky have plunged more than 85% in the past 10 years, and the company has reported a total $3.3 billion of losses in the three quarters through June.“The proposed Husky merger will effectively reduce earnings volatility induced by the Canadian oil operation,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts led by Cusson Leung wrote in a note Monday. “This used to be the most cyclical element in CKH’s earnings.”Like many of its peers, Husky has been losing money following the crash in oil demand due to the pandemic.",CVE,en,Yahoo Finance
