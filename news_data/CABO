However, according to the website Kill The Cable Bill , people canceling their pay-TV subscriptions during the lockdown period accelerated. Kill The Cable Bill cited a report from Leichtman Research, revealing major cable companies lost 501,400 subscribers in the three months ending on June 30. Here's a breakdown of the exodus: Comcast: (478,000) Charter: +94,000 Cox: (50,000) Altice: (34,600) Mediacom: (17,000) Atlantic Broadband: (2,800) Cable One: (13,000) Kill The Cable Bill estimates the 501,400 subscriber decline equates to approximately $55 million loss for cable companies over the period. The most recent estimates put the average cable bill at $109.60 per month. So when you crunch the numbers, that means Big Cable lost about $54,953,440 from subscribers in the second quarter.",CABO,en,Zero Hedge
