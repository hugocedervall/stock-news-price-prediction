2020-10-20 17:45:00-05:00,Playing Chicken In The High Yield Market,"Playing Chicken In The High Yield Market Tyler Durden Tue, 10/20/2020 - 18:45 By Nick Dunbar of Risky Finance When Covid-19 sent corporate bonds into a tailspin in March , it set in motion a game of chicken at overleveraged companies. Like James Dean and his rivals in the movie Rebel Without A Cause , the companies and their bondholders were like drivers racing towards a cliff. Should investors accept a painful write down on their bonds in order to keep companies alive and avoid even worse pain later on? Or should they call the company’s bluff and insist on full repayment of their debt? The Risky Finance corporate bond tool provides a ringside seat on some of these scenarios. Take the sector whose spreads declined the most on average since March – Oil & Gas. Investors in high yield bonds who bought that month have seen returns of 300% or more, while investment grade bonds have provided a 30% return since then.
