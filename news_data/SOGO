Reuters reports that China's ""top cyber authority"" has declared that it will carry out a ""rectification"" of China's mobile internet browsers. The campaign is a response to concerns about ""chaos"" in terms of information being shared online. Doesn't sound too different from what's happening over at Twitter and Facebook. But we digress.

Some suspect that President Trump's attacks on China, combined with the pro-independence party that continues to rule Taiwan and the pro-democracy protests that preceded a wave of street violence in Hong Kong last year, may push President Xi to drastic action to assert China's dominance once and for all.",SOGO,en,Zero Hedge
