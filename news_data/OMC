Here's what we know.,"Summary List Placement Samsung cancelled a competitive review of its US digital ad and media-buying business due to economic uncertainty caused by the coronavirus, several people with direct knowledge of the matter said. A person close to the business said Samsung wanted to focus on its core business of selling smartphones and other personal electronics during the second half of 2020 instead of spending time and money to review its advertising. They suggested the review, which started over the summer, may resume when the pandemic's impact eases. Publicis Groupe, which has held the account since 2007, was facing off against fellow holding company giants WPP, IPG, and Dentsu in the pitch. The exception was Omnicom, which has a conflict with longtime client Apple. The development is the latest big change to the marketing industry wrought by the pandemic's economic effects. Samsung is one of the largest advertisers to cancel or postpone a review due to the pandemic.

After much hand-wringing — yes, legalizing cannabis is a much more complicated issue than it seems — the House vote on the MORE Act, a bill to federally decriminalize cannabis, has been delayed until the lame duck session after the election. Cannabis legalization is popular among voters. But it's politically tricky, as the back-and-forth this week reveals. In the meantime, cannabis investors, execs, and analysts aren't waiting. They say what happens in states like New Jersey is much more important. What else?

The pandemic has accelerated cord cutting as the number of streaming services grows while advertisers cut linear TV budgets and rework big commitments with networks like NBCUniversal, Disney, and ViacomCBS. And AT&T — one of the biggest sellers of targeted, or so-called addressable advertising — is reportedly mulling spinning off its pay-TV service DirecTV and digital ad firm Xandr that was supposed to help it along. Addressable advertising has always represented a small amount of TV inventory, but the coronavirus has exposed some of its pitfalls like high ad prices, a lack of measurement standards, and growing competition from streaming TV companies. When the coronavirus shut down production schedules and sports, advertisers pulled their addressable campaigns along with national ad spend, said Matt Kramer, managing director of advanced advertising at Omnicom Media Group.",OMC,en,Business Insider

Insider Intelligence analyzes this industry and several others to provide in-depth analyst reports, proprietary forecasts, customizable charts, and more. Learn more about what we offer. Podcasting is increasingly seen as a reliable channel for long-term ad investments, new data from the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) shows: Annual ad buys, where ads are bought for the entire year, nearly doubled in the US from 24% to 47% of podcast ad revenues between 2018 and 2019. Meanwhile, quarterly ad buys and scatter ad buys, where ads are purchased closer to the time they air, declined — making up 31% and 21%, respectively. According to the IAB, podcast ad revenues totaled $479.1 million in 2018 and $708.1 million in 2019. This is a sign that more advertisers are including podcast ads in their long-term marketing plans, rather than just using podcasts to experiment with. It's a testament to the rise of the podcasting industry: Listeners are increasing rapidly — eMarketer expects US podcast listeners to grow by nearly 15% to surpass 100 million this year — and podcasting platforms have responded by working to meet the technological needs that advertisers have come to expect from digital formats.",OMC,en,Business Insider
