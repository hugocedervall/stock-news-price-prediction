2020-09-02 11:47:03-05:00,$3 Billion Planned for Next-Generation Hydrogen Power Plants,"(Bloomberg) -- Three power plants planned in New York, Virginia and Ohio will test whether hydrogen can one day replace natural gas in electric generation.Power producers Danskammer Energy LLC, Balico LLC and EmberClear are paying Mitsubishi Power Americas Inc. more than $3 billion for the facilities, which will collectively generate 3,284 megawatts of electricity. While the plants will initially run on natural gas alone, they’ll eventually shift to burning green hydrogen produced and stored on-site. They’re designed to make it easier to ramp up hydrogen use as production increases, said Chief Executive Officer Paul Browning.Green hydrogen -- produced by stripping the gas from water using electrolyzers powered by wind and solar -- is seen as key to eliminating carbon emissions from the industrial sector that now relies on natural gas as both a fuel source and a feedstock.Other electric generators are also exploring integrating green hydrogen into their power production in an effort to slash emissions as more states set renewable-energy mandates.",NEE,en,Yahoo Finance

Prolonging the lifespan of multi-billion dollar gas infrastructure investments makes for another compelling incentive. But big utilities in Europe and North America, increasingly large actors on the global energy stage, are not staying on the sidelines.

The CEO of a $3 billion asset manager reveals a decade-long trend that's boosting utilities — and shares his 3 top picks.,"The utilities sector has long been considered a haven for investors in uncertain times. In the next 5 to 10 years, utilities will benefit from cheap solar panels and wind turbines, according to Jay Rhame, who runs a $3 billion asset management firm. Rhame values growth over outright yield and favors companies with management teams that are skilled at cost control. He shares three of his top picks including NextEra Energy, CMS Energy, and Eversource. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . When cash is tight, you might not buy a new summer wardrobe or purchase a sports car, but chances are you'll still pay your bill for electricity, gas, and water. That's one reason why utility companies are seen as havens for investors in times of market uncertainty. Plus, many utilities are protected by government regulations and pay investors hefty dividends. But for Jay Rhame, who helms a $3 billion long-only asset management firm, utilities are not just about safety. They're also about growth. ""We're really excited about the utility sector,"" said Rhame, the chief executive of Reaves Asset Management, a firm focused on investing in essential services that's headquartered in Jersey City, New Jersey.

Last year wind overtook hydropower in total generation, and 2020 is on track to be a record year for new wind farm construction. But all other energy sources are losing ground to solar these days, wind included. Solar accounted for 40 percent of new U.S. generation capacity in 2019, its largest share in history. After 2020 its lead over wind will widen rapidly, according to Wood Mackenzie's forecast. Large-scale solar is already cost competitive with wind in many states, and analysts believe solar has an easier path toward further cost reductions . In Texas, home to nearly a third of the country’s 100 gigawatts of wind capacity, there’s now more solar than wind in the interconnection queue. Falling costs, steady efficiency gains and federal incentives have thrust solar to the center of the strategic plans of many American energy companies.

As many as three-quarters of American households are unable to access rooftop solar — because they rent, or live in an apartment building, or a rooftop system is not affordable for them. Enter community solar: a simple, even elegant concept. Neighbors who are unable to build their own solar systems can join together, build a larger and more cost efficient installation nearby, and use the energy it provides to power their homes. Like many simple concepts, however, the details can quickly become overwhelming. In the first of a new series of explanatory articles, GTM will help you understand what community solar is and how it works. Is there a basic definition of community solar? There's no national standard for what a community solar program looks like, and there are plenty of disagreements about what makes a program most effective.

That figure emerged in the “reference system portfolio” that the California Public Utilities Commission approved March 26. The grid planning document calls for no new gas plants, although almost all of the existing capacity is expected to stay online through the decade. But it adds 11 gigawatts of utility-scale solar by 2030, nearly 3 gigawatts of wind, and a groundbreaking amount of energy storage. The plan anticipates 8,873 megawatts of batteries, the technology that dominates the energy storage market today. That’s many times over the national cumulative installed battery capacity today. But the CPUC broke new ground in carving out space for nearly 1 gigawatt of “pumped storage, or other long-duration storage with similar attributes” by 2026. “This is the first formal mechanism we’ve seen that recognizes that need in the system,” said Mateo Jaramillo, co-founder of seasonal storage technology startup Form Energy. “The state recognizes that it needs to send the right signal to the market now in order to meet the longer-term goals.” Technologists working on long-duration storage, which proposes to complement wind and solar plants by storing power for many more hours than lithium-ion batteries can handle cost-effectively, have raised hundreds of millions of venture dollars and grant funding and produced an eclectic mix of plausible technologies .",NEE,en,Green Technology

The top tier of solar asset owners worldwide could change dramatically over the next 12 months due to the rapid ascent of a number of oil and gas companies, said Tom Heggarty, principal analyst in the energy transition practice at Wood Mackenzie. France's Total, which controls SunPower and already had around 3 gigawatts of renewable generation assets before buying into a 2.1-gigawatt PV portfolio this month, will almost certainly be one of solar energy’s biggest asset holders. BP, Galp and Shell could also rank among the dozen or so leading solar generators, Heggarty said. The oil and gas sector’s assault on the solar market is made easier by the fact that PV asset ownership is highly fragmented. The top 10 asset holders globally control around 10 percent of the 600 gigawatts or so of capacity installed worldwide. Outside China, there are only a couple of dozen companies in the world with more than a gigawatt of solar capacity under ownership.",NEE,en,Green Technology

The energy storage industry begins the new decade in the midst of a rapid transformation from a niche market to one at the center of the global energy transition. Most grid-scale projects built over the past decade were limited to shorter-duration applications, such as ancillary services for the grid, the “lowest-hanging fruit of the storage tree,” a new WoodMac research note says. But the market has seen a rash of major project announcements recently, driven in particular by the U.S., where developers are increasingly pairing large-scale solar arrays with batteries. NextEra Energy, North America’s leading renewables developer, is adding substantial storage capacity both through its regulated Florida utility and its independent generation arm .

2020-02-19 06:55:00-05:00,No ‘Honeymoon Period’ for Energy Storage Investments as Big Money Pours In,"NEW YORK — Big power plant developers are increasingly convinced they should be investing in battery projects in the United States. The challenge is finding investments that will pay off. After years of promise, energy storage is finally on the cusp of blossoming into a multi-gigawatt annual market in the U.S. But the industry’s rapid takeoff means there may not be a “honeymoon period” for investors, like there was in the earlier days of wind and solar, developers say. From PacifiCorp to NV Energy , a growing number of major American utilities are drawing up aggressive plans to add storage capacity. Even in deregulated power markets like Texas, the falling cost of batteries is rapidly opening new opportunities for storage. Power plant developers like NextEra Energy Resources and Southern Power are moving quickly to take advantage of this new market, whose value is expected to surge tenfold from 2018 to 2023, to $5 billion annually, according to Wood Mackenzie. Southern Power, the independent generation arm of utility Southern Company, has “shied away” from large-scale solar projects in recent years due to questionable returns, said Phillip Adams, development services manager.",NEE,en,Green Technology

Berkshire Hathaway Energy topped perennial leader NextEra Energy in completing more new capacity than any other operator, thanks to the aggressive wind build-out underway at its Iowa utility, MidAmerican Energy. NextEra came in second place for new capacity, followed by Avangrid Renewables, Xcel Energy and Enel Green Power, according to AWEA’s figures.

The company is reviewing “a number of opportunities to add storage to our existing solar sites to take advantage of the [investment tax credit] and enhance the value of our existing projects for customers.” NextEra has already set a precedent for this approach: In 2018 it added a 10-megawatt battery facility to its existing Babcock Ranch solar farm in Florida. Last March things got much more interesting when its Florida Power & Light unit announced plans to build a 409 megawatt/900 megawatt-hour battery project known as the Manatee Energy Storage Center, to be charged by an existing solar facility.

Yet many are still struggling to understand how to value energy storage as an investment. As a growing number of cities, states and businesses commit to 100 percent clean energy, storage is already playing a pivotal role in determining how they will meet these targets. Wood Mackenzie's latest Global Energy Storage Outlook projects that deployments will grow 13-fold over the next six years, from a 12 gigawatt-hour market in 2018 to a 158 gigawatt-hour market in 2024. This emerging market represents a huge opportunity. Global investments of $374 billion a year will be needed to upgrade the grid with enough flexibility to account for the variable power generation profiles of renewable technologies like solar and wind. Storage solutions are now a growing part of this energy transition, and will represent a $150 billion industry in the U.S. alone by 2023 . However, massive deployment numbers and dropping costs won’t streamline project finance for energy storage in the short term.",NEE,en,Green Technology

2019-12-18 14:41:02-05:00,The US Wind PTC Cliff Keeps Looking Less and Less Scary,"For the past five years, the U.S. wind industry has been bracing for the phase-down and expiration of its production tax credit — haunted, always, by concerns about what comes next. But the PTC “cliff” looks a lot less scary than it did just a few years ago, and that was true even before the one-year extension granted this week by Congress. The bad news is that many wind projects are unlikely to reach completion by the end of 2020, the deadline for developers hoping to secure the 100 percent PTC, which is worth roughly $24 per megawatt-hour generated for 10 years. Wood Mackenzie’s latest research counts 9 gigawatts of “at risk” projects aiming for completion in 2020, potentially worth nearly $11 billion of investment. The good news is that many if not most of those projects will get built the following year at the 80 percent PTC, crimping developers’ margins but still bringing gigawatts of clean power capacity onto the grid. That spillover effect has set up a remarkable situation: It looks likely that more new wind farms will get built in 2021 at the reduced PTC than in 2019 at the full value.",NEE,en,Green Technology

Solar accessibility advocates and retail giant Walmart now stand behind the 1.5-gigawatt program, after initially expressing concerns about access for low-income customers, costs and the distribution of the program’s financial benefits. The program, called SolarTogether, still needs final approval from state regulators, but Florida Power & Light told Greentech Media it hopes to launch the program in the first quarter of 2020. Among community solar programs as they’ve been defined, FP&L’s design is a bit novel. Under the current structure, 75 percent of the program’s capacity will go to commercial and industrial or governmental customers, with the remaining 372.5 megawatts left for residential and small businesses. FP&L also designed an escalating bill credit, meaning it will take several years for the subscription benefits to outweigh the cost of subscribing to the program.",NEE,en,Green Technology

Facing what some analysts estimate could be some $27 billion in fines relating to the role of malfunctioning equipment in causing wildfires, the bankruptcy process is expected to be a protracted mess as state and federal regulators try to figure out the best plan for holding the country's largest utility accountable. When it's all said and done, the outcome is expected to have wide-ranging implications for utility customers, fire victims, shareholders and wholesale power providers.
