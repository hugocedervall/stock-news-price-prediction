The deal includes manufacturing plants, distribution network and the Eveready brand.The all-cash deal is in the final stages of negotiation and is expected to be announced soon.

2019-05-01 06:00:00-05:00,You've been charging your smartphone all wrong,"All smartphone batteries have a limited lifespan, but the common habit of charging phones overnight could actually be shortening your battery's lifespan, according to a battery technology expert. Smartphone companies like Apple, Samsung , and LG aren't too bothered about whether you charge your phone overnight, and Google says most phones have systems in place to protect your phone's battery from overcharging. But at the end of the day, smartphone batteries still don't like being at 100% for too long. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you might be reducing your phone battery's long-term lifespan with certain charging behaviors. Specifically, if you often charge your phone overnight or keep it plugged in for hours after it's reached 100%, you're accelerating the aging process in lithium-ion smartphone batteries. "" If you're going to charge your phone to 100% and keep it at 100% — just keep on charging and charging overnight — this will have negative influence on aging,"" said Dominik Schulte, managing director of Germany-based battery technology consultancy firm BatterieIngenieure, who spoke with Business Insider.",ENR,en,Business Insider
