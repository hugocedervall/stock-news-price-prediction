According to the survey carried out by 380 PayPal users, there is an uptake in BTC purchases on the global payments platform as users take advantage of PayPal’s Bitcoin capabilities. According to the survey, 17% of the respondents said they had already purchased Bitcoin on PayPal, with a further 65% confirming they will use the top crypto in daily purchases of goods and services. After years of belittling Bitcoin adoption and banning its customers from participating in Bitcoin trading, PayPal finally embraced cryptocurrencies. In October this year, BEG reported PayPal would allow customers to buy and sell BTC alongside other top cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Litecoin (LTC). Since Bitcoin's price has exploded to set new all-time highs as retail customers on the payments platform stack up on the top crypto, Michael Santoli, a CBNC markets commentator, explained BTC’s ripping price growth as a factor of PayPal accumulating more BTC for their customers to purchase. “Bitcoin ripping in part because PayPal and Square are buying loads of it to facilitate customer trading,” he wrote on Twitter.",BCH,en,BitcoinExchangeGuide

Researcher Ergo has been updating the community about the sale of these tokens over the years, which peaked in mid-2019. Only about 15k of the BTC are left of the original 201k BTC now.

This is significant because the all-time high for the cryptocurrency is $19,783 back in December of 2017, only to drop down to as low as $3,122. Within the past year, the price of Bitcoin has more than doubled, posting close to $10,000 in growth in the last two months alone. As Ethan Yang writes at The American Institute for Economic Research , with most of the news attention on Covid-19, the presidential election, and so on, it is understandable that the meteoric rise of Bitcoin may have slipped past casual observers as it did not receive the attention it received in 2017.

Cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift recently delisted three privacy coins: Dash , Zcash ( ZEC ) and Monero ( XMR ). This was an unexpected move to say the least, given the exchange’s historic commitment to privacy. As a noncustodial platform, Shapeshift did not impose user identification requirements on traders in its early days, although this began to change with the gradual introduction of a mandatory membership model, compliant with Know Your Customer rules, as of 2018. Why then, did it move to delist Dash, Zcash and Monero, even as other exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken and Binance.US still list these coins? In a statement shared with Cointelegraph, the chief financial officer of Dash Core Group, Glenn Austin, said he found the delisting “particularly frustrating because [it] could have been entirely avoided by a simple 10–15 minute call.” Austin believes the delisting boils down to “an educational issue.” While the reasons for the delisting have not been officially clarified, Austin has speculated that the move may be influenced by the currency having been mentioned twice in the Department of Justice’s recently published “Cryptocurrency Enforcement Framework.” In both cases, Dash was cited alongside Monero and Zcash as an example of an anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrency.",BCH,en,Cointelegraph

2020-07-28 21:12:00-05:00,Messari: DeFi Can Continue to Grow as ‘Useless’ Top 30 Coins Wither,"With the value of funds locked in DeFi almost quadrupling in less than two months, the community is debating whether DeFi is in a bubble. Data published by crypto market analytics firm Messari on July 29 indicates that the collective capitalization of the decentralized finance ( DeFi ) sector is equal to only 1.5% of the entire crypto capitalization. According to Messari, the collective capitalization of every DeFi project put together is roughly $4.12 billion — less than that of the fifth-ranked crypto asset by market cap, Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ). Watkins also noted that “literal meme coin” Dogecoin ( DOGE ) boasts a larger capitalization than every DeFi project with the exception of MakerDAO ( MKR ). Despite the recent DeFi boom leading to claims the sector is overvalued, analyst Ryan Watkins believes the small size of the DeFi sector means it still has significant room to expand, arguing that it could benefit from a “reallocation” of capital from top 30 projects that are “useless first-gen cryptocurrencies, ghost town ‘ETH killers’, and dead projects.” “DeFi doesn’t need new money flowing into crypto to continue its rise.",BCH,en,Cointelegraph

En cuanto al precio, Litecoin (LTC) ha tenido un año bastante duro y actualmente la altcoin ha bajado un 51% en los últimos doce meses. La falta de actividad en GitHub y las actualizaciones de protocolo planificadas han hecho que el cofundador de Litecoin, Charlie Lee, admitiera que 2019 experimentó un mínimo histórico en el número de desarrolladores que trabajan en Litecoin Core, el software detrás de los nodos de red.El comienzo de 2020 no fue diferente y Charlie Lee solicitó donaciones voluntarias de mineros LTC para ayudar a impulsar la financiación del desarrollo. Las incertidumbres con respecto al futuro de Litecoin han causado que los inversores pierdan interés en el proyecto y esto se refleja tanto en la cadena como en las métricas comerciales de LTC.Lo interesante es que, aunque la mayoría consideraría el desinterés de los inversores como un factor negativo, algunos han estado acumulando silenciosamente LTC.El fundador de Litecoin, Charlie Lee, habla sobre los rumores de abandono del proyectoEl volumen de comercio de Litecoin cae a un mínimo de 2 añosEl volumen es el indicador más relevante del interés de los traders y Litecoin ha fallado miserablemente en esta área.",BCH,es,Blockboard News

The Ethereum team has been trying to solve the blockchain scalability problem since 2014. During that time, solutions such as Raiden, Plasma, zk-SNARKs, sharding and rollups appeared in the developers’ tool kit. However, the implementation of some of them was constantly delayed, while others proved to be of limited efficacy. This was the issue until Ethereum’s Istanbul hard fork was implemented in December 2019, which gave hope that the network can finally become suitable for corporate use. Cointelegraph attempted to figure out whether the situation with the second-largest cryptocurrency’s scalability has changed and why not all the solutions have cut the mustard.

With the Bitcoin ( BTC ) halving only weeks away, anticipation appears to be building up as Google Trends data for the event show online searches reaching an all-time high. Bitcoin’s block reward halving comes following that of Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) and Bitcoin SV ( BSV ), where miners moved their hashing power to the BTC Chain. Several crypto pundits point to the halving potentially having a significant impact on the BTC spot price. Indeed, Bitcoin’s two previous halvings — November 2012 and July 2016 — have each been precursors to a new, all-time price high for BTC. However, the situation in the crypto and mainstream market in 2020 differs greatly from the two other halvings.

The Bitcoin ( BTC ) network hash rate took a steep dive on March 26, dropping by a whopping 15.95%, which is a 45% sink from its peak highs of 2020. The hash rate dipped from 136.2 quintillion hashes per second on March 1 to just 75.7 EH/s on March 26, according to data from Blockchain.com. Analytics website Coin Dance reported similar findings, with the 2020 peak standing at about 150 EH/s on March 5 and then dropping to 105.6 EH/s 10 days later, thus showing a 29% decrease. The combined effects of the hash rate decrease and the ensuing outflow of miners from the market have resulted in arguably one of the biggest blows to the Bitcoin network since 2011. The negative impact is difficult to fully assess at this time. However, the reasons for the slump are disputable and are being attributed to a number of factors — from the upcoming BTC halving and the raging coronavirus pandemic to a worldwide recession causing miners to leave the market.",BCH,en,Cointelegraph

Many were hoping that Bitcoin would finally show off its bonafides as a “safe haven” or flight to quality asset — something I myself have wondered about in the past. But crypto mostly tanked alongside everything else. There are two ways market watchers are interpreting this. Some observers now (disappointedly) think that crypto is just another risk-on asset, to be sold during a crisis. Others still think it’s a safe haven, and point to the fact that gold fell this past week as well (there is some precedence of precious metals falling during the peak of a crisis, then rebounding strongly. Make of that what you will). My hunch is that it’s neither. Crypto is mostly doing its own thing. Too few big players own any of it, or even consider owning it, for it to be caught up in the usual “risk-on, risk-off” calculations.",BCH,en,Zero Hedge
