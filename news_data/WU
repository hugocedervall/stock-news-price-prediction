To fill out a money order, you'll need to write out your information as well the information of the payee before signing your name.

They have been lauded as innovative and convenient in addition to being derided as sowing inequality. Fears over the exclusionary nature of cashless stores prompted a spate of legislative bans against them. Alex Bau, the Federal Reserve's director of data and policy analysis of the cash product office, said that nowadays, retailers seem to be more keen to ""meet the customer where they're at"" when it comes to payment options. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . It's fair to say that, on the surface, cashless retail stores have undergone a bit of a rise and fall. Cashless stores may have once seemed a futuristic innovation, but over the past few years they've ended up ushering in a backlash against inequality rather than a retail revolution. But that doesn't mean that cashless technology was a flash in the pan. Retailers are still interested in cashless options in terms of cutting costs and meeting consumer needs, even if a fully cashless environment remains elusive and unrealistic.",WU,en,Business Insider

2019-03-04 10:00:22-05:00,"JPM Analyzed 25,000 Corporate Transcripts: Here Is What It Found","While Q1 is now almost certain to show the first year over year earnings decline since 2016, the party was still raging in the fourth quarter, if far more subdued than for most of 2018, and as JPMorgan writes in its latest equity strategy note, investor response to 4Q earnings was better than feared (although largely on the back of the Fed's dovish reversal and the now daily report of US-China trade ""optimsim""). As a result, stocks delivered strong gains despite soft earnings delivery and lukewarm guidance — a contrast to prior quarters when companies delivered strong beats but investors were unfazed, mostly thanks to low equity leverage/positioning at start of the reporting season. Specifically, as JPM's Dubravko Lakos-Bujas writes, S&P 500 companies delivered record average 1-day excess return drift of 0.7% post-announcement (Figure 1) and outperformed both DM and EM peers (+7.5% since Jan 10 th, vs. MSCI Europe +5.9%, MSCI Japan +3.9%, and MSCI EM 6.3%). Furthermore, equity performance was positive despite negative revisions to 2019 EPS (growth declined to 4% vs. 8% 3-months ago) on lower margin outlook.",WU,en,Zero Hedge
