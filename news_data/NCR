While Walmart relies on vendors for some of the tech , it's also building much of it in-house through an army of thousands of data scientists and software engineers . The system for its recently-launched express delivery offering — which relies on AI to make real-time calculations based on factors like weather conditions and labor costs to figure out the fastest way to get products to a customer's door — was all built internally.
