2019-07-16 12:55:53-05:00,"Food-delivery services can't seem to pull people away from the 23 pounds of pizza they eat every year (UBER, GRUB, DPZ)","While franchises like Domino's are worried about food-delivery companies hurting their business, data from Cowen suggests services like UberEats and Grubhub have failed to lure consumers from ordering pizza the old-fashioned way. According to Cowen analyst Andrew Charles, pizza delivery won't experience a sharp drop-off as food-delivery companies expand. And any decline that does occur will be more gradual in nature. Cowen conducted a survey of 2,500 consumers and found those ordering the same amount of delivery between this year and last year indicated no change in pizza consumption. Visit the Markets Insider home page for more stories . The origins of food delivery can be traced back to calling a local pizza place. Now, people can get virtually any food they want with the tap of a few buttons on a smartphone. But it appears that despite the rapid expansion of apps like UberEats , Grubhub , and DoorDash, consumers aren't forgoing pizza as much as one would think, according to a report from Cowen.",DPZ,en,Business Insider
