Very much akin to 'maximum pressure' on Iran, where the administration has also slapped any and all sanctions possible in order to try and make a Biden presidency's attempt to restore US participation in the 2015 nuclear deal (JCPOA) near impossible, Trump wants to hem in the coming Biden administration and the ability for a Sino-US relations detente on a range of things like the Taiwan issue to China's intervention in Hong Kong to human rights to Chinese tech as a backdoor for spying. Swan writes , ""He'll try to make it politically untenable for the Biden administration to change course as China acts aggressively from India to Hong Kong to Taiwan, and the pandemic triggers a second global wave of shutdowns."" Source: Bloomberg/Getty Images While according to Axios' sources it won't necessarily entail dramatic moves like further closures of Chinese consulates in the US, it will likely take the form of a continued pressure campaign detailing in public ""China's nefarious actions"" in the US : ""Watch for National Intelligence Director John Ratcliffe to publicly describe in granular detail intelligence about China's nefarious actions inside the U.S.,"" writes Swan.",RJF,en,Zero Hedge

At least in the near term. That's because Democrats want to deliver a massive second coronavirus stimulus package worth at least $2 trillion, compared to a lighter version preferred by congressional Republicans. And a larger package will support consumer spending — the driving force behind the US economy — and in turn, corporate earnings. And chances of a Democratic sweep are growing. Wealth management firm Raymond James recently upped their chance of Democrats controlling the presidency and both chambers of Congress to 55%, from 50%. They also give Joe Biden a 65% chance of winning.

But the election will have important ramifications for your financial well-being, and we’re all over that agenda. How will each of the candidates help steer the economy? What might your tax bill be? Is your portfolio headed for gains or losses? For those questions, the person living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue for the next four years matters. SEE MORE 9 Ways COVID-19 Will Change the 2020 Elections At the start of the year, a sound economy, rock-bottom unemployment rates and a roaring bull market made it Donald Trump’s election to lose. Then came the coronavirus pandemic, exacting a vast and tragic human toll, putting a dramatic end to the longest economic expansion and bull market on record, and robbing tens of millions of Americans of their livelihood. It remains to be seen whether voters will renew President Trump’s lease on the White House in November, but former Vice President Joe Biden became a more formidable contender over the summer, if you believe the polls and the betting markets.",RJF,en,Kiplinger Washington Editors

2020-05-20 14:59:21-05:00,Things To Consider When Planning For Retirement,"Before the COVID-19 coronavirus became a global pandemic, markets were in an unrelenting uptrend. However, soon after world governments began introducing stay-at-home orders, forcing the closure of non-essential businesses and unemployment of millions, financial markets experienced a historic liquidation. As part of a reflection on the events that transpired, David Boike , founder at Retirement Resources , spoke with Benzinga regarding recent volatility and the importance of building diversified retirement portfolios. About Retirement Resources After working at a large financial services company, Boike determined there was a better way to help clients reach their financial goals. He founded Boike Financial Services in 1982 and later rebranded the firm to Retirement Resources. “We’re retirement planners helping [people] transition their 401Ks, IRAs, and investments into sustainable income throughout retirement.” In a nutshell, Retirement Resources is a licensed fiduciary that helps clients best achieve their financial goals. “Most people in this industry go to a Merrill Lynch , a Raymond James , a Fidelity , and they’re dealing with representatives of that company,” Boike said. “They get biased opinions because it’s whatever the company has on their shelf.” “After we find out their goals and objectives, we go out to the Fidelitys and the various other companies in the world and find the appropriate solutions.” Safe, Low-Risk Investments A Priority Retirement Resources prepares clients for a sustainable retirement by building portfolios that generate enough income to supplement Social Security and pension benefits. “It’s about preservation.",RJF,en,Benzinga

They might want to be ready for a change.While no move is expected as officials gather this week, economists and investors generally agree the Fed is going to cut rates this year.Bets on the Fed’s next moves got even more complicated Tuesday amid geopolitical turns. Investors first increased bets on a Fed cut after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said additional stimulus would be needed unless the outlook improved. That prompted President Donald Trump to tweet that Draghi was “unfairly” weakening the euro.Investors then dialed back rate-cut speculation somewhat after Trump later tweeted encouraging words about U.S.-China trade talks.The last two times the Fed began an easing cycle, in 2001 and 2007, it opted for a half-percent move over a quarter point adjustment.If and when the Federal Open Market Committee decides to ease again this year, its members will seriously contemplate doing the same.",RJF,en,The Economic Times India
