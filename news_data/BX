2020-12-07 12:24:18-05:00,Core Goldman Sachs Won't Flee New York for Florida,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. traces its roots back more than 150 years to 1869, when Marcus Goldman, a German immigrant, moved to New York City and opened a one-room office in a basement next to a coal chute at 30 Pine Street. Today, that address represents the heart of Manhattan’s financial district: One block north of Wall Street and one block south of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Goldman Sachs Asset Management, by contrast, was formed in 1988.This difference is important context to keep in mind after reading the scoop from Bloomberg News’s Sridhar Natarajan that Goldman is considering a new Florida hub to house its asset-management division. The news naturally set off alarms about the end of New York City as the undisputed financial capital of the U.S., given the surprise decision by AllianceBernstein Holding LP in 2018 to move its headquarters to Nashville and, more recently, the increased presence of Blackstone Group Inc. and Citadel in the Sunshine State.Make no mistake: Goldman is a powerhouse in asset management, managing $1.46 trillion as of the end of the third quarter, up 19% from a year earlier and more than Morgan Stanley’s investment management division stands to oversee even after the bank acquires Eaton Vance Corp.","AB,BX",en,Yahoo Finance

This time around, it’s gotten so popular that the bidding for slices of distressed companies can resemble a heated takeover battle, with as many as 20 private equity firms clamoring for a piece of one deal.The fever underscores the huge amount of money buyout shops are sitting on -- some $1.5 trillion, compared to $615 billion a decade ago -- and the dwindling number of traditional buyouts available. The firms are betting that struggling companies such as Cheesecake Factory Inc. and Expedia Group Inc. will recover once the economy opens up.Yet the competition for the deals has forced some firms to lower their typically high sights.","CAKE,BX",en,Economic Times India

What's more, over the past year, our list has slathered on the gravy, too, returning 13.6%, on average, counting dividends and price appreciation, compared with a 4.3% return for the S&P 500. Big gains don't come without some strings attached. Like many stocks that have ridden this record-long bull market, some of the names on our list appear to be richly valued now. And although dividends buttress returns when a stock's price slides, pricey stocks could take a big hit in the event of a stock market plunge. Perhaps more salient for dividend investors, major boosts in the share price diminish a stock's yield, as is the case with Blackstone Group and Realty Income--two stocks originally chosen for our list because, among other things, they historically provided yields above 4%.",BX,en,Kiplinger Washington Editors
