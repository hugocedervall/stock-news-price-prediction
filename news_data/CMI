2020-12-07 07:17:41-05:00,An unlikely beneficiary of 5G rollout,"The steady and slow roll-out of 5G networks across Asia-Pacific may not just be an opportunity for mobile service companies to boost profits. The roll-outs could also benefit an unlikely player in Cummins India Ltd (CIL), the maker of diesel gensets.Cummins management and analysts believe that the 5G networks require generators to sustain base stations and towers which CIL can produce and export in large numbers. The fact that China and Japan do not produce the kind of generators needed to power these towers means CIL has the potential to win large orders, they say.The GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) Association estimates that a 10 KW generator is needed in every base station. The 5G opportunity in Asia Pacific can help CIL report a new peak in exports over FY2022-23, according to analysts.“We estimate the additional 5G opportunity at Rs 200 crore per annum for Cummins India on an annual basis and growing over the next five years,” said Aditya Mongia, analyst, Kotak Securities. “We note that other entities of Cummins in Japan and China do not produce the product at present and hence Cummins India has started benefitting from rollout of 5G network in select countries – China, Malaysia and Philippines.”A sharp recovery in its export business in the September 2020 quarter and a visible pick in power division with robust operating performance has led the stock to jump 20% in the last one month.",CMI,en,Economic Times India

Maytag, Woodland and Sunset Parks suffered significant tree damage and as a result are too dangerous for the public to use. The city’s large equipment has been dedicated to street cleanup so city staff haven’t been able to utilize them for the parks. “The bigger tree cleanup was hindered by not having the bigger equipment available. Now we should be able to make some headway now that the streets are done,” parks operations superintendent Nick Cummins said. Even with the heavy machinery available for use, there is still a question of safety for city staff as they clear the large tree debris and hangers. The city has decided to hire contractors to help with some of the more dangerous cleanup efforts.

2019-11-04 10:00:10-05:00,Diesel's Market Dominance Earns Respect But Little Love,"With diesel fuel powering 97% of all heavy-duty trucks, it seems silly to predict its industry dominance will end. But don't tell that to California. The climate-conscious state mostly ignores the fuel's significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions, preferring to press for zero emissions from all commercial vehicles by the mid-2030s. An electric future in which batteries and hydrogen replace diesel is a captivating idea. German truck maker Daimler AG, including its market-leading North American unit, said Oct. 25 it is targeting 2039 to sell only battery- and hydrogen-powered fuel cell electric trucks in its key markets. At last week's biannual North American Commercial Vehicle Show in Atlanta, three Class 8 hydrogen fuel-cell prototype trucks from Hyundai Motor, Nikola Motors and engine-maker Cummins Inc. drew consistent crowds of curious onlookers on the exhibit floor. Tomorrowland Battery electric concepts covered chunks of real estate in numerous displays. Navistar International Corp .
