2020-06-12 19:38:02-05:00,Double lung transplant was the only way to save a young coronavirus survivor,"Even if the coronavirus treatment is ultimately effective at neutralizing the pathogen, the lungs of severe COVID-19 survivors could be severely damaged. A young woman needed a double lung transplant after fighting COVID-19 for two months in the ICU. A team at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago performed a double lung transplant on the patient, the first in America for a COVID-19 survivor. We've been dealing with the novel coronavirus for nearly six months, and there are people who still question the danger of the disease and minimize the virus's effects on the body. Then there are those who have experienced COVID-19, including survivors who have had to deal with a more severe case of the disease . One woman in her 20s survived COVID-19 after weeks of battling the condition with machines that helped her breathe. But she lost the function of both her lungs in the process, as they were so damaged by the fight with the virus that they would have killed her. The only way to save her life was to perform a double lung transplant, and that's exactly what doctors at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago did.",NWE,en,BGR
