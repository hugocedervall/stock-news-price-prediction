Online checkout has become inundated with payment options and data entry points, which leads to poor e-commerce conversion and frequent cart abandons. In recent months, one proposed solution has garnered support from major card network rivals Visa, Mastercard, Amex, and Discover. That solution has been dubbed Secure Remote Commerce (SRC). SRC is a set of specs that attempts to standardize e-commerce checkout across sites and devices. Instead of having payment information scattered across providers, SRC aims to put the entirety of customers' wallets in one place.

2020-12-04 14:03:00-05:00,MOBILE ORDER-AHEAD AND DELIVERY: How leading payments facilitators can help restaurants tap into industry demand and win volume,"Summary List Placement As the pandemic and subsequent stay-at-home orders slashed consumer spending and shuttered in-person dining, restaurant revenues took a substantial hit, especially at full-service eateries. And even as dining has reopened nationwide, ongoing capacity restrictions and consumer wariness have kept customers home and left engagement down by double digits. As restaurants continue to struggle to earn revenues, they've been forced to adapt their operations in order to keep their doors open. Implementing digital technology has become the core tool restaurants are using to stay afloat. The sector was already on the rise prior to the pandemic, especially at quick-service restaurants (QSRs): We expected mobile order-ahead annual sales volume would hit $31 billion this year. But the pandemic pushed restaurants to expand their usage of the technology for pickup, delivery, and even in-person dining, bringing penetration to levels not expected until 2023. And as ecommerce remains prominent across the board and the long-stretching pandemic cements newfound habits, the trend is likely here to stay.",MA,en,Business Insider

More than 163,000 small businesses in the US have closed since March , with many more struggling to stay afloat during the crisis.

In fact, 76% of small businesses in North America say the pandemic prompted them to become more digital. ""For business owners today, it's important to remember they are there today because of their customers, and so they have to be very aware of their customers' behavior and how their customers' behavior is changing,"" says Ginger Siegel, Mastercard's North America small business lead.

Finicity uses APIs to allow users to decide how their financial data is shared and who can make money decisions on their behalf. It leverages open banking to allow third-party apps access to consumer banking , transactional, and other financial data. Through the acquisition, Mastercard can offer its consumer and business customers greater control over usage of their data, strengthen its open banking platform , and provide more financial services options. The development and usage of financial services APIs in the US has been driven by private industry, though regulators have recently stepped up their involvement. Screen scraping, the technique historically used by aggregators to amass customer data, for some time granted fintechs unfettered access to all of a customer's financial data.

""Bitcoin has failed as means of payment"" is one of the prevalent criticisms of Bitcoin ( BTC ) that Fidelity Digital Assets is seeking to rebut. In a blog post published on Nov. 13, the firm took on six “persistent” criticisms, including Bitcoin's volatility, environmental wastefulness and use in illicit activities. Regarding the coin's purported failure as a means of payment for everyday transactions, Fidelity's argument is that this criticism fails to understand Bitcoin's core purpose. The currency is outperformed, Fidelity accepts, by conventional payment rails like Visa, Mastercard and PayPal, all of which can offer higher throughput. However, Bitcoin has been designed with other priorities in mind, including “perfect scarcity,” Fidelity argues. “Bitcoin makes deliberate trade-offs, such as limited and expensive capacity, to offer core properties such as decentralization and immutability. Given its high settlement assurances, Bitcoin optimizes its limited capacity for settling transactions that aren’t well served by traditional rails.” While the coin is, in theory, viable as a payment tool, its limitations mean that everyday use is not necessarily the end goal for the asset.",MA,en,Cointelegraph

The firms’ execs explain what’s at stake.,"Summary List Placement The relationship between banks and fintechs is complicated. Once seen as scrappy disruptors, fintechs have established themselves as a serious threat. For a majority of Americans, these consumer apps have become a key part of their financial lives. From peer-to-peer transfers to new forms of credit and no-fee bank accounts, fintechs run the gamut of personal-finance products. But the startup revolution hasn't occurred entirely independently. Fintechs still need banks, or at the very least, the data stored inside them. With many of their customers maintaining accounts at traditional financial firms, fintechs need to be able to connect and share information with their much larger peers. That's where companies like Plaid and Envestnet's Yodlee come in. These data aggregators sit in the middle, connecting third-party apps to various banks' systems. But in recent years banks have raised questions about the efficacy of these data aggregators, challenging their security practices or pushing to deny their access altogether .",MA,en,Business Insider

Active fund management is the art of a fund manager picking and choosing investments with the goal of delivering performance that beats a funds benchmark or index. The report provides insight into top active fund managers sentiments in the equity markets with some surprising stocks making it into the both overweight and underweight lists. Top technology stocks Amazon and Apple are among the three biggest underweight holdings, while financial services companies like Visa, Mastercard and PayPal are among the biggest overweights. In the October 19 report, UBS equity analyst Paul Winter leverages data from FactSet to calculate an investor weight and an active weight across all stocks. The investor weight is calculated by the sum of all holdings in dollar value across the managers and then the weighting of the stocks within this aggregation.",MA,en,Business Insider

For some it might be cutting down on meat or flying less, but now people can potentially help fight deforestation with their debit card. That's the idea behind TreeCard, a debit card made from wood launching in 2021. The startup has received $1 million in seed funding from Ecosia, the search engine which has planted more than 110 million trees. In partnership with Mastercard, TreeCard will offer a brand new wooden debit card to minimise plastic consumption, made from sustainably-produced cherry wood from the UK and recycled plastic bottles. Partnering with Ecosia means that for every £45/$60 spent on the card, the company can plant a tree and care for it for three years through the search engine's existing network of 38 tree-planting locations worldwide. TreeCard says it will donate 80% of its profits from interchange fees — the main revenue source for challenger banks — to deforestation initiatives and will be free to use.",MA,en,Business Insider

After his father suffered a heart attack in 2017, Cohen made a series of tough calls to spend more time with him: scrapping plans to take Chewy public, selling the company for $3.4 billion, and resigning as CEO the following year. Cohen broke with convention again by investing the vast majority of his wealth in two stocks , Apple and Wells Fargo, and later placing a contrarian bet on ailing video-game retailer GameStop. The entrepreneur attributes his independent streak to the ""two biggest influences on my professional life"": his father, Ted Cohen, who passed away last December, and Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO. ""Something critical that I learned from my dad and Warren Buffett was the ability to separate myself from the herd and think independently,"" Cohen told Business Insider this week. The pair's teachings allow him to ""block out the noise, develop my own point of view, and not be influenced by daily headlines or the consensus or what's in style."" For example, many people initially doubted Chewy would be able to ship 30-pound bags of pet food to customers and make any money. ""In the early years, few investors thought Chewy was a good idea,"" Cohen said. ""I struck out raising capital over 100 times."" Ignoring the skeptics, as well as avoiding distractions and saying ""no"" to all but the best opportunities, enabled Cohen to focus on the things most critical to Chewy's success: competitive prices, compelling products, fast shipping, and personalized customer service.",MA,en,Business Insider

After all, one reason investors love tech stocks is that they're remarkably efficient at making tons of money. But is there such a thing as too much of a good thing? Fund manager David Dudding of Columbia Threadneedle Investments says that sometimes, fantastic profit margins are a warning sign. While he's naturally looking for profitable companies and has substantial investments in tech, he says he wants to see companies that are planning ahead. ""We don't want to see margins sort of going through the roof, because maybe that's an example of companies taking too much profit in the short term,"" he said. ""What we like are companies [where] maybe the margins go up a little bit every year, but not as much as they could do."" Dudding says it's often wiser for companies to plow money back into advertising, product development, and other areas that will improve their businesses over the longer term. ""We quite like looking at things like R&D as a percentage of sales or advertising and promotion as a percentage of sales,"" he told Business Insider in an exclusive interview.",MA,en,Business Insider

In just four years, it accounts for more than half of digital retail payments — debit and credit cards clock around one billion transactions a month.While UPI has democratised digital payments, the ecosystem — UPI apps and banks — hasn’t reaped its due benefits. GoI’s continuous interference has made the growth of digital payments susceptible to uncertainty. Earlier this year, GoI mandated that merchants or sellers could not be charged any fees — merchant discount rate (MDR) —for accepting payments through UPI or RuPay cards. This fee is shared between the banks and the UPI apps. The business model for credit card companies is built on MDR, as merchants are charged for accepting credit cards.To make some money on UPI transactions, some private banks recently began charging for UPI transactions beyond a prescribed limit.",MA,en,Economic Times India

The investment will be dispersed over the next five years and will help underserved Black Americans access financial tools and support. Marla Blow, senior vice president of social impact for Mastercard, told Business Insider that protests in the wake of the killing of George Floyd brought added urgency to the firm's work toward racial justice. ""As a corporate leader, a Black woman and a former small business owner, I see very clearly the opportunity gaps that face Black communities. People are being left out and left behind,"" she said. Indeed, Black Americans face massive inequality when it comes to wealth accumulation and access to financial services, fueled by decades of racist policies .

Cash's share of total transactions at Square sellers fell seven percentage points to just one-third by August 2020, likely driven by three factors: Card payments: During the pandemic, customers turned away from cash payments to limit physical contact, in turn growing card usage. This could have prompted merchants, especially small businesses, to enable card acceptance for the first time or cease taking cash entirely for a period.

From in-store layaway to store-branded credit cards, retailers have always used financing as a way to convert browsers to buyers. But over the last several years, a cohort of fintechs have cropped up offering a new way for retailers to boost sales: buy now, pay later. From no-interest, two-week installment plans to longer-term financing, fintechs like Affirm, Afterpay, and Klarna, to name a few, have won over millions of consumers and tens of thousands of retailers with their digital-forward, easy-to-use alternatives to credit cards. It's no secret that e-commerce is on the rise with continued growth year-over-year for the last decade. And like other digitally-driven trends, the coronavirus pandemic has only accelerated growth in the e-commerce segment. In 2019, e-commerce accounted for 11% of total retail sales in the US. In 2020, total retail sales have been down, but in the second quarter this year, with brick-and-mortar retail largely shut down, e-commerce grew to 16% of total retail sales, reflecting a 44% increase quarter-over-quarter, according to the US Census Bureau .",MA,en,Business Insider

TCH claims it's set to add over 150 banks and credit unions to its network in the next few months, so it's seemingly on its way to expanding further. TCH's RTP network could quickly gain adoption during the pandemic because FIs may want to provide SMBs and consumers with fast access to funds. Many SMBs have faced a cash crunch during the pandemic, while consumers have dealt with unemployment and drops in income, meaning both groups need to be able to access the funds they have quickly.

As the DFA law is poised to be officially adopted in less than four months , Cointelegraph talked to major crypto firms operating in Russia to get their take on how the new law can impact their business.

Disruptive digital-only banks, innovative regulations, and shifting consumer demands have made today's banking digital-first — but the benefits of digitization are being held back by identity verification challenges. Identity verification underlies many of the core processes associated with financial services, with banks required to subject their customers to strict identity checks, both to protect those users' finances and to meet regulatory compliance demands. There have been a plethora of efforts aimed at streamlining identity verification online, but these attempts have largely failed to address the issue in its entirety.

In a report issued earlier in May, the VC firm posited that despite the apparently chaotic nature of the crypto market , each previous cycle has proceeded in roughly the same order.

A bad credit score is defined as anything below 580, according to the FICO scoring model, and anything below 601 according to VantageScore. If you currently find yourself in this credit score range, you probably won't get approved for popular rewards cards like the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card , but you do have some credit card options. Secured credit cards are particularly easy to get approved for, because you put up a cash deposit as collateral to get started, and there are also non-secured cards tailored to those looking to repair or build their credit. Using a card responsibly will help boost your credit over time, since keeping your credit utilization low and making on-time payments are the two biggest factors that determine your credit score .",MA,en,Business Insider

US retail and food services sales fell 21.6% year-over-year (YoY) in April, a steep deceleration from the -5.7% YoY growth the industry posted in March, per estimates from the US Census Bureau. And retail's performance is rapidly deteriorating during the pandemic, with retail and food services sales dropping 16.4% in April compared to March, nearly doubling March's -8.3% month-to-month decrease. This nosedive in sales is surely due to the coronavirus pandemic forcing stores to close and limiting consumer spending, and these factors could hurt retail's performance well beyond April.",MA,en,Business Insider

But the goal to advance partnerships so as to deliver the wider Sustainable Development Goals remains highly relevant to business and society at large. ""With the increasing importance of global value chains (GVCs), companies have a profound interest in building trade capacity in developing countries,"" says the consultancy PwC. ""Access to trade-related infrastructure, an educated workforce and quality standards for inputs to their goods are all critical to the success of corporate GVCs. Multi-sector partnerships, which pool the resources and know-how of different stakeholders, are well placed to drive action."" Public-private partnerships may have a decidedly mixed reputation and there are myriad horror stories involving smaller organisations partnering with large corporates only to steamrollered by their new supposed ally, but delivering on the 17 separate SDGs is such an all-encompassing endeavour it is impossible to see how it can be accomplished without a sharp increase in global co-operation.",MA,en,BusinessGreen

On the contrary, any such move takes away the incentive for intermediaries, who are vital for acquiring customers, Banga said in a telephonic interview. He was speaking to ET two days after the announcement that he would be elevated to the position of executive chairman.MDR is the fee charged by banks and payments companies from merchants or shop owners for providing them payment settlement infrastructure, or point-of-sale (PoS) machines.“Wherever in the world MDR has been reduced to the levels where it makes it uneconomical for the acquirer or issuer to participate in the natural business of electronic payments, you tend to lose the momentum.",MA,en,The Economic Times India

Drawing from the data, Quartz reports that ‌Apple Pay‌ currently accounts for about 5 percent of global transactions. If that growth trend continues, it may well become a long-term competitive threat to PayPal – and could even end up competing with Visa and Mastercard if it chose to set up its own payments network much further down the line. ‌Apple Pay‌ probably won't pose a challenge to the card giants anytime soon. While the tech company could, in theory, create its own network that runs outside the card systems, Bernstein argues that Apple still needs the card networks, which are ubiquitous and trusted. Visa and MasterCard, meanwhile, are used to dealing with partners (traditionally large card-issuing banks) with the kind of scale that even ‌Apple Pay‌ could muster.

The report notes that many Israeli businesses recently adopted the Europay, MasterCard, and Visa (EMV) standard for mobiles, allowing customer account credentials to be loaded directly onto NFC-enabled smartphones and used in contactless transactions. Unlike Android devices, Apple's devices don't allow access to the NFC chip through apps other than Apple's own Wallet app, which means financial bodies must sign an ‌Apple Pay‌ agreement that allows the card to be registered in the Wallet. However, it appears that Apple's fee demands could be a sticking point in discussions.

In fact, the 10-year Treasury yield fell below the three-month yield this morning for the first time since October as investors fled to Treasuries. That might be a psychological issue for some of the big bank stocks today, because banks have trouble turning profits when shorter-term yields rise above longer-term ones. Another worry—beyond the obvious human toll of the sickness—is how the virus might affect Chinese economic growth. A think tank came out yesterday saying China’s Q1 gross domestic product could fall to 5% or worse.",MA,en,Benzinga

2019-12-16 08:05:00-05:00,We interviewed Wall Street's 7 top-performing investors to get their secrets for success — and their best ideas for 2020,"Business Insider spoke with the seven best-performing large-cap fund managers of the year, based on a trailing one-year basis through the end of September. The fund managers outlined which thematic and single-stock strategies paid off for them this year, and they laid out their top trades and ideas for 2020. If you followed only financial-news headlines in 2019, you might assume the market had a tough year. Recession fears flared, trade-war tensions ebbed and flowed with ferocity, and corporate earnings growth slowed. Yet the benchmark S&P 500 was still up 19% year-to-date through the end of September. Thank the Federal Reserve and its overt willingness to continuing stimulating an economic expansion that's already the longest in history. But even amid a robust market environment that saw every major stock index climb for the year, a handful of fund managers stood out as the cream of the crop. These were the people and firms that were still able to outperform, even though equities and other risk assets were so strong across the board.","MA,MCD",en,Business Insider

Hence, it is the airline that is liable for payment and not MMT, they told the court. HDFC Bank’s lawyers, in the subsequent hearings, argued that the bank has deducted money out of a separate merchant account and has done it in accordance with a “merchant agreement” it has signed with its merchant, MMT, and that the bank is very much 'within rights' to do so as per the agreement.In an interim order on September 26, the High Court has asked HDFC Bank to keep the money it deducts from MMT in a “separate suspense account” and not to remit it back to the customers till the next date of hearing in January. “The matter is in court of law and is sub judice,” said Ateev Mathur, a lawyer representing HDFC Bank. “The bank is taking steps to file its reply before the court to challenge the claim, which the bank will do in accordance with law.”A spokesperson for MMT declined to comment saying the matter is sub judice.",MA,en,The Economic Times India

Jim Magats, PayPal's senior vice president of payments, product and engineering, told Business Insider the move was meant to offer customers more options and put PayPal at the center of a payments ecosystem. As part of the evolution of the network, the payment processor has started sharing its risk score with some large issuers, which has led to an uptick in approval rates. It is also plotting new ways to connect partner companies. Click here for more BI Prime stories. PayPal's July 2016 announcement of a strategic partnership with longtime rival Visa didn't spark an ideal reaction from investors. The deal was a big one for the payment processor and signaled a pivot towards collaboration.

From Sunday, India imposed higher tariffs on some US goods, days after Washington withdrew a key trade privilege for New Delhi.Two senior Indian government officials said on Wednesday they were briefed last week on a US government plan to cap H-1B visas issued each year to Indians at between 10% and 15% of the annual quota.There is no current country-specific limit on the 85,000 H-1B work visas granted each year and an estimated 70% go to Indians.Both officials said they were told the plan was linked to the global push for ""data localisation"", in which a country places restrictions on data as a way to gain better control over it and potentially curb the power of international companies.",MA,en,The Economic Times India

Given its fiat backing, Credit Suisse analyst Moshe Orenbuch said Libra should be relatively stable compared to popular cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. At the same time, earnings on the reserve of currencies should cover Libra’s operating costs, making the cryptocurrency itself and extremely low-cost option for digital payments. The combination of low transaction fees and fiat currency backing will make Libra an attractive method of sending cross-border payments, and Orenbuch said adoption in this area will likely be rapid.

After months of rumors, Facebook has finally unveiled Libra — its ambitious plan to transform how people use and send money globally using cryptocurrency. The company has released a white paper introducing the crypto, how it works, and 28 partner companies and organizations that are members of the Libra Association, an independent consortium that'll govern the crypto. Here's what we know about the project: Libra will be launched in the first half of 2020 and will be pegged to a basket of global currencies and short-term government securities. Pegging the crypto in this way is meant to reduce the volatility that's resulted in wild price swings for other cryptos. However, Facebook's approach means the crypto will not have a fixed exchange rate against a traditional currency, as stablecoins do. The crypto will operate on the Libra blockchain that is designed to handle 1,000 transactions per second, significantly higher than the seven that the Bitcoin blockchain manages in the same period, although still short of the 1,700 transactions Visa averages per second.",MA,en,Business Insider

The decision reportedly applied to both its retail store and digital platforms. Here's what it means: JCPenney's decision to stop accepting Apple Pay coincided with the April 13 deadline to support EMV contactless chip functionality. The retailer suggested that Apple Pay wasn't a popular payment method among customers.The Visa regulation deadline, which was initially set in October 2017, necessitates that legacy contactless magnetic stripe data technology be retired. In a statement to TechCrunch, JCPenney noted that it wasn't ready to comply, so it instead switched off all contactless payment options, which included Apple Pay. The retailer also explained that swiping or inserting credit cards is still accepted, which is ""an option employed by the vast majority of JCPenney shoppers,"" which could imply that Apple Pay wasn't a popular payment method among its customers.",MA,en,Business Insider

The comments from Ma elicited some intense reaction.“A load of nonsense, and didn’t even mention whether the company provides overtime compensation for a 996 schedule,” wrote one commenter on the Weibo post. “I hope people can stick more to the law, and not to their own reasoning.”“The bosses do 996 because they’re working for themselves and their wealth is growing,” another comment read. “We work 996 because we’re exploited without overtime compensation.”Representatives for Alibaba didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Ma’s comments come amid a fierce debate.",MA,en,The Economic Times India

The sanctions would target the elite and those loyal to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and would not impact ordinary citizens; the US would target restrictions to exempt transactions to buy food and medicine. The goal of this move is to block state-owned financial institutions’ access to the international financial system in an effort to cut off Maduro’s access to funds.

About 78% of workers in the United States are living paycheck to paycheck, and the statistics don’t improve from there. Only 39% of Americans actually have saved enough money to cover a $1000 emergency. Nearly 3 in 4 workers say they are in debt and of those, more than half think they always will be, according to statistics posted by Forbes . Any rise in interest rates or the cost of food could leave some Americans with the tough choice of eating or paying the car payment to get to work. A similar 2016 GOBankingRates survey found that 69 percent of Americans had less than $1,000 in total savings and 34 percent had no savings at all. That means many Americans would have to put an emergency expense on a credit card or borrow money another way just to cover the cost of a $1000 expense. Making matters worse, the 2017 Report on the Economic Wellbeing of US Households stated that, when asked how they would cover an emergency expense of $400, only 59% of Americans said they could easily cover the expense using entirely cash, savings, or a credit card paid off at the next statement.",MA,en,Zero Hedge

It covers an area of 104 acres, six times larger than UN headquarters in New York and ten times larger than the new embassy Washington is building in Beijing – which is just 10 acres. [Editor's' Note: The ten-acre US Embassy in Beijing is the second largest overseas construction project in the history of the Department of State — and the 104-acre US Embassy in Iraq is the largest.] So, America's largest diplomatic mission is surrounded by high concrete walls, is painted in black, brown and grey and is completely isolated from its environment…",MA,en,Zero Hedge

2019-01-07 08:46:06-05:00,"Bears To Bulls: ""Take The Blindfold Off""","Authored by Sven Henrich via NorthmanTrader.com, 2019 Market Outlook The cataclysmic action of Q4 left investors shellshocked as stocks plummeted and over 90% of US Dollar based asset classes ran a negative return for 2018 going against all Wall Street forecasts. Macro monsters from trade wars, Brexit, slowing growth, a slump in global property prices , political uncertainty, yield curve inversions, deficit explosions, technical breakdowns etc. are lurking everywhere, leaving investors blindfolded while trying to navigate highly volatile market waters in search for a safe destination in 2019. As we learned in 2018 : Extremes can become more extreme, long term trends matter, patterns matter, divergences matter, technical disconnects matter and now we’re dealing with the aftermath and their implications. My main market message for 2019: Pay close attention and stay fully informed. There are a lot of complex moving technical and macro pieces driving markets and the global economy that make for a very foggy outlook for the year ahead.",MA,en,Zero Hedge

2019-01-03 04:15:00-05:00,De-Dollarization Spreads: Why These 5 Nations Are Backing Away From The Buck,"The past year was full of events that inevitably split the global geopolitical space into two camps : those who still support using US currency as a universal financial tool, and those who are turning their back on the greenback . Global tensions caused by economic sanctions and trade conflicts triggered by Washington have forced targeted countries to take a fresh look at alternative payment systems currently dominated by the US dollar. RT has taken a deeper look into the recent phenomena of de-dollarization, summing up which countries have taken steps towards eliminating their reliance on the greenback, and the reasons behind their decision. China The ongoing trade conflict between the United States and China, as well as sanctions against Beijing's biggest trading partners have forced China to take steps towards relieving the dollar dependence of the world's second-largest economy. In Beijing's signature soft-power style, the government hasn't made any loud announcements on the issue.",MA,en,Zero Hedge
