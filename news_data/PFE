2020-12-09 17:16:49-05:00,Here’s why you’ll need to wear a mask even after you get vaccinated,"People who will receive coronavirus vaccines will still be advised to wear face masks for the foreseeable future, as researchers are looking to determine whether vaccination can prevent infection and whether immunized people could still be infectious to non-vaccinated people. The current lineup of vaccine candidates will not prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2, as they’re meant to reduce the severity of the illness and the risk of complications. Vaccinated people might still be infected with the virus in their nose, where the pathogen could replicate to large enough levels before antibodies clear it to be dangerous to non-vaccinated people. Surviving coronavirus doesn't mean you should stop wearing a mask. COVID-19 immunity research data shows that most people will develop a robust immune response, but some still risk reinfection. The same goes for vaccines. Drugs like the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have an efficacy rating of around 95% at preventing severe illness. But the immunity kicks in a few days after the first shot, and the best protection is attained a few days after the second injection.",PFE,en,BGR

However, many questions about its efficacy and safety remain, and if anything, the data suggests that more research on the jab is needed. Despite this, researchers confirmed they will now submit their data to regulators for approval to deploy the vaccine in mass immunization campaigns across the UK, Brazil, India and countries in Europe, among other places. Still, the peer-reviewed study, which can be found here, declared that the vaccine ""has an acceptable safety profile and has been found to be efficacious against symptomatic COVID-19"".

Overall, the findings are positive, with the study suggesting no major safety concerns for Pfizer's vaccine. Most immunized volunteers had temporary side effects shortly after being vaccinated. Those side effects included fatigue, headache, and pain at injection site. The US Food and Drug Administration is in the process of reviewing the COVID-19 shot for emergency use authorization, with a decision expected in a matter of days. An expert panel is set to meet Thursday to review Pfizer's application and recommend a decision to FDA regulators. Pfizer and its German biotech partner BioNTech tested their vaccine in a global study that randomized more than 40,000 volunteers to either get two doses of its vaccine or two doses of a placebo injection. While Pfizer said it had enough data to show its vaccine was a success at preventing COVID-19 — being about 95% effective — the company had to wait until November 20 to submit its application to accrue enough safety information.",PFE,en,Business Insider

The leading vaccine-makers are now aiming to produce hundreds of millions of doses of their shots. The global demand for a COVID-19 vaccine is likely to vastly outstrip supply, turning more attention to the ability of companies to pump out doses. The manufacturing challenge may be most dramatic for Moderna, a biotech upstart that has never before produced or sold a commercial medicine. Its flagship manufacturing facility in Norwood, Massachusetts, has never been inspected by the US Food and Drug Administration, yet will be depended upon to deliver millions of doses of the company's coronavirus vaccine candidate. Adding to the challenge, the leading vaccines from both Moderna and Pfizer are based on a new technology called messenger RNA, which has never before been used for a federally approved vaccine or treatment.

Some hospitals are using crisis management tactics, with six patients assigned to one health care worker, who spends their entire shift stabilizing patients.

While telehealth has been on the brink of taking off for years, consumer usage of the tech ticked up slowly before 2020.

The speed with which vaccines have been developed is incredible; the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is due to be used in the UK within days. But reaching the billions who need them worldwide may be even more challenging. It will depend not only on the technical capacity to produce and deliver doses, but on the behaviour of better-off nations. In the 2009 swine flu pandemic, high-income countries bought up all vaccine stocks.

El Gobierno nacional anunció ayer mismo que cerró un contrato con Pfizer para la compra de lotes de vacunas tan pronto estas puedan comercializarse.

Dr. Fauci recently suggested that live sporting events -- where tens of thousands of people are packed in together -- could return by September of 2021. Fauci's optimistic timeline, however, would require a majority of Americans to take a coronavirus vaccine. Even though we're now a few weeks into the NFL season, it's still a bit jarring to see games being played in stadiums without any sort of crowd. And while the NBA -- back when it was running its bubble experiment -- incorporated a digital crowd, there's simply no way to replicate the innate energy you get from a sporting event held in front of tens of thousands of screaming fans. The good news is that we have promising coronavirus vaccines on the horizon, and in turn, a lot of people are wondering when we might see now-empty sports stadiums and arenas bristling with fans once again.

The two groups encompass about 24 million Americans out of a U.S. population of about 330 million.

Spend any time on certain corners of Twitter or Reddit , and it will quickly become apparent that the idea that stocks only go up is more than a meme. While stocks have historically delivered on that narrative over the long term, one Wall Street expert says the same mindset on a short-term basis is as toxic as the housing narrative was in the 2000s.

Tyler Durden Mon, 11/23/2020 - 20:20 Daniel Lacalle, economist and fund manager at Tressis, joined Erik Townsend for an interview on this week's episode of MacroVoices. With COVID cases soaring in Europe and the US, markets are trying to balance the promise of a COVID vaccine, which has helped goose markets in recent weeks, with the risks of more restrictive public-health measures. With stocks near record highs, Townsend asks Lacalle for his view on whether markets are perhaps being too hasty in pricing in all this vaccine optimism. As Lacalle sees it, investors have lazily latched on to the positive headlines, while failing to really understand and analyze the risks that could create problems in the coming months. Vaccines Daniel : I completely agree. I think that markets are only accepting the positive newsflow without analyzing the real path to the widespread distribution of a vaccine.

COVID-19 survivors mount an immune response that’s detectable in the blood some eight months after infection.

AstraZeneca and Oxford announced interim data for their coronavirus vaccine candidate on Monday, making it the third vaccine out of three that were proven effective in Phase 3 trials. The Oxford vaccine might not have an efficacy rating as high as Pfizer or Moderna, but the drug has a few advantages. Not only is it cheaper to produce, but it can also be stored and transported at higher temperatures, making it ideal for use in places that lack the logistics needed for the other two drugs.

And then when Moderna announced that they had developed a successful vaccine for COVID, the world cheered even more. But COVID has been mutating, and scientists assure us that it will keep mutating. So what happens if the vaccines that are being developed end up being completely useless against new mutant strains of the virus? Would that put us all the way back to square one (or even worse)?

The only problem: the basket of most popular hedge fund shorts ripped even higher in 2020… ... which is why this has been another year in which hedge funds have failed to outperform the S&P500.

Let’s start with luciferase. Lucifer is Greek for “light-bringer,” and you might recognize the root in luminescence or translucent.

Markets seemed jarred by the exchange—futures on the S&P 500 Index (/ES) fell nearly 40 points in the early evening—but stabilized by morning and began the Friday session a little below the flat line. Treasury yields slipped a bit overnight, with the yield on the 10-year—which a week ago had been inching toward 1%—is back down to around 0.83%.",PFE,en,Benzinga

Early stage results from a study of the University of Oxford Covid-19 vaccine, published in the medical journal The Lancet, showed the jab triggered a robust immune response in healthy adults aged 56-69 and people over 70. The phase two research demonstrated similar immune responses from the vaccine, being developed with AstraZeneca, across all three age groups (18-55, 56-69, and 70 and over). The study of 560 healthy adults – including 240 over the age of 70 – found the vaccine is better tolerated in older people compared with younger adults. Volunteers received two doses of the vaccine candidate, or a placebo meningitis vaccine. No serious adverse health events related to the vaccine were seen in the participants. The results are consistent with phase one data reported for healthy adults aged 18-55 earlier this year.",PFE,en,HuffPost India

It encourages states and governors to band together and implement restrictions “focus[ed] on known sources of spread, such as bars and nightclubs.” Drs. Gottlieb and McClellan’s plea sounds reasonable. After all, ‘the science’ tells us that Covid spreads in confined spaces. Basing policy advice on ‘the science’ would be the sensible thing to do. These spaces — the restaurants, bars and cafes we enjoy — must be closed for our protection. But there’s just one small problem: ‘the science’ isn’t really there.

That feeling was deepened this morning when I heard that there was a genuine contender for a successful coronavirus vaccine in the near future.

Suddenly it felt like there was a way back to normality that didn’t involve repeated lockdowns and testing.

Of course, as WHO and the Gates Foundation struggle to raise some $18 billion for their 'Covax' program to help vaccinate poorer nations, we've seen some scientists warn that certain countries like India and others likely won't ever be able to distribute mRNA vaccines like those being manufactured by Pfizer and Moderna, due to the complexity of shipping and storing the vaccines, which must be kept at sub-zero temps.

"" To reach its ""startling"" conclusion, JPMorgan compared countries without lockdown, keeping the economy open under certain levels of social-distancing (Brazil, US, Sweden, Japan, Korea) to countries with strong curve intervention (UK, Germany, Italy, France, China, India) to see any meaningful differential in the curve development.",PFE,en,Zero Hedge

The news pleasantly surprised the medical community, as many doctors were expecting the first-generation vaccines to only work in 50% to 60% of people. Health experts agree these preliminary results are promising and exciting, but we still don’t have the full picture. We need much more data to understand which participants got sick and how severe their illness was. Researchers will also need to track the study participants in the months ahead to determine how the vaccine holds up over time. “It is a win for science, but the battle is not over,” Daniel Fagbuyi , an emergency physician who served as a biodefense expert in the Obama administration, told HuffPost.

AmInvestment Bank maintained its end-2020 FBM KLCI target of 1,530 points based on 16.5 times its 2021 earnings projection (+34.2%, after a 17.9% contraction in 2020).

When we compare the average 10 year effectiveness of the flu vaccine (44%) with vaccines for other diseases it falls well short and expectations were benchmarked around trying to beat this rather than compete with the most successful vaccines."" However, the early Pfizer number - which one must take with a ton of salt as it appeared not in a peer reviewed journal but in a corporate press release, and was oddly timed to hit just after the election - puts the vaccine effectiveness up there with that seen for Chickenpox, Mumps, Polio and Whooping Cough , which as Reid notes, is ""a long way to go but very encouraging.""

""For the COVID-19 disease, I think we'll roll out next year a vaccine in powder format."" A powder version would not require the burdensome cold-chain storage that's a key limitation of Pfizer's current candidate, which needs to be stored frozen at -70 degrees Celsius, or -94 degrees Fahrenheit. While the US and other developed countries can likely build up the infrastructure to deliver a frozen vaccine, it would be increasingly difficult to immunize people in poorer parts of the world. And even in the US, many state officials aren't sure how well they'll be able to deal with storage and transport requirements.

The speed with which this one has been developed – with others close behind – is remarkable. Detailed data has yet to be published, and much remains unknown , including how long individuals may be protected, whether it prevents infection and how effective it will be for older people, who are most vulnerable to Covid-19. There are still no guarantees it will be used, though manufacturing has begun. Nonetheless, this is a potentially transformative moment. Now it is up to the rest of us to do our part.

In yesterday’s post, “Investors Ignore Evidence,” we discussed the problems with the “fundamental backdrop.” Most notably was the more extreme valuation of the market currently. To wit: “There are two crucial points to take away from the data. There are several periods throughout history, where market returns were not only low but negative. (Given that most people only have 20-30 functional years to save for retirement, 20 years of low returns can devastate plans.) Periods of low returns follow periods of excessive market valuations and encompass the majority of negative return years.” Importantly, as I also noted, valuations are often dismissed in the short-term because there is no immediate impact on price returns.",PFE,en,Zero Hedge

So what do you need to know about the vaccine? We’ll walk you through what we know so far. 1. How it works It’s an mRNA vaccine, so it uses a bit of the coronavirus’ genetic code to prompt the body to initiate an immune response. While many standard vaccines work by injecting a dead or weakened form of a virus into the body in order to build immunity, RNA vaccines introduce a messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence into the body that contains the genetic instructions for the vaccinated person’s own cells to produce the vaccine antigens and generate an immune response.",PFE,en,HuffPost India

The coronavirus pandemic has created new challenges for almost everyone, has halted life as we knew it and has killed more than 235,000 Americans. As we near the end of this year (can you believe it?), we’re met with concerns about 2021 and a pandemic that is showing no signs of slowing down. “2021 for me is really kind of a mystery,” said Susan Hassig , an associate professor in epidemiology at Tulane University. “Everything is conditional on so many factors.” Many different scenarios can take place next year depending on what sort of vaccine and treatment options become available, in addition to how seriously the public follows rules set in place by public health officials. It also depends on what experts learn about the virus as time goes on. Things change every day, and so much of the shape of 2021 is dependent on many moving parts. But while there are no guarantees, there are some predictions. Below, we spoke with experts across the country about their expectations of what the pandemic will look like next year and what we can do as a society to make 2021 a more positive experience.",PFE,en,HuffPost India

Pfizer has not published any of its data, and has not submitted it for peer-review or to regulators for approval. What's more, experts say it's too early to know when the vaccine will be widely available to enough people to warrant ditching our masks and social distancing.

S&P emini futures were last up 0.1%, extending a rally in Wednesday's stock market trading session. Nasdaq 100 emini futures rose 0.5%. Democratic candidate Joe Biden predicted a U.S. election win over President Donald Trump after pivotal victories in Michigan and Wisconsin, while the Republican incumbent sought to offset a narrowing path to re-election with lawsuits and demands for a recount. Both Trump and Biden still had paths to reach the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win as states kept counting mail-in ballots. However, Trump now has fewer options to secure a second four-year term. A surprise win by Republican Senator Susan Collins in Maine dimmed hopes by Democrats that they could get control of the U.S. Senate. ""Even if Joe Biden wins the Presidency, it looks like we are going to have a divided congress so the opportunity to have meaningful change at the fiscal level is pretty slim, and that is what is being priced into the back end of the market today,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston.

Thankfully Robin McKie, the Observer’s science editor, has some good news on the race to find a vaccine The Observer’s science editor, Robin McKie , talks to Anushka Asthana about the race to find a Covid-19 vaccine. A total of 198 Covid vaccines are under development worldwide, with four key versions undergoing final phase 3 trials. These include Pfizer’s BNT162b2 and the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. Results of those trials – in which each is compared with a placebo – are expected in weeks or months. A vaccine that works is seen as a game-changer in the battle against coronavirus, which has killed more than 1.15 million people, shuttered swathes of the global economy and turned normal life upside down for billions of people. However, few think the first vaccines will be fully protective. They may instead reduce the severity of illness, so people avoid hospital and deaths are reduced.

The drug is called AT-527 and it’s currently in Phase 2 testing, with the final stage of clinical trials set for the first half of 2021. This new medicine is supposed to block the replication of the coronavirus inside the cell and prevent its ability to spread in the human body. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) formally approved Gilead Sciences’ Veklury (remdesivir) as the first treatment for COVID-19 on Thursday. The drug proved in clinical trials that it could help patients recover faster than traditional care. But remdesivir will not prevent deaths, a massive study from the World Health Organization (WHO) showed. The FDA’s approval followed the emergency use authorization that remdesivir received in May. But the FDA makes it clear this is the kind of COVID-19 therapy that “should only be administered in a hospital or in a healthcare setting capable of providing acute care comparable to inpatient hospital care.” The drug is administered intravenously, and it’s not the kind of therapy that can be used in a home setting.",PFE,en,BGR

The coronavirus pandemic has been a watershed moment for telehealth — or the use of mobile technology to deliver health-related services, such as remote doctor consultations and patient monitoring — as patients have had to reimagine the ways they seek healthcare. While telehealth has been on the brink of taking off for years, consumer usage of the tech ticked up slowly before 2020. The coronavirus pandemic has given consumers the push they need to adopt telemedicine on a wide scale — and we expect adoption to keep climbing so long as the pandemic rages on. Once outbreaks became severe in the US, consumers began flocking to telehealth: Telehealth usage among US adults climbed 6 percentage points month-over-month from February 2020 — when 11% of respondents reported having tried telehealth — to March — when 17% said the same, per a survey by CivicScience.",PFE,en,Business Insider

The FDA's vaccine advisory board, made up of external experts in infectious diseases, met Thursday to discuss the agency's standards for a coronavirus vaccine. Many the panel members voiced concerns about a vaccine being rushed out, and later proving unsafe or ineffective against coronavirus, per Bloomberg . This could ultimately undermine public confidence in COVID-19 vaccines for years to come, they said. The first test of these rules could come in late November, when Pfizer has said it plans to submit its vaccine for emergency approval . In particular, experts on the panel were worried about the FDA's rule that manufacturers must wait two months after giving a final dose to patients before applying for approval. This is not long enough, the experts said. Amanda Cohn, chief medical officer at the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in the meeting: ""Very rarely do we look at [vaccine efficacy] so shortly after completing a series.""

Johnson & Johnson did not disclose details about the patient or the illness, nor did it say whether the volunteer was on the experimental drug or a placebo. The company said that temporary pauses are standard for vaccine trials, and the FDA has not placed a regulatory hold on the study. There has been plenty of talk about coronavirus vaccine safety in the past few months, as COVID-19 vaccines have become a major political topic ahead of the November 3rd presidential elections. Just as Trump increased his vaccine rhetoric on the campaign trail , a new survey showed that more Americans are reluctant to get a vaccine when it becomes available. Top health officials including Dr. Anthony Fauci have made it clear that vaccines won’t get emergency approval unless they’re safe. On top of that, the FDA has just released new guidelines that make it practically impossible for pharmaceutical companies to apply for authorization before the election.",PFE,en,BGR

Morgan Stanley's equity strategy team think it's a firm ""yes."" Newly released economic data including expanding global purchasing-manager indexes, rising retail sales in the US and Europe, increasing global trade volume, and decreasing inventory levels are all pointing to an ongoing economic rebound, Morgan Stanley said in a Friday research note. However, it is the strength of the US consumer that cements the equity strategy team's view on the ""intact"" recovery, wrote strategist Adam Virgadamo, noting that ""US household personal income already reached 2% above pre-COVID levels in August."" Further driving the recovery will be the efficacy data from three coronavirus vaccine candidates in November. Under ""operation warp speed,"" the US government has purchased hundreds of millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses from Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Sanofi/GSK, and Novavax.

While White House officials had blocked the FDA from publicly releasing those guidelines , the man leading the US government's efforts to help develop a vaccine said he supports the FDA's decision. ""I do think it is appropriate to set the threshold of safety follow-up,"" Moncef Slaoui, the chief advisor to Operation Warp Speed, told Business Insider in a Tuesday phone interview.

But it was here that, if you believe President Vladimir Putin, Russia won the global race to develop a vaccine against Covid-19.Praising the developers at the state-run Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology, Putin declared in August that Russia had registered a shot for public use, making it the first vaccine worldwide to gain such clearance. Russia named it Sputnik V after the Soviet-era satellite that set off the space race in 1957 — a clear signal of the geopolitical importance Putin has attached to the project.The president’s live-TV announcement glossed over one key point.

If successful, a safe and effective vaccine would shift the challenge from science to logistics: ramping up production and distributing the shot across the nation and world. It's far from certain that any vaccine will have results so early. The studies depend on enough volunteers falling sick, so a board of independent experts can see if a group getting the experimental shots is getting less sick than people receiving a placebo.

Hoarding supplies of vaccines isn't just wrong, Gates argues, it's counterproductive - since the only way we can truly eradicate COVID-19 is to vaccinate everyone, in every country.

Tyler Durden Mon, 09/28/2020 - 14:40 Authored by Ron Paul via The Ron Paul Institute for Peace & Prosperity, In the Soviet Union it was forbidden to dispute the wisdom of the “party line.” That’s because Marxian communism was viewed as the scientifically inevitable progression of mankind. For Marx and Lenin, the “science was settled.” Therefore anyone speaking out against “the science” of the Soviet system must be acting with malice; must actually want destruction; must want people to die. Anyone voicing opposition to the “settled science” of Marxism-Leninism soon found their voice silenced. Oftentimes permanently. Ironically, just 30 years after the “science” of Marxism-Leninism imploded for all the world to see, we are witnessing a resurgence here in the US of the idea that to question “the science” is not to seek truth or refine understanding of what appears to be conflicting evidence.

The study captures the myriad of data surrounding the process by which inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are switched from one advanced therapy to another and corroborates Spherix's physician-reported data on the downward trend of branded TNF inhibitor use (namely AbbVie's Humira and Janssen's Remicade) due to the continued uptake of alternate mechanism of action (AMOA) agents, such as Takeda's Entyvio and Janssen's own Stelara.

What is needed to scale up to that level?I will give you a context before I get into the details of how we will reach $100 billion. The global pharma industry is around $1.3 trillion and within that, generics is around $270 billion and India accounts for 3% of the global pharma sector which is at $40 billion today. We are a very large exporting organisation, close to 19-20 billion of our industry’s output is exported and 40% of the export is predominately going to the US and some to the UK and other countries like South Africa. If you consider the patents that would expire over the next four to five years, roughly around $200 billion of generics would be coming into the market, which therefore makes global generics market move from $270 billion to $450 billion and that is a significant opportunity for the India market because we are a large exporting industry.",PFE,en,Economic Times India

The death rate from COVID-19 has been on the rise in the US once again for nearly a month following a steady decline after the initial spike in April. Gates also notes that we won't be able to get back to normal until a vaccine is ready. As bad as the second spike of the coronavirus pandemic has been in the United States, the silver lining was that the death rate had continued to drop even as our daily confirmed case count skyrocketed. Unfortunately, that trend ended in July, as the death toll began slowly creeping back up, and as of July 27th, the US was averaging over 1,000 deaths a day. This is the first time the seven-day average has been over 1,000 deaths since late May, but as awful as the US response to the pandemic has been, Bill Gates believes we will soon be able to control the death rate. In an interview with CNBC's Squawk Box this Monday , billionaire philanthropist and Microsoft's co-founder Bill Gates said that we will have therapeutic drugs to more effectively treat COVID-19 before the end of the year, but added that we won't be able to return to our normal lives until a safe and effective vaccine is readily available. “You can see the therapeutic benefit faster than the protective benefit,” Gates said. “So I think there’s a good chance we’ll have substantial death-rate reduction by the end of the year with the combination of those new tools.” During the interview, Gates mentioned remdesivir , which was one of the first treatments to show efficacy among those who had been infected with the novel coronavirus.",PFE,en,BGR

Vaccines that can block the novel coronavirus from infecting cells are our best hope to return to a sense of normalcy. And several vaccine candidates have already shown promising results. They can block the novel coronavirus with minimal side effects . But the critical Phase 3 trials haven't yet begun for several of these experimental compounds since tens of thousands of volunteers from around the world need to be enrolled in the trials.

But there are many problems with that vision, a primary one being: We're all going to need more than one shot. Research is coalescing around the idea that coronavirus antibodies dissipate after a period of weeks or months. Although our immune systems have more than just that one line of defense, those findings suggest that our immunity to the virus — whether generated in response to an infection or as the result of a vaccine — might be similarly transient. Because the efficacy of a vaccine hinges on its ability to prompt the body to generate antibodies that protect you from future infection, it's likely that people will need two doses of a coronavirus vaccine a few weeks apart for it to be effective.",PFE,en,Business Insider

In this gloomy situation, hopes for a cure have brightened with encouraging developments in both fronts, vaccines and drugs. SERUM INSTITUTE GETS READY FOR AZ-OXFORD VACCINE TRIAL The Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s largest vaccine maker, is readying the groundwork for the Phase III clinical trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. During the previous two trial phases, the vaccine managed to trigger an immune response among the participants and was established as safe. SII is awaiting approvals from the drug controller to start the trials in August. It expects to produce 400 million doses by December if the effi cacy of the vaccine is proven. INTERFERON-BASED THERAPIES Interferon-based therapies, commonly used in the treatment of infectious diseases such as Hepatitis C, have been successful in reducing deaths among severe Covid-19 patients.

2020-07-24 07:08:24-05:00,T cells take over when antibodies wane,"By Marthe Fourcade and Jason GaleAntibodies have become a familiar word in the pandemic era, perhaps suggesting they’re the best hope for keeping the deadly coronavirus at bay. But when crucial vaccine data was released this week, the spotlight panned to an unsung immune player: T cells.AstraZeneca Plc, Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE, as well as China’s CanSino Biologics Inc. all hailed the presence of these white blood cells in vaccine recipients as a sign their experimental shots show promise.Thrust into focus by recent studies, T cells are a reminder that the body’s defenses rely on more than one weapon, and that much of the immune response to Covid-19 is still a mystery -- especially after researchers revealed that the more lauded antibodies lack staying power.“Antibodies are only a very small part of the picture,” said Paul Griffin, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, who is leading clinical studies in Australia of two potential Covid-19 vaccines.",PFE,en,Economic Times India

We woke up to some hope around a possible new U.S. relief package and European strength, and then saw weekly jobless claims come in above expectations. Stocks gave up some of their initial futures market gains after the depressing data. New claims came in just above 1.4 million, up from 1.3 million the prior week and above analysts’ consensus of 1.28 million. Obviously, this is the opposite direction investors had been hoping for, and it means more tough times for many workers. The initial claims figure had been holding relatively steady near 1.3 million for a while, which is terrible from a historic perspective but at least it wasn’t going up. Now the question is whether this is a one-week blip or something more treacherous.

The patient chart analysis revealed that TNF inhibitor cycling remains the most common switch pattern among RA patients, though has leveled off over the past year after steady decreases since 2016. Nevertheless, the percent of patients being switched from one TNF inhibitor to another drops with each line of biologic/JAK therapy, as rheumatologists are more inclined to prescribe an alternate mechanism agent in the second- or later-line setting. While the percent of patients being switched to a TNF inhibitor stands unchanged from the prior year, switches to JAK inhibitors have increased in popularity – likely at the expense of the IL-6 inhibitor class, which had been experiencing year over year gains in the switch- to segment up until the current year (reverting back to figures reported in 2016).",PFE,en,Benzinga Feeds

2019-06-19 08:27:00-05:00,Sanofi is leaning on Google's AI and cloud-computing tools for drug advances (GOOGL),"This is an excerpt from a story delivered exclusively to Business Insider Intelligence Digital Health Pro subscribers. To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here . France-based pharma giant Sanofi is teaming up with Google to use the tech giant's AI and cloud-computing tools in a new Innovation Lab, per Bio Space. The goal of the partnership is threefold: to speed up drug discovery, maximize operational flows, and improve the patient experience. Using AI to streamline complex and costly processes is a budding trend within the pharma industry. Pharma giants are rushing to get a hold of AI. Eli Lilly struck a $560 million deal with San Francisco-based AI developer Atomwise — which also holds partnerships with Merck and AbbVie — to accelerate drug discovery earlier this month, and AstraZeneca tied up with UK-based BenevolentAI in May. It makes sense for pharma companies to lean on tech that makes drug development more efficient: Drug makers shell out $2.6 billion to develop a new prescription medication and bring it to market, up from the $1 billion it cost in the early 2000s.",PFE,en,Business Insider

2019-05-22 03:00:01-05:00,India’s Biggest Drugmaker Plans to Start Developing Its Own Medicines,"(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- You’d be hard-pressed to find someone who’s lost more during the recent upheaval in the generic drug business than Dilip Shanghvi: He forfeited $17 billion to be precise, plus the title of India’s richest man. After a four-year decline that erased 65% from the value of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., the drugmaker he founded, Shanghvi is preparing to bounce back. He’s doing it by borrowing a page from Big Pharma’s playbook: investing in higher-margin patented medicines rather than relying solely on copying drugs. That won’t be easy, especially when the multinationals that dominate the pharmaceutical business have already seen the payoffs from their massive research and development spending become more uncertain. Those giants are increasingly turning to acquisitions to fill out their pipelines, and that’s where Shanghvi also sees an opening. Aided by an ability to move quickly because of Sun Pharma’s relatively small size—it had only about $4 billion in sales in 2018, compared with Pfizer Inc.’s $53.6 billion—and streamlined decision-making, Shanghvi thinks the company can eventually pick up enough early-stage innovations and key personnel to generate half its revenue from patented medicines. “It does require some additional skills beyond what a typical generic has,” Shanghvi says, but those skills aren’t impossible to acquire.",PFE,en,Bloomberg

Domestic companies said they would defend these allegations. A Sun Pharma spokesperson said, “We believe the allegations made in these lawsuits are without merit, and we will continue to vigorously defend against them.”The US probe on price-fixing seems to have impacted the domestic pharma sector overall, with stock prices of most companies witnessing a drop on the BSE in the range of 4-9% on Monday.",PFE,en,The Economic Times India

Success in the biopharma industry has always been about patents. The exclusive right to market life-saving treatments is how all the industry titans made their names. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE ) both amped up on R&D and the ensuing patents. As such, companies rise and fall on these developments, and can spend months, if not years, researching, developing, and testing a new compound. When they're successful, these major breakthroughs can be worth billions in revenue for those who commercialize these drugs. Many biopharma companies, such as, AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV ), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE: TMO ), and ImmunoPrecise Antibodies Ltd (OTCQB: IPATF ) (TSXV: IPA ), are hitting home runs in the pharmaceutical discovery process, which lands them lucrative and exclusive contracts with big pharma.
