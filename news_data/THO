2020-10-09 08:14:00-05:00,Fund manager Brandon Nelson is tripling his benchmark in 2020 with 'less-discovered' companies that become big winners. Here are 3 themes and 9 stocks he's betting on.,"Summary List Placement Brandon Nelson has been running his mutual fund for almost 10 years, and Wall Street has been treating small-company stocks like the minor leagues the entire time. It doesn't bother him. Judged against his peers, Nelson is nobody's backup. His Calamos Timpani Small Cap Growth Fund has returned 252% in that almost-ten-year stretch, a return that tops that of the S&P 500, small-company indexes, and most of his peers, according to Morningstar. This year alone, Nelson had hauled in a 37.1% return as of October 7. Morningstar data shows that's more than double the typical return for the category and more than triple the gain logged by the Russell 2000 Growth index, his benchmark. He thinks investors' views of those companies are due to change. And when they do, even better times might be on the way for his sector. ""It's got a lot of fundamental strength and it's very inexpensive versus large-cap growth,"" he said of small caps in an exclusive interview with Business Insider. "" If money's going to reallocate away from large-cap growth , it seems to me, small-cap growth is a logical place to go."" Nelson says there are essentially two types of growth companies in his portfolio: Cyclical companies that will perform the best when the economy is firing on all cylinders, and secular growth firms benefiting from crucial trends.",THO,en,Business Insider
