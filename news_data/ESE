2020-10-02 13:00:00-05:00,"Worldwide Anechoic Chamber Industry to 2027 - by Type, End-user and Geography","DUBLIN , Oct. 2, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The ""Anechoic Chamber - Global Market Outlook (2019-2027)"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The Global Anechoic Chamber market accounted for $1.09 million in 2019 and is expected to reach $1.94 million by 2027 growing at a CAGR of 7.5% during the forecast period. Stringent government regulations related to electromagnetic interference across the electronics industry and the rising trend of outsourcing TIC services that need these chambers are propelling market growth. However, the high cost involved in electromagnetic compatibility testing is hampering market growth. An anechoic chamber is a room intended to absorb reflections of either sound or electromagnetic waves. They are likewise frequently separated from waves entering from their surroundings. This combination means that an individual or detector exclusively hears direct sounds, in effect simulating being inside an infinitely enormous room. Based on the type, the semi-anechoic chamber segment is going to have a lucrative growth during the forecast period owing to its ideal features which allow the user to constantly regulate background noise and also allows the user to test the components faster and have more accurate testing.",ESE,en,Benzinga
