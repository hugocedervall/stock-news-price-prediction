Nzambi Matee, a co-founder of Gjenge Makers, explains how it came about. ""So we started by collecting plastic waste and selling it to recyclers. That was in 2017, and then we realised three to six months later that we were collecting more waste than we could sell, than the recyclers could absorb. So that's when we decided what more we could do with the remaining plastic, as a value-added aspect, to see if we could put a product on the market using the plastic waste, and that's how we started making the paving stones"".

Thanks to positive vaccine news, the S&P 500 rose nearly 11% to deliver some of its best gains in the past 30 years while out-of-favor value stocks staged a massive comeback from their underperformance in the last decade or more. Since Pfizer's early November announcement that its vaccine had a 90%+ efficacy rate , Goldman Sachs' long/short value factor, which underperformed for most of the last four years, has surged 12% as of December 3, according to a Monday client note. For investors who have missed the value train, there are still other opportunities that have lagged the market but are well-positioned for the post-pandemic economy. Aside from cyclically oriented value stocks, S&P 500 dividend futures remain an attractive opportunity that trades at significant discounts, Chief US Equity Strategist David Kostin said in the note. While realized S&P 500 dividends per share fell by 5.6% year-over-year in the third quarter, many companies such as Darden Restaurants (DRI), Marathon Oil (MRO), and Estee Lauder (EL) that had suspended dividend payments earlier in the year due to COVID-19 impacts have now resumed, Kostin explained.",XOM,en,Business Insider

Dubbed Clean Creatives , the campaign is set to target PR and advertising agencies that deliver major campaigns on behalf of fossil fuel clients, with a plan to reveal the depth and scale of ""internationally concealed"" relationships between agencies and their fossil fuel clients. The campaign also plans to reach out to staff at major PR firms, as well as high profile directors and artists, via adverts and social media in order to drive up signatures to a new pledge committing firms to cease working with fossil fuel companies. And, in the coming days, a letter will be circulated among corporate networks and trade associations - such as the American Sustainable Business Council and the Ceres Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy - seeking support for the campaign, according to the Clean Creatives group.

We are still feeling the ripple effects of investigations five years ago showing that ExxonMobil Corporation’s staff scientists were well aware decades ago that petroleum caused global warming.

The Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) — which represents 12 of the world's largest oil and gas companies including BP, Shell, Exxon, Chevron, Aramco and Petrobras — revealed recently it is funding research alongside Stena Bulk into mobile carbon capture on board ships out at sea. The project aims to evaluate the technical and economic challenges involved in capturing CO2 from ships cruising the oceans, and is in part an extension to OGCI member Saudi Aramco's research which it claims has successfully demonstrated carbon capture on board heavy-duty trucks on roads, it said. ""Carbon capture will play an important role in reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions, but there's no reason it needs to be limited to stationary applications,"" said Michael Traver, head of OGCI's transport workstream.

The Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) - which represents 12 of the world's largest oil and gas companies including BP, Shell, Exxon, Chevron, Aramco, and Petrobras - on Friday revealed it is funding research alongside Stena Bulk into mobile carbon capture on board ships out at sea. The project aims to evaluate the technical and economic challenges involved in capturing CO2 from ships cruising the oceans, and is in part an extension to OGCI member Saudi Aramco's research which it claims has successfully demonstrated carbon capture on board heavy-duty trucks on roads, it said. ""Carbon capture will play an important role in reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions, but there's no reason it needs to be limited to stationary applications,"" said Michael Traver, head of OGCI's transport workstream. ""Expanding carbon capture to long distance marine shipping could help accelerate its use, while addressing a difficult to abate sector of the transport industry."" OGCI claims mobile carbon capture technologies aboard ships could help the global shipping sector reach its current climate target to cut emissions by 50 per cent by 2050, from a 2008 baseline - a goal that has faced criticism from green groups for lacking ambition.",XOM,en,BusinessGreen

We found that the company and its parents, Exxon and Mobil, misled the public about climate change and its severity. Central to this conclusion was the contrast between what Exxon and ExxonMobil scientists said in internal reports and scientific articles versus what Exxon, Mobil, and ExxonMobil told the public in non-peer-reviewed publications and in “advertorials” – paid advertisements dressed up to look like opinion pieces – in The New York Times. Newly leaked documents, reported recently by Bloomberg News, show that ExxonMobil’s climate dishonesty is even worse than we thought. While the company privately has an internal “plan for surging carbon emissions…by as much as the output of the entire nation of Greece,” according to Bloomberg, ExxonMobil executives “ shield their carbon forecasts from investors.” In other words, ExxonMobil drew up plans to expand fossil fuel production, internally calculated how much this would increase their carbon dioxide emissions, then failed to disclose those estimates to investors.",XOM,en,The Guardian

Meanwhile the V-shaped optimists are far back in 3rd place with just 19% of the responses.

But while the broader ""reflation vs deflation"" trade has been widely discussed here, and elsewhere, one more targeted trade that has seen less coverage in the media has been the divergence between the legacy energy sector, represented by the S&P Energy Sector and most easily observed by the continued slide in such energy titans as Exxon and Chevron, and clean energy.

""European peers have begun to reposition portfolios away from oil & gas production,"" the analysts said in the note.

In so doing, the SEC is dampening an important risk signal to corporate management and investors, especially with respect to environmental, social and governance issues. The change appears to have been heavily influenced by a network of corporate oil and gas interests, and is likely to be contested in court. First, some background. Shareholders in publicly traded companies have the right to vote on certain corporate matters.

""Also with the backing of very strong energy cash flows and partners like Microsoft/Google/Facebook, there is more confidence in delivering on these digitisation plans"", it added. RIL is now between 14 per cent and 17 per cent of the leading Indian equity benchmarks. Morgan Stanley India strategist Ridham Desai, sees two implications of the rising weight. First, passive flows keep rising. Secondly, and more importantly, given that several active manager mandates restrict ownership of single stock at 10 per cent of the fund, such active funds will likely continue to be underweight. ""Both these factors create virtuous demand cycle for the stock like we saw between 2006-2007"", Desai said. After listing in 1977, RIL reached $ 100 billion MCap in 2018 as the investment cycle slowed, but is now a $200 billion plus MCap company as it sears up to capitalise on India's $ 1.3 trillion plus TAM in new energy, e-commerceand digital ecosystem, with asset monetization as well.

The alarm was raised by research groups Amazon Watch and Stand.earth, who called oil extraction in the region “a gateway to deforestation and increased agricultural and industrial activity”. The banks that were reported to have backed the oil trade were accused of double standards, as all had made public environmental commitments, such as to the 2015 Paris climate accord, the United Nations sustainable development goals, and promises to protect forests.

We’ve spent decades promoting clean energy technologies. In this strangest of all years, as the death toll mounts from a disease caused by human incursions into once intact ecosystems, we’re observing another death — the demise of fossil fuels.

Writing in the Telegraph earlier this month, Opperman argued investors with environmental concerns should hold onto their stocks in oil and gas companies so they can ""nudge, cajole or vote firms towards lower-carbon business practices"". The Conservative MP for Hexham has since sought to clarify his position, arguing that divestment ""should be part of a strategic approach to managing pension schemes' exposure to risk, rather than something to be used by default"" but that ""forcing pension schemes to divest and sell their assets to others would be self-defeating and counterproductive"".

Here's what 'antitrust' means and how 'trust-busting' laws attempt to keep the biggest firms in US history from growing too powerful.,"Antitrust laws were created to keep the big conglomerates, or trusts, that were forming across oil, railroad, steel, and other sectors in the late 1800s and early 1900s from growing too large and powerful. Now, they're coming after 21st-century big tech. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Apple CEO Tim Cook will attempt to make their case as to why their firms aren't infringing on the competition in a hearing Wednesday. The hearing is part of a yearlong congressional investigation into online market competition. The ongoing investigation could eventually lead to more specific legislation designed to keep tech companies from growing too big and mighty — just like how three original antitrust laws began reining in the oil and railroad companies over 100 years ago.

At the same time, Brussels signaled that it will also encourage the development of ""blue"" hydrogen produced from fossil fuels paired with carbon capture, at least for the time being. The EU's new hydrogen strategy ( PDF ), announced Wednesday with coronavirus recovery efforts as the backdrop, sets a green or “clean hydrogen” goal to have 6 gigawatts of electorlyzers installed by 2024, a huge leap on the 250 megawatts in place today globally, according to Wood Mackenzie. By 2030 the EU wants 40 gigawatts of electrolyzers installed within its borders and another 40 gigawatts in place in nearby countries that can export to the EU — with North Africa one possibility. European policymakers have determined that hydrogen will be an essential tool to decarbonize industry and transport as Europe aims for a net-zero economy by 2050. (Read GTM's green hydrogen explainer here .) The EU's strategy says that blue hydrogen will be supported during a ""transition phase,"" although it is not specifically mentioned in the topline targets.",XOM,en,Green Technology (Feed)

Trends that were set in motion after the 2014 oil price collapse are likely to be exacerbated. We will discuss the African upstream trends observed over the last decade - providing some insight into the evolving strategies of regionally grouped companies and attempting to make sense of these in the context of the most recent crash. We will also look at exploration activity over the same period with the view to drawing insights from the 2014 crash and applying those to the current environment and outlook. A drama in three acts Three distinct periods are defined within the scope of this article, driven by crashes in the oil price: A) Pre-2014 crash Between 2010 and 2014, oil was trading in the region of USD 100/bbl and Africa was attracting significant interest from large European, North American and Asian oil and gas companies.",XOM,en,IHS Markit

Crude oil exports of the OPEC's second biggest oil producer exceeded 3.6 million b/d in May, with production having remained above 4.2 million b/d last month, much higher than its OPEC+ quota. Most recent data for June by IHS Markit Commodities at Sea suggests that crude oil shipped in the first half of this month fell to levels close to 3.2 million b/d. Iraq had exported more than agreed to produce in May. However, it's important to highlight that this doesn't seem to be an easy task for Iraq, with exports during the first week of June down to 2.9 million b/d, levels that couldn't be maintained for long, with exports returning back to 3.6 million b/d during the second week of June.

In the previous downturn, the Brazilian upstream market was concentrated around Petrobras to develop the presalt, with high local content rules and few bid rounds. In addition to the oil crash, the operator faced a perfect storm owing to a lack of cash flow and a paralyzing corruption scandal.

These will be the main drivers of the demand for AHTS that works in the anchorage, supply and installation activities associated with drilling and hook-up of new FPSOs or MODUs (mobile offshore drilling units). Adding to the reductions in the demand for new wells, Petrobras is hibernating several shallow water units, dropping also the demand for general purpose PSVs.

It is equally true, though, that what all these reports overlook is that the shale oil (and gas) sector is too important from a geopolitical and economic perspective to the world standing of the U.S. for it to be allowed to fail, and all other considerations are secondary. In reality, the U.S. shale sector is set to emerge stronger, and earlier, than the vast majority of people think. Ever since the 1973 Oil Crisis - when Saudi Arabia pressured OPEC members plus Egypt, Syria, and Tunisia to embargo oil exports to the U.S. (and the U.K., Japan, Canada, and the Netherlands) in response to the U.S.’s supplying of arms to Israel in the Yom Kippur War – the U.S. had been itching for a way to end its energy dependence on other countries.",XOM,en,Zero Hedge

The practice has become a target for environmental campaigners who have argued that supporting oil extraction runs counter to the tech sectors increasingly vocal pledges to tackle escalating climate risks and pursue net zero emissions goals. A Google spokesperson confirmed the move. ""Google Cloud is a general purpose infrastructure and data processing platform,"" they said. ""We therefore have companies from several industries using this platform to exit their data centres and run their IT systems on the Cloud.",XOM,en,BusinessGreen
2020-05-20 06:52:36-05:00,JP Morgan Chase climate shareholder resolution narrowly defeated,"Resolution's narrow defeat – at 48.6 per cent – sends a clear sign to bank that investors are increasingly displeased with its approach to fossil fuel investment. Shareholders at JP Morgan Chase have signalled a growing desire that the world's largest funder of fossil fuels curbs lending activities that exacerbate climate change. At the bank's annual meeting yesterday, 48.6 per cent of shareholders voted in favour of a resolution that asked the bank to report whether and how it would align its lending with the Paris Agreement goal of maintaining global warming well below 2C. ""Shareholders today sent the message that it is past time for Chase to catch up with its peers, implement a strategy to decarbonise and de-risk its lending portfolio, and help build a more secure future for all,"" said Danielle Fugere, president of environmental and corporate social responsibility advocacy group As You Sow. Despite the resolution not winning the majority necessary to pass, yesterday's close call is evidence of mounting pressure on the bank - which has invested more than a quarter trillion dollars in fossil fuels since the Paris Agreement was adopted - to emulate a growing number of its financial counterparts and strengthen its climate policies.",XOM,en,BusinessGreen

Total volumes exported from the 13 members in week 18 reached 25 million b/d, with shipments having only marginally surpassed 20 million b/d last week. The cartel seems to be rather decisive and immediately responding to its commitment to reduce production, in an effort to support oil prices in the global market. All eyes are now on Iraq, which has been considered the big OPEC+ deal cheater last year, as the country tries to reduce production without financially collapsing. Source: IHS Markit Commodities at Sea Iraq has been one of the least compliant members last year but was determined to meet its target within May. OPEC's second biggest producer has already informed some of its crude oil buyers that the full contractual volumes requested for June won't be met. Their customers who have been buying barrels from Iraq would need to replace these volumes with other sources.

2020-05-13 09:51:00-05:00,Renewable Yieldcos Take on New Light After Global Energy Shakeup,"U.S.-listed renewable energy yieldcos have fallen in and out fashion since they burst onto the markets early last decade. Where do they stand today as investors reassess the energy landscape in a post-coronavirus world? Leading yieldcos like NextEra Energy Partners, Terraform Power and Atlantica Yield all saw rapid rises in their share prices in late 2019 and early 2020. The surge came after years of lackluster performance that followed the initial yieldco boom and then bust of the mid-2010s. Yieldcos focus on the relatively low-risk business of operating wind farms, solar arrays and other clean-energy assets, and typically offer investors a generous dividend. The recent revived interest in yieldcos may have been driven by jitters over the outlook of other energy stocks, and particularly those related to fossil fuels. The main period of yieldco growth coincided with a quickening in the pace of renewables acquisitions by oil majors. In some cases, U.S. yieldco stock prices in February 2020 were the highest seen since the market's heyday in the summer of 2015.",XOM,en,Green Technology (Feed)

The Department of Energy, or DOE, said on April 2 it would offer to oil companies 30 million barrels of space in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or SPR. Later in the month, it said that companies were in contract negotiations for only 23 million barrels of space. President Donald Trump had ordered Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette in March to fill the reserve, which has about 77 million barrels of free space, ""to the top."" But an initial plan to buy about 30 million barrels fell through after the U.S. Congress declined to fund the purchase. The Energy Department did not immediately respond to a request for the terms of the lease contracts. The other companies leasing space in the reserve are Atlantic Trading, Energy Transfer, Equinor Marketing & Trading (US) Inc, Mercuria Energy America, MVP Holdings, LLC and Vitol, Inc.",XOM,en,The Sun Daily

2020-03-10 19:05:00-05:00,Only 4 Shale Drillers Are Still Profitable At $31 Oil,"Only 4 Shale Drillers Are Still Profitable At $31 Oil Authored by Irina Slav via OilPrice.com, Most shale oil wells drilled in the United States are unprofitable at current oil prices, Rystad Energy has warned. The Norwegian consultancy said, as quoted by Bloomberg, that drilling new wells would be loss-making for more than 100 companies. Just four shale drillers - Exxon, Chevron, Occidental, and Crownquest - can drill new wells at a profit at $31 per barrel of West Texas Intermediate. The problem is the nature of shale oil wells: while quick to start production and expand it, they are also quick to run out of oil, so drillers need to keep drilling new ones to maintain production , which is what U.S. shale patch players have been doing for years. However, this has affected investor returns, Bloomberg notes, and now it is affecting spending plans. “Companies should not be burning capital to be keeping the production base at an unsustainable level,” Tom Loughrey from shale oil data company Friezo Loughrey Oil Well Partners LLC told Bloomberg. “This is swing production -- and that means you’re going to have to swing down.” The situation is more positive for drilled but uncompleted wells, according to Rystad.",XOM,en,Zero Hedge
2020-03-10 19:01:14-05:00,Why 2020 is the crunch year for climate risk reporting,"Companies need to work out how to report their climate exposure or risk regulators stepping in, argues Verisk Maplecroft's Will Nichols Companies are clearly feeling the heat as investors ramp up pressure to address and disclose climate and energy transition risks. But organisations of all stripes are going to have to get much better at forecasting how these factors will impact business outcomes, because those who can't answer investors' questions will find it starts to affect their financial credibility. What's positive is that the ' disclosure gap' between investor expectations and the climate risk information companies are providing is closing slowly. Increased familiarity with the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFDs) is driving modest momentum: the percentage of companies (in all industries) disclosing information aligned with TCDF standards grew by between four per cent and 10 per cent across the four areas of business between 2016 and 2018.",XOM,en,BusinessGreen

While it is true that these companies make products that are bottled or contained in plastic, are they really responsible for the actions of consumers who throw the containers and bottles into the environment? The lawsuit, brought by the Earth Island Institute in San Mateo County Superior Court, asks for unspecified damages and seeks an order that the companies named in the lawsuit clean up the plastic waste that the group says has created a global pollution crisis. According to a news report in the Los Angeles Times on Feb. 26, “Group Sues Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Others Over Plastics Pollution,” the environmental group claimed it was suing on “its own behalf and to benefit several projects it sponsors: the Plastic Pollution Coalition, Break Free From Plastic United States, the International Marine Mammal Project, Shark Stewards and 1000 Fountains.” The environmental group has charged that the companies named have “implied that recycling can solve the pollution problem when they know that recycling systems are inadequate to handle the deluge of plastic waste,” said the article.",XOM,en,PlasticsToday

Jessica Nelson: Keith, I prefaced a little bit of that on the state of the conventional E&P, can you give us a summary of the current trends in exploration? Keith King: If we look at the last four years, we're discovering about 13 billion barrels a year. The world consumes somewhere around 55 billion barrels equivalent, oil and gas. So we're not replacing what we produce. And, we're also not replacing what we develop. So we're actually discovering less than we develop, and developing less than we produce.

The top tier of solar asset owners worldwide could change dramatically over the next 12 months due to the rapid ascent of a number of oil and gas companies, said Tom Heggarty, principal analyst in the energy transition practice at Wood Mackenzie. France's Total, which controls SunPower and already had around 3 gigawatts of renewable generation assets before buying into a 2.1-gigawatt PV portfolio this month, will almost certainly be one of solar energy’s biggest asset holders. BP, Galp and Shell could also rank among the dozen or so leading solar generators, Heggarty said. The oil and gas sector’s assault on the solar market is made easier by the fact that PV asset ownership is highly fragmented. The top 10 asset holders globally control around 10 percent of the 600 gigawatts or so of capacity installed worldwide.

The lower-sulfur crudes are more favorable for making fuels compliant with IMO 2020; the higher-sulfur crudes are the opposite.",XOM,en,Benzinga Feeds

Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape on Friday called off negotiations with Exxon on the P'nyang field, blaming the energy giant for failing to budge on a proposed deal that was ""out of the money"". The expansion of liquefied natural gas exports is crucial for the impoverished Pacific nation, but is vying with several proposed LNG projects in Australia, Mozambique, Qatar, Russia and the United States. One of Exxon's partners in the PNG project, Oil Search Ltd , said on Monday the terms the government had sought would have made the project unprofitable.

Corporate deals were signed in 23 countries last year, but the U.S. accounted for virtually all of the market’s growth.

So no pressure, then.The confusion has been thrown into stark relief this week at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, where oil majors, state oil giants and ministers have been debating behind closed doors in their biggest gathering of the year.While climate activists, notably Greta Thunberg, have called for all fossil fuel production to be halted to avert catastrophe, U.S President Donald Trump has decried ""prophets of doom"" and hailed the economic importance of oil and gas.""It feels like we are at the epicentre of this debate.",XOM,en,The Economic Times India

The journey towards crude production began less than five years ago when the consortium composed of ExxonMobil, Hess, and CNOOC made its first oil discovery offshore Guyana in the Liza field of the Stabroek Block. The block has an estimated recoverable resource of more than 6 billion BOE that is likely to increase as new discoveries are made.

The deal includes 900 megawatts of operational assets and a pipeline expected to yield a further 2 gigawatts by 2023. ACS, via subsidiary Cobra Concesiones, won 1,550 megawatts in Spain’s 2017 auction.

In 2019, a number of anti-plastic activist organizations have determined that, for all the nationwide attempts to make recycling a real solution to plastic waste, most plastics do not get recycled. Recently in numerous news articles, recycling is being called out as just another “greenwashing” scam, a picture being painted after 30 years of high expectations that have gone largely unmet. In a Dec. 18 editorial for GreenBiz , “It’s Time to Trash Recycling,” Ross Polk points out that “this house of cards is beginning to tumble,” as markets for many recyclable materials—including paper, glass, low-quality aluminum and plastics—have evaporated. He also notes that many Asian countries that used to accept these materials now reject them, sending the materials back to the countries of origin. Perhaps the plastics industry oversold consumers on the idea that recycling could solve the problems of plastic waste. When the push for recycling plastics began, which came after the success of collecting glass bottles and aluminum cans, there wasn’t as much plastic being used.",XOM,en,PlasticsToday

It accessed the government’s National Data Repository to study large amount of geological data to evaluate the possibility of an exploration bet, according to officials.ExxonMobil didn’t comment on its regulatory demands but said it was “keen to be a long-term partner in India’s energy journey”.“India has already taken a host of encouraging steps forward by facilitating access to seismic data, which is critical to enhancing the potential of success,” ExxonMobil said in an emailed response to ET’s query. “At the same time, developing the right contractual terms that secure stability and provide investor protection will go a long way in ensuring that projects are viable and help India compete for and win global capital.”The company has been engaged with the government on several regulatory aspects, seeking clarifications on some, and urging key changes on others, such as the freedom to the explorer to invoke international arbitration in case of a dispute with the government, according to officials.Current oilfield contracts provide for arbitration in India, which is not confidence-inspiring for some foreign companies, which think international arbitration mechanism is likely to be fairer to them.",XOM,en,The Economic Times India

2019-05-16 04:00:14-05:00,How to Make Money Off Rainforests Without Cutting Them Down,"(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- How do you save a rainforest? Create a national park, hardcore conservationists would say. That isn’t practical, though, if you’re a nation with 45 million acres of rainforest—an area about the size of Washington state—and a per capita income of just over $8,000 a year. “A tree left standing is not valuable to a family who can’t feed their children three square meals a day,” says Pradeepa Bholanath, head of planning and development for the Guyana Forestry Commission. With the help of international donors, Guyana, a country of fewer than 750,000 people, is pioneering an approach to protecting the trees that cover more than four-fifths of its surface. To make the rainforest last, it’s using it up slowly. Norway signed a deal with Guyana in 2009 offering it as much as $250 million to curb deforestation, and with it, climate change. Trees are one of the world’s oldest and best carbon-capture technologies; they absorb carbon dioxide from the air, store the carbon in wood, and release oxygen.",XOM,en,Bloomberg

2019-03-13 16:45:00-05:00,Will U.S. Supermajors Form A New Oil Cartel?,"Authored by Tsvetana Paraskova via Oilprice.com, The ambitious shale growth plans of the U.S. supermajors could in the future allow them to control so much of U.S. shale oil production that they could also control the price of the U.S. light tight oil going to foreign markets in an ‘OPEC of their own kind,’ Investing.com quoted John Kilduff, founding partner at Again Capital, as saying. If the U.S. supermajors, such as Exxon and Chevron, end up controlling a lot of the U.S. shale production with their plans to significantly boost Permian production, and if smaller shale players bleed cash and decide to sell acreage and operations to Big Oil, then supermajors could be the ones determining the price of light crude oil, according to Kilduff. Exxon and Chevron both announced increased targets for their Permian production last week. Chevron now sees its Permian unconventional net oil-equivalent production rising to 600,000 bpd by the end of 2020, and to 900,000 bpd by the end of 2023. Exxon revised up its Permian growth plans to produce more than 1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day by as early as 2024, which would be an increase of almost 80 percent.",XOM,en,Zero Hedge

In a statement released Friday, the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund, which derives its income from the country's oil and gas revenues, said it planned to sell shares of pure-play exploration companies, while holding on to shares of the biggest integrated producers. The Norwegian government approved the plan on Friday after a year of deliberation. It calls for shares of 134 companies classified as exploration and production companies to be removed from the FTSE Russell. Shares of bigger oil firms, like Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil, will remain. ""The objective is to reduce the vulnerability of our common wealth to a permanent oil price decline,"" Finance Minister Siv Jensen said in a statement. ""Hence, it is more accurate to sell companies which explore and produce oil and gas, rather than selling a broadly diversified energy sector."" Ironically, the proposal was hailed by climate activists in 2017 as a sign that an increasingly environmentally conscious Norway was looking beyond the carbon-based energy industry.",XOM,en,Zero Hedge

It’s the oil, stupid. But there’s way more than meets the (oily) eye. Caracas has committed the ultimate cardinal sin in the eyes of Exceptionalistan ; oil trading bypassing the US dollar or US-controlled exchanges. Remember Iraq. Remember Libya. Yet Iran is also doing it. Turkey is doing it. Russia is – partially – on the way. And China will eventually trade all its energy in petroyuan. With Venezuela adopting the petro crypto-currency and the sovereign bolivar, already last year the Trump administration had sanctioned Caracas off the international financial system. No wonder Caracas is supported by China, Russia and Iran.

2019-01-07 12:19:28-05:00,US Fracking Wells Are Producing Far Less Than Forecast,"According to a new report by the Wall Street Journal, thousands of shale oil wells that have been drilled over the last five years are pumping less than what was forecast to investors. The new discovery has raised questions about the strength behind the United States' newfound supply of shale oil. The WSJ compares well productivity estimates that were disclosed to investors versus public data of how these wells have performed to date; after analyzing 16,000 wells operated by 29 producers in places like North Dakota and the Permian basin , the Journal found that about 66% of projections made by companies between 2014 and 2017 are reportedly ""overly optimistic"". In total, these companies are set to pump about 10% less oil and gas than was forecast, an amount which equates to about 1 billion barrels of oil and gas over 30 years, which would be priced at about $30 billion at current market prices. In some regions, companies are reportedly off track by more than 50%. As previously discussed, the US shale boom has been one of the main reasons that the US has become an oil superpower over the last couple of years, while trimming the US reliance on foreign oil to virtually nothing.",XOM,en,Zero Hedge

2019-01-03 05:00:00-05:00,The Mediterranean Pipeline Wars Are Heating Up,"Authored by Viktor Katona via Oilprice.com, Things have been quite active in the Eastern Mediterranean lately, with Israel, Cyprus and Greece pushing forward for the realization of the EastMed pipeline, a new gas conduit destined to diversify Europe’s natural gas sources and find a long-term reliable market outlet for all the recent Mediterranean gas discoveries. The three sides have reached an agreement in late November (roughly a year after signing the MoU) to lay the pipeline, the estimated cost of which hovers around $7 billion (roughly the same as rival TurkStream’s construction cost). Yet behind the brave facade, it is still very early to talk about EastMed as a viable and profitable project as it faces an uphill battle with traditionally difficult Levantine geopolitics, as well as field geology. The EastMed gas pipeline is expected to start some 170 kilometers off the southern coast of Cyprus and reach Otranto on the Puglian coast of Italy via the island of Crete and the Greek mainland.",XOM,en,Zero Hedge
