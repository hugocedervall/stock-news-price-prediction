2020-04-28 12:55:41-05:00,Companies in ailing sectors like energy and retail are adopting poison pills as their shares tank. We tracked down 41 recent moves — and the activist investors they're fighting off.,"Over the past two months, at least 41 companies adopted poison pill contracts or filed to put them to a shareholder vote. Poison pills limit the stakes activist investors can take by giving the company the ability to sell new stock to existing shareholders at a discount if a trigger is hit. The measure was rarely used during the extended bull market, but desperate boards have turned to it now that activists are pouncing on cheap stocks. According to Reuters, which cited FactSet data, the 12 months before March only saw 34 poison pills. March was a volatile month for markets, which were rocked by the novel coronavirus pandemic, giving activists a cheap way into companies. Click here for more BI Prime stories. Activist investors are, in one's own words , ""price sensitive like any investor"" — meaning if the coronavirus pandemic made an investment much cheaper than it normally would be, they won't hesitate to take advantage. While activist defense lawyers have taken to the public-relations battlefield to attempt to shame activists out of pouncing during the pandemic, at least 41 companies looked to add an additional layer of protection in March and April: poison pill contracts.","TDW,TEN",en,Business Insider
