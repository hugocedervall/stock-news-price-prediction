Sign up here to get it in your inbox every week . Happy Friday everyone, The only constant in cannabis right now is that things move quickly — and what a week it's been. There was a slew of earnings this week, including Kush Bottles, a maker of cannabis packaging, and Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR), a cannabis-focused real estate investment trust, or REIT. Their earnings were two bright spots among a backdrop of slumping cannabis stocks, many of which have lost over 50% this year. IIPR operates on a sale-leaseback model, which in turn, helps cash-starved cannabis companies with capital. That's a good business to be in right now — the stock gained over 10% after it reported Q3 earnings on Wednesday, and continues to climb.
