The Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) investigated Apple Korea in 2016 for requiring SK Telecom, KT Corp, and LG Uplus Corp to pay the cost of television advertisements and warranty service for its iPhones. The probe found that Apple holds a clear advantage over local mobile carriers and that handing over the cost of advertisements was another means of squeezing the profits of the carriers. In June of this year, the antitrust regulator decided to allow Apple to map out a set of measures to address its anti-competitive business practices in the country, and Apple has now agreed to fix unfair terms with mobile carriers as part of its proposal. Apple said it will discuss how to share advertising costs with telecoms firms, which will help reduce burdens to carriers, the KFTC said in a briefing.",KT,en,Mac Rumors

2020-02-07 12:06:16-05:00,New leak might confirm the iPhone 9 release date,"While the iPhone 11 series has been an unmitigated success for Apple , not everyone is in the market for a pricey flagship phone. It's one of the reasons that Huawei is now the world's second-biggest smartphone maker just behind Samsung, but Apple has a plan to cast its net even wider in 2020 to attract consumers that might not otherwise have considered an iPhone. The key to this plan will be the iPhone 9, and thanks to a new leak from prolific spoiler of all things mobile, Evan Blass , we might know exactly when Apple's budget iPhone is launching. On Thursday night, Blass shared a screenshot of a calendar that appears to unveil the release timeline for upcoming smartphone launches. Not only does it reveal that Apple will announce the iPhone 9 (also frequently referred to as the iPhone SE 2) in mid-March, but it also says that Samsung's Galaxy S20 will begin arriving in stores and on doorsteps around the world on March 6th. The March 6th date lines up with a recent leak from Samsung's website .",KT,en,BGR.com
2020-02-06 11:19:48-05:00,A Korean mobile carrier may have just leaked Apple’s upcoming iPhone 9 release,"In addition to the iPhone 12 series this fall , Apple is expected to launch a follow-up to the iPhone SE at some point in the spring , but six days into February, there's still been no official word from the company about any event where the phone might make its debut. That hasn't stopped countless leaks from trickling out online, and now, we might have gotten confirmation of the phone's existence from an unlikely source overseas. On Thursday, Chinese technology news website cnBeta shared two photographs of a Korea Telecom (KT) retail store with signs out front promoting reservations for both Samsung's Galaxy S20 and Apple's iPhone 9 -- neither of which have been announced by their respective vendors yet. As you can see above, the signs look a bit sketchy, but KT is one of the three major mobile carriers in Korea, so we can't discount them entirely. Beyond potentially confirming the name and imminent release of the iPhone 9, the signs also suggest that preorders for the phone have either already begun or will begin soon.",KT,en,BGR.com
2020-01-06 04:56:41-05:00,South Korea starts universal super high-speed Internet service,"Seoul: South Korea has started offering super high-speed Internet services for the entire country that will allow universal, convenient access to online data, the government said on Sunday. ""High-speed internet has been designated as a universal service that everyone is entitled to receive no matter where they are,"" the Ministry of Science and ICT said. The ministry said the country's top fixed-line operator, KT Corp, has been tasked with providing the infrastructure in places that have not benefited from coverage in the past, Yonhap news agency reported. The move makes the country the eighth in the world to offer universal high-speed Internet to all citizens, but the transmission speed of 100 mega bit per second (100 Mbps) is the fastest by far, the ministry said. The US, Spain, Switzerland, Finland, Malta, Croatia and Sweden have all introduced universal service, although the average speed offered stands at 10 Mbps for the US with many others getting access speeds of just 1-2 Mbps. Asia's fourth-largest economy ranks No. 1 among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries in terms of fibre optic cable Internet connectivity penetration, yet it only started deliberating on the need to provide universal coverage in 2016.",KT,en,Sify.com
