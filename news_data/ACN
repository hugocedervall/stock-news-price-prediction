Starling also noted that it now has a total of 1.42 million retail accounts, up a strong 71.7% year over year (YoY) from October 2019. Its average retail customer deposit size surged 80.6% YoY, from £900 ($1,149) up to £1,625 ($2,074). Two factors are central to Starling hitting this important milestone: Its retail growth strategy is focused on long-term sustainability as opposed to short-term new customer acquisition. Starling considers its focus on sustainable growth over ""growth at all costs"" to be a differentiator : While it is the first of its peers to break the profitability barrier, it has far fewer retail customers—less than 1.5 million, versus Monzo's 4 million and Revolut's 12 million .

Recently when I was trying to setup an ESG themed Model Portfolio on a platform for a new client, I was told that I could not include UBS’s EM ESG Diversified Bond ETF because the backend gatekeeper had decreed that access to this fund was not an option – and neither were any other EM ESG Bond ETFs. UBS was the first ETF provider to trailblaze the ESG cause in the Corporate Bond space, and with that innovative step it became much easier to design a family of Multi-Asset ESG ETF Model Portfolios.

Most manufacturing companies still run most of their applications on-premises, but Gartner predicts that by the end of 2026, at least 80% of manufacturers worldwide will have adopted cloud applications built specifically for their industry. AWS, Microsoft, and Google Cloud have already devoted vast resources to winning over manufacturing customers, moving them over to the cloud, and building cloud products specially tailored for that industry. ""All of the cloud providers are investing in this space,"" Forrester principal analyst Paul Miller told Business Insider. As Google Cloud works to catch up to AWS and Microsoft in the cloud, it hired a former Accenture director — Suchitra Bose — as the new director of process manufacturing. Bose, who previously led Accenture's digital manufacturing and operations practice, will develop Google Cloud's manufacturing industry strategy , focusing on sales, partnerships, customer support, and more. ""[Google] sees this opportunity and sees their competitors have developed a beachhead first,"" Gartner senior research director Rick Franzosa told Business Insider. ""What manufacturers are looking for and what the vendors are looking for is really that utility, unlimited speed and storage, unlimited capacity in order to run applications."" Here's why cloud giants are keen on capturing more market share in manufacturing: Why Google Cloud, AWS, and Microsoft are betting on the manufacturing industry The cloud — including cloud-based AI tools — gives manufacturers the ability to process and analyze the vast troves of data that they have coming in from their machines.",ACN,en,Business Insider

But equity analysts and quant strategists at the bank are expecting that to change going forward as obstacles for value outperformance begin to fade. ""European value versus growth has yet to price in the macro recovery,"" Bank of America equity analyst, Sebastian Raedler, said in the note. Raedler identifies two obstacles in the way of value outperformance. Firstly, bond yields have not risen meaningfully in response to improving economic macro data. Secondly, two of the big European value sectors have continued to underperform —energy and financials. He expects with a maturing economic recovery this will translate to rising bond yields and an improving earnings cycle for these lagging sectors. The removal of these obstacles should translate to a 10% upside for value versus growth stocks by the first quarter of next year, Raedler said. ""[Bank of America quant strategists] argue that the cyclical reasons for owning value have strengthened: (a) their Style Cycle and US & EM regional indicators point to a synchronized pick-up; (b) EPS Revision Ratio for value stocks is the strongest since 2018; and (c) 90% of Fund Managers expect a vaccine in place by H1 next year, which should help to lift bond yields,"" Raedler said.",ACN,en,Business Insider

The insurer acted decisively, not only taking its systems offline, but also launching an investigation and employing an external cybersecurity firm to address the issue. Gallagher stated that although the investigation is in its infancy, the attack initially seems to only have impacted a limited part of its operations, and the insurer does not expect that it will lead to a material impact on its operations, nor its finances. Gallagher restarted its global systems on Monday. The ransomware attack is the latest in a long line of cyberattacks against financial institutions (FIs), which highlights the burgeoning threat they face amid lockdown restrictions. Large FIs' sizable total assets and vast amounts of customer data make them attractive targets—and as a result, malware attacks against FIs amounted to 25% of total global incidents in 2019 , a higher proportion than any other industry.",ACN,en,Business Insider

Now, it wants to apply that know-how to help brands like Pepsi and Champs develop products of their own with a new agency, Climate. Today, it announced the first leadership hires for the agency, Stanley Lumax, managing director; and Michael Tresvant, SVP of business development. Edgar Hernandez, CRO of Complex Networks, said the idea to start Climate grew out of having companies ask for help replicating Complex Networks' success with its own products along with events like ComplexCon, an annual event for streetwear fans in Long Beach, Calif. Climate essentially formalizes work that Complex Networks has already done in this area. It's made a limited-edition version of PepsiCo's Brisk with Anwar Carrots, a streetwear designer known for his graphic T-shirts; and developed online video series for Champs, for example, as Digiday reported. ""There were so many proof points in front of us — the number of people saying 'We want our own ComplexCon,'"" Hernandez said. ""We're betting this is going to be a big part of our business that could be as big as our media business over the next five years.""

2020-09-08 09:54:00-05:00,New data shows digital health was in trouble pre-pandemic,"Summary List Placement Before the coronavirus pandemic became severe in the US in March, digital health adoption was falling: In January 2020, 35% of US adults reported using a smartphone or tablet to help manage their health—down from the 48% who said so in 2018, according to a new Accenture report . The coronavirus pandemic pushed consumers to turn to digital health solutions en masse—but there are still roadblocks preventing health tech from reaching as wide an audience as possible. The pandemic catalyzed adoption surges for a variety of digital health services, most notably telemedicine and remote patient monitoring tools. In fact, if US consumers were asked about their digital health usage now, we estimate 50–60% would cite having used a digital care or health tracking tool since the pandemic has limited in-person care. But digital health companies still face hurdles to widespread deployment. Gen Zers' telemedicine uptake lags behind older adults'. Twenty-one percent of Gen Zers tried telemedicine as of May—compared with 32% of Gen Xers and 28% of Baby Boomers.",ACN,en,Business Insider

Nele, mais de 1 mil empresas signatárias firmaram o compromisso de que não demitirão nenhum funcionário até o final de maio. ""Nossa maior responsabilidade, agora, é manter nosso quadro de funcionários"", diz o texto.

The rejection rate has jumped three times in FY19 compared to FY15, according to an analysis of H-1B data from US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) by the National Foundation for American Policy.Indian nationals account for nearly 70% of all H-1B permit holders as global technology companies rely on such talent to work onsite in the US. USCIS follows the October to September financial year.“The denial rates for H-1B petitions have increased because USCIS has changed the standards for approval without new regulations or Congress passing a new law,” Stuart Anderson, executive director of NFAP, told ET.Denial rates for initial H-1B petitions or fresh applications stood at around 6% in FY 2015.“The denial rate for initial employment, primarily for new employees, has increased for nearly all leading companies but it’s clear USCIS adjudicators have singled out information technology services companies for the most restrictive policies,” Anderson said.Cognizant saw over 60% of its initial applications rejected, followed by Capgemini, Accenture, Wipro and Infosys.In 2018, the top six Indian firms got just 16% or 2,145 H-1B work permits, less than the 2,399 visas that Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, secured for its employees.Apple, Cummins and Walmart are the three companies that have seen no change in the percentage of rejections, according to the analysis of 27 top technology companies by NFAP.Immigration experts say such high rejection rates for work permits could hit talent movement and thereby the tech services companies’ ongoing business.“There is a problem… a sharp increase in denials.","ACN,AAPL",en,The Economic Times India

2019-06-24 09:18:37-05:00,Banks are cutting costs with tech – but the real benefit is yet to come,"This is an excerpt from a story delivered exclusively to Business Insider Intelligence Fintech Briefing subscribers. To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here . Commercial banks spent around $1 trillion between 2015 and 2018 on efforts to transform their IT, according to a new report from Accenture. Many of these investments were to adopt cloud technology and AI-powered analytics, with 30% of the IT spending used for new investments rather than IT maintenance. Out of 161 banks that were analyzed for the report, 12% were digital-focused, meaning they were fully committed to digital transformation, 38% were digital active, meaning that they'd put many initiatives in place to enable transformation, and the remaining 50% hadn't made much progress on digital transformation. Here's what it means: Focusing on digital has largely helped banks cut costs, but it's also resulted in reduced revenue growth. Digital maturity is associated with increased profitability. Digital-focused banks' revenue grew at a 3.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2011 to 2017, while their costs only grew at a 1.6% CAGR; so, they were able to increase their profitability over the years.",ACN,en,Business Insider

2019-04-05 16:30:59-05:00,David Droga reveals why he's giving up his cherished independence and selling Droga5 to Accenture Interactive (ACN),"David Droga sold his agency, Droga5 , to Accenture Interactive , despite having said in the past that he enjoys running an independent agency and had no intention to sell. But in an interview with Business Insider, he said he was excited about what Droga5 and Accenture Interactive could do together. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . If you've followed David Droga, his decision to sell his influential creative ad agency to Accenture Interactive likely came as a big surprise. Droga5 was one of the largest and most succesful independent agencies, and Droga himself has said he'd turned down multiple acquisition offers. In fact, in an interview just two years ago , Droga extolled the virtues of Droga5's independence, saying he had no interest in selling or being a part of a larger corporation again. So what changed his mind? In an interview with Business Insider, Dorga said he thought selling was the best way to increase his firm's influence and broaden the scope of its work. ""I want to build this incredibly influential agency,"" Droga said. ""I'm selfishly doing this because I think Accenture Interactive is going to help us, and they're the brightest partners we can have out there.""

Accenture Interactive wanted to add the creative talents of Droga5's team to its business, he said. The advertising giant has been focusing on helping clients rethink the way their customers discover and interact with their products and services. Whipple thinks Droga5 can help Accenture Interactive come up with imaginative new experiences for its clients. Accenture Interactive's deal to acquire creative agency Droga5 is more than it might seem on the surface, say the executives behind the merger. The planned acquisition, which Accenture Interactive announced Wednesday, will fill an obvious hole in its lineup.
