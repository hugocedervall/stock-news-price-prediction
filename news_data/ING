Many SMBs are on the brink of closing permanently in the wake of the pandemic. The crisis forced many to temporarily close and has caused drops in demand as consumers deal with financial difficulties and follow social distancing guidelines. The sudden drop in earnings, which may continue if pandemic conditions don't improve soon, could lead to wide-scale small-business closures in the coming months, and medium-sized businesses may be facing similar risks since the prolonged nature of the crisis is likely cutting into any additional resources and funds they have access to.

But equity analysts and quant strategists at the bank are expecting that to change going forward as obstacles for value outperformance begin to fade. ""European value versus growth has yet to price in the macro recovery,"" Bank of America equity analyst, Sebastian Raedler, said in the note. Raedler identifies two obstacles in the way of value outperformance. Firstly, bond yields have not risen meaningfully in response to improving economic macro data. Secondly, two of the big European value sectors have continued to underperform —energy and financials. He expects with a maturing economic recovery this will translate to rising bond yields and an improving earnings cycle for these lagging sectors. The removal of these obstacles should translate to a 10% upside for value versus growth stocks by the first quarter of next year, Raedler said. ""[Bank of America quant strategists] argue that the cyclical reasons for owning value have strengthened: (a) their Style Cycle and US & EM regional indicators point to a synchronized pick-up; (b) EPS Revision Ratio for value stocks is the strongest since 2018; and (c) 90% of Fund Managers expect a vaccine in place by H1 next year, which should help to lift bond yields,"" Raedler said.",ING,en,Business Insider
