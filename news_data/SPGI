And as those tasked with preparing those reports can attest, the process of gathering the data for them is frustrating and complex, especially as the level of detail desired and required by investors becomes deeper. That pain point was the inspiration for a new climate data project launched this week that will be spearheaded by the Linux Foundation, the nonprofit host organization for thousands of the most influential open source software and data initiatives in the world such as GitHub. The foundation is central to the evolution of the Linux software that runs in the back offices of most major financial services firms.

Spearheaded by non-profit the Linux Foundation, the LF Climate Finance Foundation (LFCF) aims to empower investors, banks, insurers, companies, governments, NGOs, and academia to use AI-enhanced open data analysis in order to address the financial threats from climate change. The LFCF said it plans to establish an open source climate data platform - dubbed OS-Climate - consisting of multiple physical and economic risk scenarios, a global and open 'data commons', and financial and economic models. Armed with that enhanced data, the aim is for members to collaborate towards developing predictive analytics tools and investment products ""that manage climate-related risk and finance climate solutions across every geography, sector and asset class"", the Linux Foundation explained.

2019-10-10 01:32:23-05:00,RBI's quashing of Lakshmi Vilas Bank merger fans contagion risks,"By Andy MukherjeeThe contagion risk from India’s year-old shadow banking crisis has suddenly turned much graver. What investors don’t know yet is whether the new problem is a $4 billion headache, a $16 billion migraine, or a life-threatening tumor.On Wednesday evening, the Reserve Bank of India quashed a proposed merger of Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd., one of the country’s largest real-estate lenders, with Lakshmi Vilas Bank Ltd.A marriage with a deposit-taking institution would have given much-needed relief to a shadow bank like Indiabulls, which has to support $16 billion in mortgages, advances against property, commercial real estate and other such hard-to-liquidate, long-term assets with loans from banks and the money market.That’s become increasingly difficult and expensive since the unexpected collapse in September last year of IL&FS Group, an infrastructure operator and financier. Meanwhile, the more immediate contagion risk comes from the $4 billion that the Indiabulls Group, which includes the housing finance company, owes the Indian banking system.Contagion EffectThe importance of a steady depositor base can be gauged by the single-day, 34% slide in Indiabulls Housing’s shares late last month.",SPGI,en,The Economic Times India

Here's why the $27 billion Refinitiv deal may be a winning bet.,"The London Stock Exchange is in advanced talks to buy Refinitiv, maker of Eikon financial-data terminals, in a $27 billion deal. The stock-exchange operator failed to merge with German rival Deutsche Boerse after regulators blocked the tie-up, citing competition concerns. While Deutsche boasts bigger profit margins, carries far less debt, and offered greater potential synergies, the Refinitiv deal has a better chance of winning regulatory approval. Watch LSE trade live . The London Stock Exchange is in advanced talks to acquire Refinitiv , the financial-data company behind Eikon terminals, in a $27 billion deal. While Refinitiv pales in comparison to Deutsche Boerse — a rival German stock-exchange operator that LSE tried to merge with — in some respects, the takeover has a greater chance of success. The 200-plus year old LSE has tried a few times, and failed, to merge with Deutsche Boerse. It also failed to tie up with TMX back in 2011. That failed too. The LSE is close to striking a deal with a private-equity consortium led by Blackstone, which bought a majority stake in Refinitiv from Thomson Reuters around 18 months ago.",SPGI,en,Business Insider
