Pesquisa da McKinsey & Company, divulgada no final de agosto nos EUA, apontou que manter a fidelidade do cliente é agora um desafio enorme para empresas. Segundo o levantamento, 77% dos consumidores adotaram novos hábitos nos últimos meses, como marcas, locais e métodos de compra diferentes. A volatilidade na fidelidade do consumidor deve se manter no pós-pandemia, segundo o levantamento. Para a McKinsey & Company, marcas terão menos chances de perder clientes se investirem no digital e em omnichannel, estratégia que engloba o uso simultâneo e inteligente de diversos pontos de contato com o consumidor, como voz, e-mail, chat de texto e redes sociais. Viviani Tacila, especialista em omnichannel da Bistro Estratégia, explica que o conceito se destaca no cenário atual ao colocar o consumidor no centro da experiência, integrando pontos de contato com o cliente. “O omnichannel permite criar um ecossistema de canais, considerando como o usuário se utiliza de cada um deles, e ajustando a abordagem e a linguagem para cada um”.",ZEN,pt,Valor Econômico
