2020-08-14 14:11:19-05:00,This revolutionary new coronavirus cure is already saving lives,"A breakthrough coronavirus cure might soon be available, as researchers are studying a drug that could eliminate the virus, calm the immune response, and repair damaged tissue. The drug is described in different ways: Medicinal signaling cells (MSCs), mesenchymal lineage adult stem cells, or adipose-tissue derived mesenchymal stromal cells (AT-MSC). MSCs therapy proved to be very effective in two pilot studies, saving the lives of many critically ill COVID-19 patients. A larger randomized trial is currently underway, with results expected in September. The novel coronavirus is an incredibly scary illness given the complex way it operates. It’s incredibly infectious and it can cause severe complications that can lead to death. It even kills younger patients and people who have no other underlying conditions. And some of the people who manage to recover after what could be a months-long battle with COVID-19 will have to deal with secondary health problems that could last a lifetime. That’s why you should avoid other people as much as possible, wash your hands often, and wear face masks until treatments and vaccines become available — and even after that .",MSB,en,BGR

2020-03-20 11:15:07-05:00,This Company Made Back Pain Therapies. Now It's Out For A COVID-19 Drug.,"Last week, Mesoblast Limited (NASDAQ: MESO ) was plugging away at therapies for heart failure, chronic back pain and rheumatoid arthritis. This week, it’s tackling the pandemic. COVID-19 may seem like a leap from back pain, but Mesoblast doesn’t see it that way. The disease pathways share a similar mechanism — one Mesoblast has targeted for some time. The Australian biotech’s proprietary platform uses allogeneic mesenchymal lineage stem cells to fight inflammation. Inflammation causes a variety of health issues, including arthritis, heart failure and the inflammatory lung disease that's complicating COVID-19 infections. Mesoblast has already spoken with a number of international collaborators and government regulators about a potential coronavirus therapy, and it plans to launch a random controlled trial in 48 patients “in the next few weeks,” said CEO Silviu Itescu. The biotech is trying to avoid being another casualty of the fatal virus. Its stock has plummeted more than 62% since mid-January, a fall Itescu attributes to the pandemic. “Markets will settle down as soon as people feel comfortable that the coronavirus issue is coming under control,” Itescu said in an interview with Benzinga. “It will come under control, and in that context, we believe that one of our products has the ability to be one of the mainline products for [high risk] patients.” Benzinga is covering every angle of how the coronavirus …",MSB,en,Benzinga
