The pandemic also delayed the launch of the company's residential battery system, as SolarEdge aims to compete with microinverter rival Enphase and other contenders in the fast-growing market for home solar-and-storage systems. Still, the Israel-based company reported strong third quarter results Monday, bolstered by an uptick in residential sales for its solar inverters and power optimizers in North America and Europe. Total revenues of $338.1 million rose about 2 percent from the previous quarter, driven by record European revenues of $165.6 million, up from $144.3 million in the prior quarter. While North American revenues fell slightly from the second quarter, installation rates and sell-through rates from its distributors were up, CEO Zvi Lando said in Monday’s earnings call. But the recovery from pandemic-related slowdowns in the second quarter hasn’t come to the commercial sector as rapidly as it has for residential, he said. “Commercial installations both in Europe and the U.S. and even in Australia are recovering slower than residential and inventories in the channel are still high,” he said.",SU,en,Green Technology Media

Japan just committed to reaching net zero, just four weeks after China did the same. In total, seven of the 10 largest economies in the world (not including America, India and Brazil) have made such commitments. And that's on top of all the subnational players, the corporates, and others. It's become increasingly clear that we're unlikely to reach net-zero at any significant scale without some pretty heavy carbon management. That means carbon capture, carbon removal, and carbon utilization. As a result, the carbon management sector has seen a frenzy of activity over the past couple years, ranging from research to investment to innovation. Just this year we've seen venture capital flow into companies protecting forests, sequestering carbon in the soil, capturing CO2 directly in the air, and converting captured CO2 into a range of products from cement to jet fuel.

Revenue and profit have surged and the stock has soared. Now Su is using that currency to snap up a company with complementary products that generate steady cash flow.Some investors and analysts were concerned that AMD might borrow heavily to pay for a Xilinx acquisition, repeating costly mistakes from more than a decade ago.",SU,en,Yahoo Finance

But what about the built environment? This week: we’re talking about the embedded emissions in our buildings. There’s the natural gas that gets burned in them, and there’s all the electricity that it takes to power them. And then there’s another category – all the upfront energy that went into making the buildings in the first place. That’s called “embodied carbon” or “embedded carbon” or sometimes “upfront carbon.” In the next few crucial years when we can bend the arc of climate change, most of the emissions that come from buildings are going to come from the embodied carbon. So how we choose to build buildings really matters. Our Podcast Senior Editor Ingrid Lobet has a special interest in buildings and wrote recently about embodied carbon for Greentech Media.

2020-09-14 10:50:00-05:00,The Cleantech SPAC Attack,"The market for initial public offerings dropped way down this year. Or did it? There is a surge in activity in a different kind of IPO: a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. It’s also known as a reverse merger. SPACs are shell companies listed on exchanges with a mission to buy private companies and convert them into public ones. According to a tally from Barron’s , there have been 70 IPOs through this method in 2020, with proceeds totaling $27.7 billion. It’s creating a path for little-known, pre-revenue cleantech companies to get access to public markets. There are now 10 companies related to the energy transition that have gone public or plan to go public through SPACs in 2020. Does all this frothiness make sense? And why is all this activity happening now? We'll explain on this week's episode of The Interchange .

Then, about two months after we first unveiled Wall Street's worst kept secret, the Financial Times also noticed that Corporate America is finding it hard to kick the share buyback habit, even after the US slipped into its worst recession in decades. Citing Credit Suisse statistics, the FT notes that while total buybacks are indeed expected to drop this year as the downturn caused by coronavirus saps corporate profits, companies in the S&P 500 that have reported second-quarter earnings so far have reduced the number of their outstanding shares by an average of 0.3 per cent from the previous quarter .","STT,SU",en,Zero Hedge

2020-07-28 11:53:00-05:00,Coronavirus Slows US Microgrid Market Despite Growing Need for Resilience,"The coronavirus pandemic has thrown a wrench into U.S. microgrid development, and may delay project origination and timelines over the next year, according to Wood Mackenzie’s latest review and forecast . The first half of 2020 was the slowest for the U.S. microgrid market since 2016, with only 58 megawatts of projects on the books, according to WoodMac’s survey of projects of at least 100 kilowatts in size. That’s a steep drop from the 291 megawatts of project installed in the first half of 2019. The slowdown is driven by shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders that have forced microgrid projects to delay permitting, construction and interconnection processes amid the country’s COVID-19 pandemic, microgrid analyst Isaac Maze-Rothstein wrote. That’s similar to the delays that have hurt U.S. distributed solar and energy storage deployments, which rely far more on being able to access buildings and work with local authorities to complete their work than do utility-scale projects Meanwhile, “some developers have expressed concerns around originating new deals as some customers wait to see how the pandemic and recession impact their core business,” Maze-Rothstein wrote.",SU,en,Green Technology Media

The US company has purchased a grand total of 93.4MW of onshore wind energy via virtual power purchase agreements (PPAs) split between Western Power Distribution's Corral Nuevo project in Spain and Falck Renewables' Brattmyrliden project in Sweden. Both projects are set to come online next year. Ball estimated its PPAs accounted for nearly 308,000MWh of electricity each year from the wind farms, or 63 per cent of the base load required by its European packaging plants, excluding Russia. The PPAs will help push the company significantly closer to its goal of fully transitioning its European operations to clean energy, it said. Kathleen Pitre, Ball's chief commercial sustainability officer, said that the renewable energy deals were evidence of Ball's ""steadfast commitment"" to slashing its absolute carbon emissions within its operations and value chain. ""Both projects will allow us to address a substantial portion of our European electricity use with new wind energy and accelerate progress toward our recently approved science-based targets,"" she said.",SU,en,BusinessGreen

Last year nearly 8,000 wildfires burned over 250,000 acres of the state, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Though the state’s 2019 wildfires were severe, 2017 and 2018 were the deadliest and most destructive fire seasons in California’s history, resulting in over 100 deaths and razing thousands of homes. The 2020 fire season will undoubtedly be challenging. Higher temperatures and a persistent drought driven by climate change have extended the duration of the state’s average fire season by 75 days. As of May, California’s snowpack was at just 37 percent of the average level, an indication of just how dry and combustible conditions are. In 2019 the reality of persistent wildfire risk led California utilities to implement preventative blackouts as a way to eliminate the risk of grid equipment sparking fires.

2020-04-14 14:16:00-05:00,Why Empty Office Buildings Still Consume Lots of Power During a Global Pandemic,"What happens to an office building’s electricity demand when almost everyone who works there is stuck at home? The coronavirus pandemic has forced broad swaths of the economy to shut down, as state after state forced non-essential businesses to close. The result has been significant drops in electricity demand in big commercial centers like New York City and the San Francisco Bay Area , and forecasts that commercial energy usage across the country will decline by 4.7 pecent this year . But just because a building is almost empty of people doesn’t mean that its energy use drops to nothing. Shutting down key building systems like heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) can lead to unhealthy air or corrosion in boilers and chillers. Emergency lighting and elevators must remain on, as must the servers running the business tasks being done by employees at home. Any equipment that was left plugged in when the office closed will still be using standby power. Office building energy consumption fell steadily through March and into early April, but it did not fall off a cliff, according to Hatch Data, which monitors 400 million square feet of commercial real estate for more than 250 clients.",SU,en,Green Technology

2020-03-05 13:08:15-05:00,"Inside the opaque $6 billion market for renewable energy 'certificates,' where dozens of companies buy and sell the right to call your electricity clean","Renewable energy certificates (RECs) are a little-known commodity, traded like gold or silver, which form the backbone of the clean-energy industry. Wind and solar power plants produce RECs for each unit of electricity they generate. Without those RECs, you can't technically call that electricity renewable — even if the source of it is. The price of RECs varies dramatically. In some markets, they cost as little as $0.50, while in others they're priced at $400 or more. Companies that say they source clean energy are often just buying RECs — and where those RECs come from matters. Buying more expensive RECs is more likely to fuel the growth of renewable energy. Oddly, if you lease solar panels for your roof at home, chances are you can't claim that your energy is renewable. That's because the companies that lease them to you likely sell the RECs to other businesses. Click here for more BI Prime stories .

That is the core warning contained in an analysis today by EV100, the non-profit campaign that has seen growing numbers of major companies pledge to transition their road fleets to 100 per cent electric models over the next decade. Having first launched in 2017, the number of EV100 members has now more doubled over the past year from 31 to 67 firms across 80 markets, including five new joiners announced today: Lloyds Banking Group, Zenith, Schneider Electric, Lime, and Danfoss Group. Together these companies' commitments amount to 2.5 million EVs driving on the world's roads by 2030, even before consumer demand is considered, and that number is expected to rise rapidly as more firms shift their fleets to run on battery power in the coming years, according to The Climate Group, which runs the EV100 campaign.",SU,en,BusinessGreen

Engineered on the trusted PowerLogic platform, the new ION9000T adds high-speed transient capture capabilities, helping critical facilities avoid outages, equipment damage, failures, and interruption of operations. Originating inside a customer' facility or from the utility grid, high-speed transient voltages can damage a facility's electrical systems and disappear before they can be detected, ultimately leading to poor performance, gradual breakdown, or abrupt failure. Industrial facilities can experience many such transients every hour, with voltage impulses exceeding 5 to 10 times the nominal system voltage. Discovering these harmonics and their root causes, and then taking steps to mitigate them, extends the life of equipment insulation.

2020-01-29 14:09:47-05:00,DistribuTech: Itron and Landis+Gyr Take Smart Meter Energy Disaggregation Mainstream,"SAN ANTONIO — Energy disaggregation is a term of art for technologies that can parse out energy usage of individual loads like air conditioning, heating, lighting and appliances, simply by analyzing single sources of data like smart meter feeds or circuit-level sensors. But this general term masks a variety of different approaches to this underlying data-analytics challenge, largely based on what granularity of data they can access, how quickly they can analyze it, and how deep a historical record they have to draw from. These differences are important to keep in mind when looking at two major energy disaggregation announcements out this week from two of the world’s biggest smart meter vendors , Itron and Landis+Gyr. Both are aimed at delivering much more detail on what’s happening with behind-the-meter loads. But each is going about it in a very different way — at least, at first.

T&D losses account for the electricity that is generated but doesn’t reach the customers. According to EIA, India’s T&D losses equal 20% of the total generated amount, which is more than twice the global average and nearly three times as much as the US.Highlighting other issues, the members also said that companies operating in the power utilities segment (generally dealing in distribution) are currently cashstrapped and hence they haven’t been able to buy power from manufacturing companies resulting in low power offtake.",SU,en,The Economic Times India

Most of those 187 developers* have only developed one project, and many of these developers are also the end customer. But 17 of them are not customers and can claim at least two projects each. This small group of developers has executed over 90 percent of the country’s microgrids. A new Wood Mackenzie insight outlines what these 17 top developers’ strategies say about the future of microgrid development. Technology-neutral versus product-led The 17 non-customer developers with multiple projects on the books all employ either a technology-neutral or a product-led strategy. They tend to have experience integrating many different distributed energy resources. These technology-neutral developers typically integrate a generation or energy storage asset on the customer site that predates the microgrid. These developers are generally microgrid control companies, energy service companies, or engineering, procurement and construction companies.",SU,en,Green Technology

The workhorse Power division was splitting up. Though still a top supplier of the world's natural gas turbines, it had turned into a money-loser as renewable adoption surged. Meanwhile, an expanded Renewable Energy division materialized with some 40,000 employees and billions of dollars in revenue. And GE's up-and-coming energy storage business took up residence in that new division under the Renewable Energy Hybrids brand. Previously, storage had nestled under Power, and before that it lived in the ill-fated Current unit, catering to commercial energy services. Years earlier GE tried and then abandoned a sodium-nickel-chloride battery manufacturing play called Durathon. As the first year under the new arrangement drew to a close, GTM sat down with GE Renewable Energy Hybrid Solutions CEO Prakash Chandra to hear how the industrial giant is leveraging energy storage to grapple with a changing energy market. “There's never been a lack of commitment to storage,"" Chandra said. ""I think we've tried to muddle through what is the best way to play in the space so we can add the most value in the entire value chain of storage.” The Durathon effort, which looks quixotic from today's perspective, developed as an effort to turn GE locomotives into diesel electric hybrids.",SU,en,Green Technology

The blackouts will continue as the company pursues a decade-long grid hardening project. Electric utilities bear the solemn mission of keeping the lights on, but PG&E's intentional shutoffs leave customers to fend for themselves. That divergence from standard operating procedure poses a question for the embattled utility: How will it take care of its millions of customers without power when the risk of starting a wildfire gets too high? The October fires and shutoffs inspired a flurry of commentary on how microgrids and distributed energy can save the day, by localizing power production in communities and allowing them to operate independently of the broader, fire-threatened grid. Though sensible in theory, microgrids must navigate a thicket of regulatory and logistical barriers before they become a meaningful tool during California blackouts.",SU,en,Green Technology
