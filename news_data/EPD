However, just like last week, it is commodities and specifically oil where the deflationary puke is taking place, with WTI tumbling over 5% at the open, and sliding to $17.30, down more than $10 from last Monday's post OPEC+ kneejerk reaction higher and the lowest price since November 2001, The ongoing crash in oil which OPEC+'s agreement to cut 9.7mmb/d in output last weekend has failed to halt, takes place as Crude prices in the US oil capital are getting dangerously close to zero.

2020-03-29 10:05:00-05:00,The Unthinkable Is Happening: Oil Storage Space Is About To Run Out,"The Unthinkable Is Happening: Oil Storage Space Is About To Run Out In the past three weeks, oil plunged and has continued to plunge even more in the aftermath of the oil price war declared between Saudi Arabia and Russia, and where US shale (and its junk bonds) has been caught in the crossfire. However, as we reported last week , we may get to the absurd point when the price of a barrel of oil not only hits $0 but goes negative. The reason: according to Mizuho’s Paul Sankey, at a whopping 15MM b/d in oversupply, crude prices could go negative as Saudi and Russian barrels enter the market. According to Sankey, much of the US 4MM bpd in crude exports will be curtailed as prices fall and tanker rates soar. And with US storage roughly 50% full, and able to take another 135MM bbl more, assuming a build rate of 2MM b/d, the US can add 14MM bbl/week for 10 weeks until full. As a result, there is a now race between filling storage and negative pricing ""unless U.S. decline rates can outpace inventory builds, which we very much doubt."" Said otherwise, absent dramatic changes, in roughly 3 months, energy merchants will be paying you if you generously take a couple million barrels of crude off their hands.",EPD,en,Zero Hedge

2020-02-18 01:56:57-05:00,A door opens: surplus ethylene to gasoline,"As the US has sought to exploit its hydrocarbon resources over the last decade, natural gas prices - which were once close to parity with oil prices in the early 2000s - have since diverged from oil prices. This shift evolved through the direct production of natural gas as well as gas production associated with oil development. The dynamic has transformed North America into a prolific producer of natural gas liquids (NGL), the feedstocks used in the production of petrochemicals. Given the plentiful supplies of these feedstocks and their inherent advantage relative to oil-based feeds, massive investment in grassroots petrochemical capacity - namely complexes dedicated to the production of ethylene - occurred to monetize the gas-linked feedstocks. In the past five years, nearly seven million tons of ethylene capacity were added in North America. This capacity addition is considered unprecedented, given that North American chemical producers took about 20 years to reach an almost equivalent amount of new builds.",EPD,en,IHS Markit
