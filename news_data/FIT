Before the pandemic, 39% of US office employees worked remotely—which nearly doubled to 77% during the pandemic, per a June PwC survey. Now, company leaders across the US are strategizing how to resume operations and restore normalcy by bringing their employees back into the office. In order to reopen brick-and-mortar offices, warehouses, and stores, it'll be of paramount importance for employers to navigate how to do so safely and instate routines that curb the spread of the coronavirus. Otherwise, employers risk creating sites of new outbreaks and being forced to shut their doors yet again. The pandemic could hike up employer medical spending—creating an even greater sense of urgency for products that help ensure workers are in good health. The pandemic could increase self-insured employers' medical spending by as much as 10% in 2021, per PwC's estimates .",FIT,en,Business Insider

Subscribe today to receive industry-changing health news and analysis to your inbox. The coronavirus pandemic has been a watershed moment for telehealth — or the use of mobile technology to deliver health-related services, such as remote doctor consultations and patient monitoring — as patients have had to reimagine the ways they seek healthcare. While telehealth has been on the brink of taking off for years, consumer usage of the tech ticked up slowly before 2020. The coronavirus pandemic has given consumers the push they need to adopt telemedicine on a wide scale — and we expect adoption to keep climbing so long as the pandemic rages on. Once outbreaks became severe in the US, consumers began flocking to telehealth: Telehealth usage among US adults climbed 6 percentage points month-over-month from February 2020 — when 11% of respondents reported having tried telehealth — to March — when 17% said the same, per a survey by CivicScience.",FIT,en,Business Insider

""A lot of what big tech brings to the table does not compete or overlap with what we're trying to do,"" Schoenberg said. Building the infrastructure that connects patients with doctors online, and abiding by all the rules and regulations in any given US state, took 15 years and millions of lines of code, he said. ""That has nothing to do with the ability to use one video server versus another, or with engaging consumers one way or another, or using different tools and elements,"" Schoenberg added.

2020-09-30 08:03:00-05:00,The Apple Watch's abnormal pulse readings are steering users to emergency rooms unnecessarily,"Summary List Placement A retrospective study conducted by physicians and researchers at the Mayo Clinic revealed that out of 264 patients who received an abnormal pulse detection using their Apple Watch, only 30 patients (11%) actually received cardiovascular diagnosis after visiting their provider—suggesting the Watch is churning a high number of false positive results with this feature. For context, the Watch's pulse feature is separate from its electrocardiogram (ECG) tool, which earned FDA approval in 2018. We think an uptick in Watch-generated avoidable patient visits will likely deter more healthcare institutions from striking deals with Apple. It's no secret that the tech giant has been using its Watch to push deeper into the healthcare arena: For one, it rolled out a blood oxygen measurement tool with its Series 6 Watch debut earlier this month, and is collaborating with UC Irvine and Anthem to test how blood oxygen measurement can help manage asthma. However, it might be difficult for Apple to leverage its Watch to broaden its roster of long-term health partners if it's doling out false positives: US consumers already cost the health system a whopping $200 billion annually in unnecessary tests and treatments, and healthcare entities are going to look for ways to mitigate—not compound—these sky-high costs.",FIT,en,Business Insider

As the last of the baby boomers settle into retirement by 2030, those figures are expected to rise by at least half and, if social care is added, possibly double by 2040.

2020-07-28 02:00:22-05:00,How Slack could reshape the entire Big Tech antitrust debate in the U.S.,"The House Judiciary Committee may now wish it had invited Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to join Apple’s Tim Cook, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, and Google’s Sundar Pichai at its upcoming hearing on antitrust . Microsoft, after all, was the defendant in perhaps the biggest antitrust case against a tech company in the last half-century, during the “ browser wars ” of the 1990s and 2000s. And now the company may be set to relive the whole thing after Slack complained to the European Commission about how Microsoft markets its Teams collaboration product. Slack says Microsoft is bundling Teams with its Office subscription suite in order to keep businesses from trying Slack by presenting Teams as a viable, and ostensibly free, alternative (the Office subscription product was formerly known as Office 365 and recently renamed Microsoft 365 ). “Microsoft is reverting to past behavior,” says Slack general counsel David Schellhase in a statement. “It created a weak, copycat product and tied it to their dominant Office product, force-installing it and blocking its removal, a carbon copy of their illegal behavior during the ‘browser wars.'” In the 1990s and 2000s, regulators in the U.S. and Europe punished Microsoft for bundling its Internet Explorer browser with its market-leading Windows operating system in order to freeze out the superior Netscape browser.",FIT,en,Fast Company

(AAPL),"Apple is expected to release a new Apple Watch in 2020, as it's done every year since 2015. The biggest new addition to this year's watch is expected to be sleep tracking, a feature that would help Apple catch up to rivals like Fitbit and Samsung. Otherwise, the next Apple Watch, which is expected to be called the Series 6, is rumored to come with faster performance and better water resistance. Here's what else we know. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . Apple has released a new smartwatch every year since 2015, and there's a good chance 2020 will be no different. While last year's Apple Watch brought improvements like an always-on display and a built-in compass, the biggest update expected to arrive on Apple's popular smartwatch in 2020 is support for sleep tracking. That seems more certain now that Apple has announced a new Sleep app for the Apple Watch, which will be part of the company's new watch software update coming in the fall. The app will display a sleep analysis chart showing your sleeping pattern for the week, and leverages the Apple Watch's accelerometer to gather movement data that can be used to tell whether you're awake or asleep.",FIT,en,Business Insider

The coronavirus pandemic has been a watershed moment for telehealth — or the use of mobile technology to deliver health-related services, such as remote doctor consultations and patient monitoring — as patients have had to reimagine the ways they seek healthcare. While telehealth has been on the brink of taking off for years, consumer usage of the tech ticked up slowly before 2020. The coronavirus pandemic has given consumers the push they need to adopt telemedicine on a wide scale — and we expect adoption to keep climbing so long as the pandemic rages on. Once outbreaks became severe in the US, consumers began flocking to telehealth: Telehealth usage among US adults climbed 6 percentage points month-over-month from February 2020 — when 11% of respondents reported having tried telehealth — to March — when 17% said the same, per a survey by CivicScience.",FIT,en,Business Insider
2020-06-02 04:22:23-05:00,Fitbit's share in global wearable device market drops to 3% in Q1,"San Francisco, June 2 (IANS) Among the top five wearables device makers, only Fitbit's shipments declined in the first quarter of 2020, leading to a smaller market share – from 5.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2019 to 3 per cent in Q1 2020, according to a report from International Data Corporation (IDC). Fitbit's shipments declined 26.1 per cent during the quarter as much of the company's production was based in China, which faced supply issues for multiple weeks during the quarter, IDC said in its Worldwide Quarterly Wearable Device Tracker report. While the company remains as one of the leading brands in the wearables space and still has a large user base along with promising tech, the lack of a hearable and strong competition from the likes of Apple and Samsung in key markets has suppressed the company's ability to grow, IDC said. In November last year, Google said it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Fitbit for $2.1 billion. Apple was once again the top wearables company with 29.3 per cent share and 21.2 million units in the first quarter of 2020.",FIT,en,Sify.com

Despite difficulties in the supply chain for Apple Watch , the company saw strong results thanks to its Beats and AirPods range (the report treats ""hearables"" as a subset of wearables). IDC put the strong demand for ‌AirPods‌ and Beats down to the ongoing health crisis and the increasing number of people working from home who are in need of headphones.

I've worn it daily for more than a month and primarily use it to keep track of my physical activity and sleep and to receive phone notifications. While it lacks the sleek sophistication of its $200 to $350 counterparts, it still impressed us with its month-long battery life and variety of features you'll use every day. Though Apple and Fitbit are probably the first names to come to mind when you think of wearables, Chinese wearables company Huami is quietly giving them a run for their money with its under-$100 Amazfit Bip smartwatch.
