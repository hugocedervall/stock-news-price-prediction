Numerous unnecessary employees at Twitter allegedly have the ability to reset users’ accounts and modify their security settings. This is a problem that Jack Dorsey, chief executive officer, and the company’s board were warned about all the way back in 2015. According to Bloomberg , Twitter has over 1,500 workers with the abilities to reset accounts and review user breaches. This led to speculation that the hack on July 15 could have been prevented if timelier actions were taken. Security concerns addressed The report clarified that such credentials gave limited access to most of the workers involved in the social network’s security department. They do note however that it is “a starting point to snoop on or even hack an account.” The “Risk Factors” section of Twitter’s 10-K annual report, filed in 2015 with the Securities Exchange Commission, or SEC, confirms that Dorsey & Co. had long been warned of this potential attack vector: “Our security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise.","ENB,ENBA",en,Cointelegraph

Prior to my vacation, I spent a few weeks talking to former employees and investors about what happened at Civilized , a cannabis media and events company that quietly laid off all of its employees after a takeover offer fell through. In the span of a little more than a year, the company's CEO, Derek Riedle, went from flying on private jets with celebrities to laying off employees without severance pay. Civilized's rise and fall is perhaps emblematic of what happened in the past two years in the cannabis industry, where the promise of a new multibillion-dollar industry met a more subdued reality, and greed got in the way of responsible decisionmaking.","ENB,ENBA",en,Business Insider

The irony is that markets are rallying on what is now openly fabricated Chinese data, because at the same time as China announced the sharp drop in new cases, it also reported that 108 of the 242 deaths ""observed"" the day before, had not actually been ""observed"", and were mistakenly double-counted , without offering any explanation how one can double count a death , and instead is proof that Beijing is now openly making up numbers on the fly.","ENBA,ENB",en,Zero Hedge

The North-American country accounts for around 25% of new crude oil supply to be added globally through 2050. New pipeline projects have so far faced significant delays, primarily due to environmental concerns and regulatory obstacles. Canada's proven oil reserves are estimated close to 170 billion barrels, coming third globally to Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Since Canada's domestic needs are only expected to grow slowly, exports will only continue to grow, assuming that the required infrastructure will be built along the western coast. Canada's exports to the US have reached 4.7 million b/d, with its heavier sour barrels remaining quite popular across US refiners, especially during periods of fast-declining output across other traditional suppliers to the US, such as Venezuela and Mexico. However, Canadian oil still faces some major challenges before further expanding.","ENB,ENBA",en,IHS Markit

2019-03-06 20:05:00-05:00,"Enbridge's Line 3 Pipeline Expansion Delayed In Latest ""Major Blow"" To Canadian Energy Industry","Enbridge Inc. is delaying the date when it expects its replacement Line 3 crude oil pipeline to be in expanded service, in what is being called a ""major blow"" to the oil industry in Canada. According to Bloomberg , the project had previously been set to begin shipping crude in Q4 2019. But now the company is pushing back construction due to slow permitting in Minnesota. Enbridge expects the pipeline to begin service in the second half of 2020 now, as its Minnesota permits won't be complete until November of this year. Federal permits won't be received until as long as 60 days after that. This pipeline was of importance because the government of Alberta was planning on using it to end mandated production cuts that were implemented to deal with a supply glut of crude oil. The glut has been a result of a lack of pipeline space, making it difficult to ship supply to refineries. The Line 3 expansion is set to cost $6.8 billion and help add 370,000 barrels of daily shipping capacity. Its delay is the latest of several blows for the Canadian energy industry, including the stalled Keystone XL pipeline and the stalled Trans Mountain expansion.","ENB,ENBA",en,Zero Hedge
