It wasn't the first time that Big Law attorneys struck it big investing in a client, and it probably won't be the last. Venture capital-style investments by law firms and their partners go back decades, with Cooley and firms including Wilson Sonsini and now-defunct Venture Law Group reported to take stakes in emerging companies. Before the dot-com bust, some of those stakes were valued in the tens of millions of dollars. Investing in clients has always been somewhat fraught, with some legal ethics professionals saying it can cloud a lawyer's professional judgment and lead to conflicts. That's why firms that do take a stake in clients often take a relatively small one, and often just for part of the fees that they charge, with the rest paid in cash, according to published accounts .
