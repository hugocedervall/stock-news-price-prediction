Addressing the 32nd AGM of the group, Kotak said the absence of requisite legal framework for group resolution under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) required the new board to propose the 'first-of-its-kind"" resolution framework that balanced interest of stakeholders across classes and levels, while keeping broad principles of corporate finance in mind. Resolution, restructuring and recovery formed the three vital pillars of the strategy adopted by the new board, he said. In October last year, the government had removed the sitting board members and installed a new board headed by Uday Kotak after the group defaulted on its loans. ""The combination of complex group structure comprising financial services, infrastructure and other businesses, high level of debt and diverse nature and type of creditors at various levels of the group represent a very unique scenario which is far removed from other well-known cases of distressed Indian companies in the recent past,"" said Uday Kotak, Chairman, IL&FS Ltd.",WM,en,Sify.com

2019-05-08 08:05:00-05:00,"China is refusing to take ‘foreign garbage’ from the US, so these 6 cities are burning or throwing away your recycling","A number of US cities have resorted to burning or trashing recyclable items as a way to save money. Prior to 2018, much of the country's recyclable waste was shipped to China, where it was sorted and converted into new uses. After China banned the import of foreign garbage, recycling companies started charging cities more to accept items like cardboard and plastic. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. If you throw your plastic bottles in the recycling bin, it may feel like you've done your part to conserve the environment. That effort could quickly be undone depending on where you live. As recycling becomes more expensive for local governments, many cities have resorted to incinerating recyclable goods or disposing of them in landfills. To understand how cities got to this point, it's helpful to trace the path of recycling in the US.
