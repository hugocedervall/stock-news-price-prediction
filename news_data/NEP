2020-05-13 09:51:00-05:00,Renewable Yieldcos Take on New Light After Global Energy Shakeup,"U.S.-listed renewable energy yieldcos have fallen in and out fashion since they burst onto the markets early last decade. Where do they stand today as investors reassess the energy landscape in a post-coronavirus world? Leading yieldcos like NextEra Energy Partners, Terraform Power and Atlantica Yield all saw rapid rises in their share prices in late 2019 and early 2020. The surge came after years of lackluster performance that followed the initial yieldco boom and then bust of the mid-2010s. Yieldcos focus on the relatively low-risk business of operating wind farms, solar arrays and other clean-energy assets, and typically offer investors a generous dividend. The recent revived interest in yieldcos may have been driven by jitters over the outlook of other energy stocks, and particularly those related to fossil fuels. The main period of yieldco growth coincided with a quickening in the pace of renewables acquisitions by oil majors. In some cases, U.S. yieldco stock prices in February 2020 were the highest seen since the market's heyday in the summer of 2015.",NEP,en,Green Technology (Feed)

2020-02-26 17:45:00-05:00,An Avangrid Yieldco? CEO Says ‘Maybe’,"After years of lackluster growth, renewable energy yieldco stocks recovered in dramatic fashion in 2019 — and Avangrid, one of the largest U.S. renewables operators, is paying close attention. Avangrid is open to the idea of launching its own separately listed yieldco company to house its huge portfolio of wind farms, chief executive James Torgerson said Wednesday. “With the yieldco market doing better, it’s something to at least think about,” Torgerson told analysts on an earnings call. “It’s obviously something we’re going to take a look at.” In addition to its collection of electric and gas utilities in the Northeast, Avangrid has long been one of the country's leading developers and operators of wind farms. The company owns around 6 gigawatts of operating renewables capacity, and built another 800 megawatts of onshore wind last year, trailing only Berkshire Hathaway Energy and NextEra Energy in annual additions. Through its Vineyard Wind joint venture, Avangrid is playing a leading role in the emerging U.S. offshore market.","NEE,NEP",en,Green Technology
