However, as Nomura's Charlie McElligott writes this morning, ""the “TL;DR version” of the U.S. reopening guidelines = there is no “plan,” as there are 1) no deadlines; there are 2) no guidelines or protocols to businesses on protective gear / temperature checks / testing / sanitizing; and 3) offers little to no federal assistance, with states being asked to “independently” secure PPE and medical equipment for their hospitals."" So why this tremendous surge in risk assets, which even pushed the Russell 2000 index limit up overnight? It is certainly not coming form hedge funds, which according to Goldman, saw the largest monthly dollar net selling since Aug '16 in the month though April 15, with all 11 US sectors sold MTD, led by Cyclical sectors.",TY,en,Zero Hedge

However, relying on CTA model estimates from Charlie McElligott, we said that it was unlikely that systematic (i.e. quant) investors had joined in the selloff, primarily because many of their forced-selling trigger levels were far below yesterday's S&P spot level. That said, we may well be witnessing the first wave of systematic liquidation today with Morgan Stanley anticipating some $60BN in forced liquidations today as a result of the continued selloff, a number which may rise substantially if the selloff isn't halted, and if vol continues to rise.",TY,en,Zero Hedge
