2020-10-02 09:12:00-05:00,Facebook is beginning the integration of Instagram direct messaging and Messenger,"Summary List Placement Facebook has been teasing the integration of its messaging apps since early 2019 and will finally do so by allowing users of its Messenger and Instagram apps to message each other, per The New York Times. Users can send pictures, videos, or text messages between Instagram and Messenger, and Facebook said it will add other new features to Instagram, such as the ability to send ephemeral messages, which will bring it up to par with Messenger. This unification comes amid slowing growth to Facebook's core platform. We estimate that Facebook's US user base will grow 2.8% this year to 177.1 million, with growth dipping to roughly 1% in 2021 and stagnating through 2024. Younger user growth is declining as they prefer other platforms: According to fall 2019 data from Piper Sandler, teens' favorite platforms are Snapchat, Instagram, and TikTok, with Instagram and Snapchat seeing the most engagement. As such, creating a more seamless user experience on Facebook's properties is a useful move in keeping the company relevant to younger users.",SNAP,en,Business Insider

Users will now be able to generate QR codes that are scannable from any third-party QR camera app. The feature will allow businesses to print and display a QR code that will direct customers to their Instagram account more easily, for example.

But it likely gets WeChat bumped off Apple and Google’s app stores in 45 days, which means at least suspending updates for a service vital to everything from engineers talking with iPhone assemblers to Chinese people video-chatting with family back home.If the ban extends to a block on its use, that threatens to eventually sever those ties because WeChat is the go-to for a billion people for everything from booking movie and train tickets to shopping, and alternatives like WhatsApp are blocked in China. The potential ructions underscore Tencent’s pivotal role within the global tech and internet economies, as a juggernaut with deep investments or connections with American businesses from Activision Blizzard Inc. and Snap Inc. to the NBA.“It would practically shut down communication between the U.S. and China,” said Graham Webster, China Digital Economy Fellow at think tank New America. “These orders just wrap the real issues up in political theater.”Trump’s order on WeChat came after a similar injunction against ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok, the viral video service the White House accuses of jeopardizing national security.",SNAP,en,Economic Times India

While there is an element of truth in the idea that welfare recipients can use some funds to buy marijuana, it’s not exactly as cut and dry as some media outlets have reported. One of the most controversial arguments against the legalization of marijuana — at least as far as regular people are concerned — is that welfare recipients will somehow be able to use the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to buy weed instead of putting food on the table. For several years, red-blooded Americans have been worried that welfare recipients are swiping their SNAP cards at cannabis dispensaries rather than at the grocery store. This fear of stoner socialism can be attributed to a story that began to spread years ago, shortly after Colorado became the first state to legalize for recreational use.

Instagram began testing the feature in Canada in May before rolling out tests to six additional countries including Australia, Brazil, and Japan in July. If Facebook does move forward with the tests, it would likely do so very gradually — and pull back if it senses the change will harm engagement in any way. Facebook is considering this change to improve user experience by lessening competitive pressure between users. By prioritizing likes, platforms encourage friends to compete with one another for attention. Ahead of its expanded tests in July, Instagram tweeted , ""We want your friends to focus on the photos and videos you share, not how many likes they get…We're looking forward to learning more about how this change might benefit everyone's experience on Instagram."" The feature could especially improve user experience for younger generations, as multiple studies have shown that social media use can hurt teens' mental health.",SNAP,en,Business Insider

The very first generation of wireless telephone technology was commercially available during the 1980s, while nowadays, most consumers are connected to a 4G LTE network on their mobile phones. 4G LTE technology provides download speeds upwards of 50 megabits per seconds. At the current bit rate, which currently goes up to 50 megabits per second, consumers can view a movie with little to no buffering interruptions or load a web page in a matter of seconds. Bit rates are crucial for various applications because they dictate how fast a consumer can access data. During peak internet usage, consumers can experience their upload or download speeds drastically slow down. Moreover, there are specific regions across the world that aren't covered by the 4G LTE umbrella network. The slow speeds and lack of coverage can be frustrating for many consumers and as a result, the demand for 5G technology has emerged over the past several years.",SNAP,en,Benzinga

On July 4 2010, Rob Hayes' family was not happy with him. He spent too much of the holiday on his phone, trying to organize an investment in a new, unproven startup. Hayes had learned about Uber a few months earlier when he saw a tweet about it from Garrett Camp. Camp founded Uber; he also ran StumbleUpon and sold it to eBay. Hayes' firm First Round Capital (FRC) had backed StumbleUpon. Hayes emailed Camp to ask what Uber was. Uber, Camp told him, was a startup that promised to solve transportation problems in San Francisco. Cabs in the city were scarce but with Uber, you could hail a nearby black car from your iPhone and it would pick you up in minutes.

The platinum blond teenager films herself singing show tunes, doing jumping jacks, and joking around with store clerks at a Walmart not far from her home in Oklahoma. Her short music videos and livestreams are popular—Jade has 284,000 followers, some of whom periodically send her virtual gifts, like 99¢ Rainbow Puke stickers. Jade’s parents resisted TikTok at first. They hadn’t heard of the app and, Jade says, “didn’t like the idea of strangers watching me sing alone in front of the pink curtains in my bedroom.” But she convinced them that TikTok was “friendlier for kids than other apps like Facebook.” They let her join last year, just as, it seems, every other teenager signed on as well.

Here's a clue,"The year was 1996 and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) cofounder Kanshi Ram was scouting for an ally for the assembly polls to expand the party’s base in Uttar Pradesh (UP). BSP had severed ties with the BJP over power sharing differences in 1995. With the 1993 guest house incident — when SP men attacked Mayawati after she pulled out support from the government — allying with Mulayam Singh was not an option. After several rounds of talks with PV Narasimha Rao of the Congress, a deal was struck. The Congress would contest 115 seats and the BSP 310 seats in the then 425-seat assembly. When the votes were counted, the party was left dumbstruck — the alliance won in just 100 seats. “The Congress does not have the capability of transferring its votes to any party. We will not have prepoll alliances with any party hereon,” Kanshi Ram had told his party workers after the results. His protégé Mayawati lived by this policy until recently. Now of course the unthinkable has happened and Mayawati has joined hands with Akhilesh Yadav’s SP to defend their political fiefdom against the BJP. 68540472 “Today, BSP is the only party that can claim to transfer all its votes to its allies.",SNAP,en,The Economic Times India

The in-app platform will have a handful of games from outside developers made specifically for Snapchat. Snap has a good chance at successfully driving engagement with games for two reasons: Tencent — the world's largest gaming company — owns a minority stake in Snap, and has expressed a desire to collaborate on a mobile game. Tencent, which owns Riot Games (“League of Legends” developer), bought 10% of Snap in late 2017.

2019-03-05 08:56:52-05:00,Kylie Jenner Has Just Become AOC's Latest Target,"Kylie Jenner is officially a ""policy error"". The youngest member of the Kardashian-Jenner clan has officially been anointed ""the world's youngest self-made billionaire"" - of course, if you remove ""self-made"" from the title it still holds true. Forbes arrived at this conclusion by factoring in her $100 million in cash, plus the now $900 million valuation for her booming ""Kylie Cosmetics"" business. Which could be a problem for the left, since, as a reminder, everyone's favorite freshman congresswoman (AOC) recently suggested that the mere existence of billionaires was both immoral, and a threat to American democracy . “I do think that a system that allows billionaires to exist when there are parts of Alabama where people are still getting ringworm because they don’t have access to public health is wrong,” Does this mean the left is now anti-Jenner? #BoycottKylie?

Late last year, an Orwellian gun bill was presented in New York state. If signed into law, anyone who wants to buy a gun would have to turn over three years of their social media history and one year of their internet search history. “A three-year review of a social media profile would give an easy profile of a person who is not suitable to hold and possess a firearm,” said Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, who has proposed the legislation with New York State Senator Kevin Parker. ( source ) Before purchasing a gun, applicants would have to turn over their social media passwords to accounts like Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram. They would also have to allow police to see a year’s worth of their searches on Google, Yahoo, and Bing. That law would also require anyone renewing their permit for a pistol to be subject to this invasion of privacy as well.",SNAP,en,Zero Hedge

Many of the top websites in 1998 were basically news aggregators or search portals, which are easy concepts to understand. Today, brand touch-points are often spread out between devices (e.g. mobile apps vs. desktop site) and a myriad of services and sub-brands (e.g. Facebook’s constellation of apps). As a result, the world’s biggest websites are complex, interconnected web properties. Today’s visualization, inspired by an earlier work published by WaPo , looks at which of the internet giants have evolved to stay on top, and which have faded into internet lore.
