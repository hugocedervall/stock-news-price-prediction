2020-10-07 10:10:00-05:00,Morgan Stanley expects more mega-mergers in the oil industry. Here are the 11 deals the bank says are most likely.,"Summary List Placement Hammered by a collapse in oil prices, the energy industry is entering a new phase focused on returns, which is likely to bring a wave of consolidation, analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note Wednesday. Deals could help US oil companies Exxon and Chevron diversify and build out their clean-energy assets, they said. ""European peers have begun to reposition portfolios away from oil & gas production,"" the analysts said in the note. ""Majors in the US have been slower to adapt despite sharing similar advantages of scale. Focusing on M&A in the power sector, companies with renewable development capabilities could be particularly attractive alternatives to oil & gas."" Today, the energy industry remains fragmented, the analysts said, resulting in a recent spike in deals. Most notably, Chevron acquired Noble Energy in early October through a $5 billion all-stock deal, while shale giants Devon Energy and WPX Energy announced plans to merge in late September.

""We expect that to continue."" The bank says future deals are most likely between companies focused on oil production, and among the largest integrated oil majors and smaller energy producers.","RES,RIG",en,Business Insider

The analysis, released this week, shows that the watchdog's planned crackdown on businesses breaching water, waste management, and agricultural rules has been intensifying, with RCP noting that there had been a ""significant step up activity in the lead-up to the UK's exit from the EU, amid fears that environmental standards could slip following Brexit"". Much of the agency's focus has been on the water industry, which saw investigations reach a record high of 1,807 in 2019, up sharply from 1,638 the previous year. However, enforcement action is also stepping up in other areas with the government recently announcing the creation of a new task force, the Joint Unit for Waste Crime (JUWC), which sees environmental regulators work with HMRC and the National Crime Agency to crack down on waste crimes.",RES,en,BusinessGreen
