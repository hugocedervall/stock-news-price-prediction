2020-10-06 06:53:08-05:00,Hedge fund short sellers claw back FTSE 100 losses as fresh Covid uncertainty sees bearish bets rebound,"Hedge fund short sellers claw back FTSE 100 losses as fresh Covid uncertainty sees bearish bets rebound Submitted By Hugh Leask | 06/10/2020 - 12:53pm Hedge fund short sellers have rebounded with a GBP418 million (USD542.6 million) gain from negative bets against FTSE 100-listed companies – just a month after losing almost the same amount from wayward shorts in UK blue-chip stocks. Overall, short sellers made gains from more than half of all FTSE 100-listed companies (53 out of 100), according to new data from Ortex Analytics, with Rolls Royce proving to be the most profitable wager, bringing in GBP187.7 million for bearish managers. September’s bounce-back marks a reversal of fortunes for hedge funds betting against FTSE 100 companies, an index often seen as a bellwether for investor confidence. In August, managers suffered a GBP420 million hit after UK equity market gains sent many sizable short bets southwards. Peter Hillerberg, co-founder of London-based equity research firm Ortex, noted that four of the five most profitable shorts in September had earlier been significant loss-makers in August, underlining how renewed uncertainty over the Covid-19 pandemic has underpinned the rebound. “Last month we saw a number of big trades turn sour for short-sellers which impacted overall profitability in August,” Hillerberg observed. “At the time, we predicted that the pendulum may swing back the other way in September and that’s exactly what we’ve seen as short sellers continue to profit from the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic.” Among the big bets to pay off were International Consolidated Airlines Group, owner of British Airways, Aer Lingus and Iberian.",JE,en,Hedgeweek

New data from London-based equity research firm Ortex Analytics shows almost three-quarters of total short losses in August came from big wagers against just five names: Ocado Group, InterContinental Hotels, International Consolidated Airlines Group, BHP and Pearson. Together, they accounted for a bruising GBP310 million loss out of a total hit of GBP420 million to hedge fund short sellers last month. As UK equities gained ground towards the end of the summer, hedge funds made gains from short positions in just a third of FTSE 100 names - 32 companies out of the total 100 in the index – as negative wagers in all sectors ultimately went awry. Hargreaves Lansdown proved the most profitable target for short sellers, delivering GBP26 million in August, followed by the National Grid (GBP17.6 million), HSBC (GBP16.2 million), and Royal Dutch Shell (GBP15.1 million).",JE,en,Hedgeweek

2020-06-12 11:23:23-05:00,Shifting Gears: People really hate Amtrak's new dining options,"There's no reason to ride a train across the United States. When I pitched a trip from New York City to Seattle last year, I didn't completely expect to get it approved — but I'm so glad it did. 2019 was Amtrak's best financial year on record, helped in part by record bookings and cost-cutting on food. That's where things get tricky. Nearly a full year after my first taste of the ""flexible"" dining that replaced full-service meals of the past, the agency finally responded to a FOIA request for the complaints about them. In 125 pages, riders opine on the lost service, which included custom cooked steaks, omelettes, pancakes, and even fresh seafood. After all, without the meals to look forward to, sitting on a train for multiple days becomes a bleak affair. And microwaved meals don't help. Now, it's unclear when — or even if — they'll come back. You can read the highlights and full document of thousands of complaints here.

2020-05-13 07:00:38-05:00,Report: Takeaway restaurants wasting 25 per cent more food since lockdown,"New report from Just Eat and the Sustainable Restaurant Association notes that while restaurant food waste is up during the coronavirus lockdown, takeaway consumers' attitudes towards food waste is showing signs of improvement. Takeaway restaurants are generating 25 per cent more food waste during the coronavirus lockdown as they cater to unpredictable ordering patterns, according to findings published today. A new analysis from the Sustainable Restaurant Association (SRA) and takeaway service Just Eat highlights how the average cost of food waste produced weekly in takeaway restaurants in the UK has risen to £148, up from £111 pre-lockdown. More than half the restaurants surveyed by Just Eat in April pointed to unpredictable fluctuations in customer ordering patterns as the main reason for an increase in food waste. The spike in waste from takeaway food during the lockdown amounts to a £16.7m worth of excess food waste overall, according to a figure crunched by the partners that assumes that all 65,000 restaurants in the takeaway sector have remained open throughout the lockdown. ""No business in its right mind wants to see its core product end up in the bin, especially not when it's costing almost £400m a year and contributing to a carbon footprint larger than the global aviation industry,"" said Andrew Stephen, chief executive of the SRA. ""Now is an opportune time for operators to review their menu, simplify processes, and design out waste."" Just Eat said it intends to provide more data and insights on ordering patterns to restaurants to help them better anticipate fluctuations in demand during the lockdown period.",JE,en,BusinessGreen

The variability of wind and solar power requires balancing to meet the demands of the system they operate in. While this is typically done at the system level — using dispatchable power plants, demand response, and other techniques — developers are seeing some advantages to integrating batteries on-site, making the wind or solar plant look more like a conventional power plant. Interest in hybrid plants is high, and hybridization can offer benefits relative to stand-alone plants, according to new research from Lawrence Berkeley National Lab and the Electric Power Research Institute. However, there are also limitations to hybridization, and market rules and policy incentives can make or break the finances of a project.
