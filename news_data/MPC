2020-04-29 03:46:13-05:00,Coronavirus (COVID-19) demand destruction has forced more than twenty refineries to temporarily cease production,"Last week, Marathon Petroleum began idling its 157,700 b/d Martinez (California) refinery in response to the demand destruction wrought by COVID-19. This is hardly the first refinery to be shuttered due to the pandemic and it will almost certainly not be the last. However, the shutdown is notable because Martinez is well-positioned within the California and the San Francisco markets, specifically, and one of the highest margin refineries in Marathon's portfolio. Moreover, Martinez typically produces little to no jet fuel, the refined product whose demand has been most affected by the pandemic. Figure 1: Refinery closures attributable to COVID-19 <span/> So, in many ways, Martinez appears a surprising victim (albeit a temporary one) of COVID-19. To be sure, <span/> the refineries that have so far been shuttered due to COVID-19 are - for the most part - small with relatively low conversion capabilities, whereas Martinez is larger with a very high conversion ratio. But there are a lot of other, less tangible, factors at play such as the nature of the refinery's marketing supply chain, the volume of available product storage capacity, and/or how it fits into the company's broader downstream portfolio.",MPC,en,IHS Markit

Marathon operates 16 refineries with capacity of 3 million barrels a day and is considered the nation's largest independent refiner following its acquisition last year of Andeavor, which had been known for years as Tesoro. The fact that diesel prices have not strengthened relative to crude — and in fact, have declined — has not thrown a wrench into Marathon's initial analysis of the way the rollout of IMO 2020 would take place, Henninger said.

2019-06-24 11:06:01-05:00,GOLDMAN SACHS: An investing strategy that's been left for dead is now poised to triple the market's returns. Buy these stocks to profit from the reversal.,"Value stocks have underperformed their growth counterparts throughout the 10-year bull market. It's been even more noticeable since the beginning of May, when expectations of an economic slowdown and interest-rate cut began to build. According to Goldman Sachs, there's now a wide valuation gap between cheap and expensive stocks that could close in favor of bargain hunters. Goldman's equity analysts updated their basket of cheap stocks with the highest expected returns relative to their six-month implied volatilities. Click here for more BI Prime stories . Bargain hunting in the stock market isn't what it used to be. The strategy of buying stocks that are trading cheaply relative to the broader market — so-called value investing — has lagged since the financial crisis. In this lengthy bull market, investors have earned greater returns by buying richly valued stocks that hold the promise of strong earnings growth, particularly those in the technology sector. This dynamic has notably been at play since early May, when investors began to reassess their expectations for economic growth and the Federal Reserve this year, according to equity strategists at Goldman Sachs.",MPC,en,Business Insider
