2020-09-15 07:15:00-05:00,Morgan Stanley pinpoints the most attractive opportunity it sees for investors as a new bull run takes shape — and shares 3 strategies for generating market-beating returns,"Summary List Placement With the end of COVID-19 nowhere near, it is hard to believe that the stock market is well into another bull run and the economy has entered into a new cycle. Mike Wilson, the chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, is among those who are optimistic about both . In a recent note, he said he expects a V-shaped economic recovery and its ripple effects on the stock market to persist so long as (1) people continue to adapt to the ""new patterns of living and consumption"" brought on by the pandemic, and (2) the Federal Reserve and government continue to provide sufficient monetary and fiscal support. Given such a macro backdrop, Wilson believes the new bull market will be driven by higher earnings based on a mix of company sales growth and operating leverage. In addition, his team was especially encouraged to see the median S&P 500 company cut their cost of goods sold as well as selling, general, and administrative expenses by 5.4% in the second quarter. He thinks this ""sets the stage for better profits next year as the economy and topline recover."" While earnings are likely to rise steadily, the combination of higher long-term rates and lower equity risk premiums (the returns investors get for taking on higher risks in the market) could bring price-to-earnings multiples lower, making valuations a headwind for earnings growth, the strategist warned.",TDG,en,Business Insider
