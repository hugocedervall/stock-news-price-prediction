Due to unusually high demand and supply shortage, many Mason jars are out of stock at major retailers. We continue to monitor inventory and update this guide accordingly. Mason jars are one of those simple items that are wonderful to have but easy to take for granted. Named after American inventor John Landis Mason, Mason jars are distinguished by their airtight screw-top lids (usually with a two-piece design), glass construction, and old-fashioned American aesthetic that hasn't changed much since they were first patented in the 19th century. Glass Mason jars are typically used for preserving perishable food products, and they are handy for many other things as well . Canning homemade goodies including jam, storing dry food items such as herbs and spices, and serving as airtight containers for keeping things like coffee or pipe tobacco fresh (two of my personal favorite uses).",BLL,en,Business Insider

The PPAs will help push the company significantly closer to its goal of fully transitioning its European operations to clean energy, it said.

Perhaps this is why, as Tom Ball of The Times UK reports , the demand for new coat of arms designs has skyrocketed in the past few years.

2020-06-03 10:17:00-05:00,Why Self-Driving Cars Might Make Traffic Worse,"Self-driving cars have the potential to revolutionze the flow of people and goods. Car crashes could become much rarer, and trips made more efficient. For those who drive to work, daily commutes could become far more productive and fun. But for society, autonomous vehicles may come with significant downsides. As automotive players ranging from BMW to Uber look to develop self-driving cars and services, some studies have shown that they could make traffic jams worse. In one example, researchers in 2018 tried to mimic the way car owners would use self-driving cars by giving subjects in the San Francisco Bay area a free chauffeur-driven vehicle for a week. The results were hardly encouraging: The arrangement resulted in increases in vehicle-miles traveled and the number of trips, particularly in the evening hours. And a substantial portion of the trips were made on a 'zero-occupancy' basis, with no rider in the car. Lead author Mustapha Harb, of the University of California at Berkeley, told GTM that having a privately owned autonomous vehicle might not only encourage people to take the car for trips they would not have bothered with before, but could also lead to the rise of so-called ghost trips. “A bike or walking trip to the store to pick up a chocolate bar will not be as attractive as the convenient option of sending an empty car to do the pick-up,” Harb theorized. “We have been working hard on increasing the number of people in cars and encouraging pooling,” he said. “With autonomous vehicles we will actually have cars with zero people on the roads.",BLL,en,Green Technology (Feed)

2019-12-17 12:47:16-05:00,A fund manager who beat 97% of his peers this year explains how he crushed the market without owning any of Wall Street's favorite tech stocks,"Fund manager Chip Reed had an extremely strong year without including any of the market-favorite FAANG stocks in his Eaton Vance Capital Select Equity fund. Reed says that by betting on companies with strong long-term earnings and good financial standing, he's created a portfolio that is defensive but still brought in powerful returns. While some investors succeeded by playing defense this year, Reed succeeded in limiting downside without buying traditionally safe stocks like utilities. Click here for more BI Prime stories. At the end of a dramatic but very strong year for the market, it's fairly clear what worked best: playing extreme offense with high-growth stocks, and playing extreme defense with high-yield stocks. But Chip Reed — lead manager of the Eaton Vance Atlanta Capital Select Equity Fund — has pulled off the feat of beating the market this year without making some of its most popular bets. The fund is up 37.4% in 2019, putting it in the 97th percentile versus peers, and well ahead of the S&P 500 .",BLL,en,Business Insider
2019-12-16 08:05:00-05:00,We interviewed Wall Street's 7 top-performing investors to get their secrets for success — and their best ideas for 2020,"Business Insider spoke with the seven best-performing large-cap fund managers of the year, based on a trailing one-year basis through the end of September. The fund managers outlined which thematic and single-stock strategies paid off for them this year, and they laid out their top trades and ideas for 2020. If you followed only financial-news headlines in 2019, you might assume the market had a tough year. Recession fears flared, trade-war tensions ebbed and flowed with ferocity, and corporate earnings growth slowed. Yet the benchmark S&P 500 was still up 19% year-to-date through the end of September. Thank the Federal Reserve and its overt willingness to continuing stimulating an economic expansion that's already the longest in history. But even amid a robust market environment that saw every major stock index climb for the year, a handful of fund managers stood out as the cream of the crop. These were the people and firms that were still able to outperform, even though equities and other risk assets were so strong across the board.",BLL,en,Business Insider

2019-11-01 14:57:51-05:00,Bad call on plastics at Denver Nuggets’ home opener,"The Phoenix Suns one-point overtime loss (108-107) to the Denver Nuggets in the Oct. 25 Nuggets’ home opener wasn’t the only disappointment I felt. My other frustration came from finding out that the Pepsi Center in Denver has kicked plastic drink cups to the curb in favor of aluminum cups. Ball Corp. (Denver) and Kroenke Sports & Entertainment (KSE) LLC debuted Ball’s “infinitely recyclable aluminum cup” at the Nuggets/Suns game. A public relations announcement from the NBA said that the change from plastic drink cups to aluminum was made “in response to growing consumer preference for more-sustainable products.” Rocky, the Denver Nuggets' mascot, holds Ball Corp.'s ""infinitely recyclable aluminum cup.” Actually, I doubt that consumers begged for aluminum drinking cups. I can just imagine holding on to an ice-filled drink in an aluminum cup for 30 minutes. Gloves might be needed to prevent frost bite. Additionally, if consumers really knew the science and production methods for aluminum, they might not be so thrilled to exchange plastic cups for the alternative.",BLL,en,PlasticsToday
