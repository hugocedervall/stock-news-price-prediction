Since 2017, it has taken effect in over 18 APAC jurisdictions, including Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore.

It is expected the nation will fully commence CRS by 1 January 2022 to carry out its first AEOI scheduled for 2023. Thai financial institutions are in the process of understanding the implications of CRS on their IT infrastructure and operating procedures as well as developing best practices to gather, verify and monitor client information for ongoing analysis and reporting purposes.
