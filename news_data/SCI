The rupiah fell 0.5% and was set for its fifth-consecutive drop. Data showed Indonesia's inflation rate slowed further in June to 1.96%, just below the central bank's target range of 2% to 4%, fuelling expectations of more easing. ""Weak price pressures support the case for a further rate cut by Bank Indonesia in the third quarter, but the timing will also be dependent on rupiah stability,"" analysts at ANZ Research wrote.
