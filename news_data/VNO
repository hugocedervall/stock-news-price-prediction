Vornado co-owns an office tower in San Francisco and another in Manhattan and ""couldn't attract a buyer"" at the price it was seeking, according to an exclusive by The Wall Street Journal . It had hoped to raise $5 billion from the deleveraging in total, of which $1.5 billion would have made its way to The Trump Organization. Vornado Chief Executive Steven Roth had said this month there was ""active interest from investors"" for the deals . It looks as though the ""active interest"" may not have been at the right price, however. The news comes as no surprise since both San Francisco and New York have been disproportionately clobbered due to the pandemic.",VNO,en,Zero Hedge

2020-10-16 23:39:37-05:00,The challenges of being $421 million in debt,"By Russ Buettner and Susanne CraigPresident Donald Trump painted a rosy picture of his financial condition during a televised town hall Thursday night, calling his hundreds of millions of dollars in debt coming due “a peanut” and saying he had borrowed it as a favor to lenders eager to take advantage of his financial strength.In fact, the loans, and the unusual requirement he had to accept to receive them, illustrate the financial challenges he faces and the long-standing reluctance of banks to deal with him.Trump had to personally guarantee $421 million in debt, a rare step that lenders only require of businesses that may not be able to repay. The commitment puts his assets on the line and could place his lenders, should he be reelected, in the position of deciding whether to foreclose on a sitting president.The personal guarantee also speaks to why, despite Trump’s assertion that banks are eager to lend him money, nearly all the money he borrowed in the last decade came from only two institutions.“When a bank asks for a personal guarantee, it is because the bank isn’t satisfied with the creditworthiness of the borrower,” said Richard Scott Carnell, who served as assistant secretary for financial institutions at the Treasury Department under President Bill Clinton and now teaches law at Fordham University. “If the captain gives a personal guarantee for the ship, he will be less likely to sink it.”Trump was asked about the debt in response to an investigation by The New York Times published last month based on a review of more than two decades of his tax-return data.",VNO,en,Economic Times India
