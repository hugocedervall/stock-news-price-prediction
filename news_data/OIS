2020-10-07 10:10:00-05:00,Morgan Stanley expects more mega-mergers in the oil industry. Here are the 11 deals the bank says are most likely.,"Summary List Placement Hammered by a collapse in oil prices, the energy industry is entering a new phase focused on returns, which is likely to bring a wave of consolidation, analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note Wednesday. Deals could help US oil companies Exxon and Chevron diversify and build out their clean-energy assets, they said. ""European peers have begun to reposition portfolios away from oil & gas production,"" the analysts said in the note. ""Majors in the US have been slower to adapt despite sharing similar advantages of scale. Focusing on M&A in the power sector, companies with renewable development capabilities could be particularly attractive alternatives to oil & gas."" Today, the energy industry remains fragmented, the analysts said, resulting in a recent spike in deals. Most notably, Chevron acquired Noble Energy in early October through a $5 billion all-stock deal, while shale giants Devon Energy and WPX Energy announced plans to merge in late September.

""We expect that to continue."" The bank says future deals are most likely between companies focused on oil production, and among the largest integrated oil majors and smaller energy producers.",OIS,en,Business Insider

2019-12-20 07:31:28-05:00,Apple’s next camera innovation for the iPhone 12 supposedly leaked,"Two things are always certain about the next iPhone version, as soon as Apple’s iPhone press conference ends in September. The model that will launch next year will have a much faster processor and an upgraded camera experience. You don’t need any leaks for that, it’s just the way Apple moves, and the entire industry with it. The iPhone 11 packs a processor that has no rival in the business, and a camera system that’s among the best mobile cameras out there. The iPhone 12, meanwhile, is expected to feature a faster A14 CPU as well as several camera improvements. But as we get closer to the next iPhone’s launch, we start seeing more and more reports about it. And now we have the first details about the iPhone 12’s cameras. According to Digitimes ( via 9to5Mac ), the 5G iPhones that Apple will release in 2020 will feature sensor-shift stabilization technology. Digitimes has a long track record reporting Apple rumors, but its predictions didn’t always come true. The sensor sensor-shift image stabilization is an interesting tidbit nonetheless.",OIS,en,BGR.com
