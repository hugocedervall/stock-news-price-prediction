The coronavirus pandemic has been a watershed moment for telehealth — or the use of mobile technology to deliver health-related services, such as remote doctor consultations and patient monitoring — as patients have had to reimagine the ways they seek healthcare. While telehealth has been on the brink of taking off for years, consumer usage of the tech ticked up slowly before 2020. The coronavirus pandemic has given consumers the push they need to adopt telemedicine on a wide scale — and we expect adoption to keep climbing so long as the pandemic rages on. Once outbreaks became severe in the US, consumers began flocking to telehealth: Telehealth usage among US adults climbed 6 percentage points month-over-month from February 2020 — when 11% of respondents reported having tried telehealth — to March — when 17% said the same, per a survey by CivicScience.","TDOC,BOE",en,Business Insider

DTx companies have been capturing the attention of pharma companies and payers this year: Pharma cos have been strategically pouring cash into DTx firms to capture a slice of the growing DTx market. For example, Boehringer Ingelheim signed a $500 million contract with Click Therapeutics to develop therapies for psychiatric conditions, Bayer invested $100 million in equity stake of digital diabetes startup OneDrop, and Novartis acquired ophthalmology DTx startup Amblyotech. And with the FDA greenlighting multiple DTx treatments—like Akili's ADHD therapy and Pear's schizophrenia program—pharma companies can invest in DTx solutions with more confidence that they'll see an ROI.

2020-11-23 09:37:00-05:00,Cerner's free telehealth program could help it leapfrog Epic in the US EHR market,"Summary List Placement The electronic health record (EHR) giant launched a new telehealth platform, dubbed Video Visit, for its rural-based CommunityWorks community and critical access hospitals (CAHs) at no cost through the end of 2021. For context, CommunityWorks is a cloud-based system that allows hospitals to connect with other facilities and providers across geographies to help address the rising shortage of physicians in rural communities. Offering a telehealth platform to high-need rural communities at no charge paves the way for Cerner to bite off an even larger share of the EHR market . Cerner serves over 200 rural and CAH clients across the US—and it's hoping to expand its rural footprint via its cloud-based CommunityWorks product launched in July 2020. Rural hospital closures have been on a steady incline , and the cloud can alleviate the cost burdens of maintenance of an in-house EHR system. By offering its Video Visits program at no charge to its CommunityWorks clients, Cerner could further penetrate the rural provider market organizations—paving the way for it to potentially upsell its other products through their doors down the road: For example, its CareAware Connect cloud-based solution connects multiple devices and coordinates care, which could help care institutions solve their interoperability challenges.",TDOC,en,Business Insider
2020-11-20 08:00:00-05:00,'You cannot do everything yourself:' Amwell's CEO hints at buying a mental health startup and shares his simple 2-part criteria for potential acquisitions,"Summary List Placement For companies that help people get healthcare online, 2020 has been a good year. But investors are concerned that their success is tied to the coronavirus pandemic. One way to create staying power is acquiring companies that perform a wider array of services. For Amwell, the world's second-largest telehealth company, the strategy isn't off the table, co-CEO Ido Schoenberg said. ""You cannot do everything yourself,"" Schoenberg told Business Insider after Amwell's earnings call on November 12, when asked if he would acquire mental health startups. Schoenberg noted that in the wake of the pandemic, people are more anxious than ever. In June, anxiety and depression symptoms were about three and four times more prevalent among US adults than a year prior, respectively, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found . ""People are in great distress,"" he said. ""And I see behavioral health needs growing in the foreseeable future."" When looking at potential deals, Schoenberg explained the two criteria he's looking out for — technology and company culture — and why a big presence in the market isn't as important.",TDOC,en,Business Insider
2020-11-19 10:05:00-05:00,Talkspace mulls possible sale as consolidation heats up in the US telehealth market,"Summary List Placement New York-based telemental health provider Talkspace is considering selling its online therapy platform, according to people familiar with the matter via Bloomberg Tech. The startup is valued at approximately $1 billion—if sold to another virtual care player, it could mirror the Teladoc-Livongo megamerger, marking further consolidation of the digital health space. Talkspace's potential sale gives credence to our prediction that M&A activity will boil up as telehealth firms aim to stay competitive amid the virtual care boom—and telemental health will be a particularly active segment: The pandemic incited an unprecedented wave of telemental health use, and this demand likely won't fade as the pandemic exacerbates the mental health crisis. Sixty-two percent of consumers said they'd prefer a virtual visit for their mental health—even after it's safe to book an in-office appointment, according to Amwell data. Telemental health options give patients more versatility in accessing the mental healthcare they need, which is becoming more relevant than ever, considering the US is in the midst of a growing shortage of mental health specialists.",TDOC,en,Business Insider

Talkspace has had a busy couple of years, even before the pandemic-induced virtual therapy boom gave way to 70% growth in clients for the startup in May alone: It landed a deal with UnitedHealth's Optum that gave it access to 2 million potential customers on the heels of a $50 million funding round in June 2019, for instance. Talkspace's acquisition confirms our prediction that consolidation would be inevitable as competition heats up in the booming telemental health space: The pandemic propelled interest in virtual mental health forward—and we don't expect its popularity to wane when the coronavirus dust settles. In the first half of 2020, US digital behavioral health startups secured $588 million in funding—surpassing 2019's total of $539 million, according to Rock Health.

2020-10-31 08:04:00-05:00,Digital health companies are racing to go public as online care goes mainstream. Here are the 17 startups that are ripe for a Wall Street debut.,"Summary List Placement It's looking like the flurry of digital health initial public offerings in 2019 and 2020 was no fluke, analysts from Rock Health, a healthcare venture and advisory firm, wrote in a July report . At least nine such companies have gone public in the last 17 months, they said, including Livongo, Health Catalyst, Change Healthcare, and Peloton. Amwell, the world's second-largest telehealth company, per company data, surged in its public debut on September 17. And Hims, a company that sells medicine and doctors' visits directly to patients, is going public through a blank-check company. It's been a record year for digital health overall. Startups raised an all-time record of $8.4 billion in the last quarter, a recent CB Insights report said , as telehealth and other means of treating patients became essential during coronavirus outbreaks. The huge bundle of cash, constituting a record number of mega-rounds, fueled more deals than ever for mental health , telehealth, and AI startups in particular, the report said.",TDOC,en,Business Insider

Further, the company boasted $289 million in Q3 2020 revenue—exceeding Wall Street estimates of $282 million, per Fierce Healthcare. Teladoc's strong earnings suggest it's in a prime position to continue building out its empire—and we expect to see a flurry of M&A activity from Teladoc-Livongo in the next year. We think the value proposition of the combined Teladoc-Livongo entity plus Teladoc's sweeping Q3 success will be attractive to health systems and payers alike: Teladoc physicians can leverage Livongo's platform to gather insights about patient's chronic disease and offer coaching for management of diabetes, for instance—which could help healthcare stakeholders offset shares of the $3 trillion the US shells out annually on chronic disease treatment.",TDOC,en,Business Insider

It's also marked a degree of outpeformance versus the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index, which has risen 33% in 2020. James' track record at the $10.2 billion Chicago-based Driehaus Capital Management is so compelling that the firm — founded in 1982 by famed momentum investor Richard Driehaus — launched another fund focused on small- and mid-cap stocks for him in May this year.
