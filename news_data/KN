But things weren't always this way. Before the financial crisis, and before regulators around the world started scrutinizing banks' derivatives businesses to try and curb risk. But while Deutsche Bank has become the poster-child for post-GFC decline - as its ambitions to become a global rival to JP Morgan crumbled to dust - Societe Generale, the French banking giant that reaped massive profits during the late 1990s and 2000s via its pioneering 'structured products' business, is also presiding over the twilight of a business line that was once the bank's profit center, but has been blamed for massive losses during the coronavirus downturn this spring. Oudea As the FT reminds us , the French bank fell to a shocking loss of €326 millions ($380 million) in the first quarter after revenue in its equity trading unit (long hailed as a key strength) collapsed almost 99% to just €9 million ($10.5 million) after the bank saw ""the worst environment you can imagine"" for its structured products business, CEO Frédéric Oudéa explained.",KN,en,Zero Hedge

The alarm was raised by research groups Amazon Watch and Stand.earth, who called oil extraction in the region “a gateway to deforestation and increased agricultural and industrial activity”. The banks that were reported to have backed the oil trade were accused of double standards, as all had made public environmental commitments, such as to the 2015 Paris climate accord, the United Nations sustainable development goals, and promises to protect forests.

2020-01-14 21:40:20-05:00,Phase 1 commodity targers likely more than China can chew - analyst,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE: Commodity traders and analysts are struggling to map out how China will reach the eye-popping amounts it is committing to buy from the United States under Phase 1 of their trade deal. China has pledged to buy $50 billion more in U.S. energy supplies, and will raise U.S. agriculture purchases by some $32 billion over two years above 2017's $24 billion baseline, according to a source briefed on the deal to be signed on Wednesday. The deal also stipulates purchases of an additional $80 billion in manufactured goods. Those totals would certainly trim the roughly $300 billion annual trade gap between the countries. However, analysts who study Chinese commodity flows remain sceptical that Beijing can absorb such quantities of U.S. goods without threatening trade ties with other suppliers, hurting its own domestic producers, and making substantial changes to import standards and quotas. ""Either China massively increases imports and reduces current account surplus from the current 1.5% of GDP, or it engages in trade diversion away from current providers of goods which compete with the U.S."" said Alicia Garcia Herrero, Chief Economist Asia Pacific at Natixis in Hong Kong. ""I see this second scenario as much more likely.""

In short, assuming a similar export mix as in 2017, this would translate into an unprecedented 235% volumetric increase in 2020 US agricultural exports to China over 2019. The problem is that while US exports to China had declined sharply in 2018, other nations stepped in, in many cases with long-term bilateral contracts in place ensuring the long-term delivery of ag products from mostly Latin American substitute markets. This, as Goldman points out, means that such an increase in Chinese purchases from the US "" would likely be hugely disruptive to global agriculture markets, primarily crowding out Argentine and Brazilian supplies that have taken substantial market share since 2017 due to the trade war and much weaker currencies.
