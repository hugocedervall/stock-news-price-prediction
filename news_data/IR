2019-10-24 16:59:02-05:00,It's becoming clear that the Patriots decision to put top receiver Josh Gordon on the IR was actually a calculated move by the NFL's shrewdest franchise,"The New England Patriots moved wide receiver Josh Gordon to the Injured Reserve on Wednesday, most likely ending his time with the team. The move was puzzling as Gordon plays a position of need, and reports indicate he does not have a season-ending injury. The move may have been a calculated decision by the Patriots, as Gordon will likely hit waivers, which would prevent him from signing with another contender. It may have saved the Patriots some money, too. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . The New England Patriots on Wednesday made a puzzling move to put wide receiver Josh Gordon on the Injured Reserve (IR). The move effectively ended Gordon's time with the Patriots. NFL teams can only designate two players to return from the IR each season. The Patriots used one on rookie wide receiver N'Keal Harry, and the other is likely to go to second-year offensive tackle Isaiah Wynn. What made the move surprising, however, was that Gordon, who injured his knee in Week 6 against the New York Giants, then sat out Week 7, doesn't appear to have a season-ending injury.",IR,en,Business Insider

By the time the train reaches Panipat, it will have run past four lesser known stations — Bazida Jatan, Gharaunda, Kohand and Babarpur. The track maintainers have asked for what’s called a block in railways jargon, which means no other train will run on that stretch while the block is enforced for repair.At the control room, Dev has a quick telephonic conversation with the Panipat station master even as he takes a close look at his colour-coded dashboard showing movement of trains — freight, passenger, express — before granting a 15-minute block near Panipat.For Dev & his fellow controllers taking impromptu and sensitive decisions on train movements in 305 section controls spread across India, what has emerged as a gamechanger is the Indian Space Research Organisation’s GAGAN (GPS Aided GEO Augmented Navigation), a satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS) that was initially developed for the Indian airspace.",IR,en,The Economic Times India

The project to corporatise the production units has also been delayed as trade unions representing about 82,000 workers in the seven factories have fiercely opposed the idea of converting their workplace into a public sector undertaking (PSU). They see the move as a ploy to eventually sell the asset to a private conglomerate.ET Magazine has learnt that these two reformist ideas, despite being delayed, are well on the shortlist of six transformative projects the IR has retained from a wider list of 11.

2019-03-25 11:37:36-05:00,D.E. Shaw gives special access to its biggest investor Blackstone and it shows the power of large investors,"Sources say $50 billion quant D.E. Shaw's preferential treatment of its biggest investor, private equity giant Blackstone, leads to the fund getting special access to internal and one-off funds, as well as reduced fees. The relationship between the two is reflective of a growing industry reality that hedge funds — even industry titans like D.E. Shaw — are becoming much more responsive to, and dependent on, their biggest investors. Every hedge fund — even the biggest firms run by celebrity investors — is most concerned about one thing: Keeping its biggest investor happy. For $50 billion quant fund D.E. Shaw, that means giving its biggest investor — private equity giant Blackstone —preferential treatment, according to several sources inside the manager. Blackstone is the largest hedge fund investor in the world, with more than $78 billion invested in hedge funds as of the end of 2018, so it pulls weight across the hedge fund world. And it's unclear exactly what percentage of D.E. Shaw's assets are owned by Blackstone, since the private equity giant has invested across multiple products.",IR,en,Business Insider
