Several years ago, the San Francisco-based logistics warehousing giant embarked on what turned out to be a successful plan to drive down its warehouse lighting costs. Prologis then realized it could offer its customers LED retrofits at prices they couldn't obtain on their own. What's more, Prologis could help customers avoid the inevitable time and resource commitments to search for and vet suitable suppliers. The episode sowed the seeds of a project that became known as ""Essentials,"" which after a decent amount of spade work launched in mid-2017. Whether it be forklifts, conveyors, robotics, janitorial services or soft drink machines, the mission behind Essentials is the same: to rely on Prologis' supplier connections and enormous scale to help customers facilitate the inside-the-warehouse procurement process and buy or lease goods or services at more favorable rates through their relationships with the developer.",PLD,en,Benzinga
