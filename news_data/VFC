2019-05-05 12:40:03-05:00,Ecommerce bandwagon turns lifeboat for global brands,"NEW DELHI: Apart from taking fashion to the far corners of India, the growth of ecommerce is giving global brands struggling in the local market another shot at success. Arvind Fashion is said to be in talks with Walmart-owned Flipkart to offload the India licences for a raft of foreign brands, including Izod, Nautica, Gant and Ed Hardy, according to people familiar with the development. US-based VF Corp, owner of the Vans brand, is also said to be talking to the ecommerce company to sell its India licence, they added. “The trend is that the brands that do not find favour with the consumers through offline stores are now going through the online channels,” said Harminder Sahni, cofounder of retail consultancy Wazir Advisors. 69191097 Flipkart said questions about such talks were speculative. “We always work closely with all Indian brand owners/partners to list and grow their brands on our marketplace,” a Flipkart spokesperson said in an email. “It is deeply satisfying that brands are also seeing us as an unparalleled and unique channel for their growth and also to strength positioning in India.” The Flipkart group controls about 65% of the online fashion business in India along with its Myntra and Jabong portals. “Online is an effective and low-cost kind of a channel as there are no fixed costs attached to the brands themselves,” Sahni said. “Flipkart want the rights to manufacture Vans products to be sold in India,” said one of the persons cited above.",VFC,en,The Economic Times India
