2020-08-28 18:40:00-05:00,Bill Gates Next Project: Building Nuclear Power Plants Across The Pacific Northwest,"Bill Gates Next Project: Building Nuclear Power Plants Across The Pacific Northwest Tyler Durden Fri, 08/28/2020 - 19:40 Here comes the next Bill Gates project which, like his others, aims to solve climate change and save the planet. However, this time, some of the critics of Gates & Co.'s approach have warned that the advanced nuclear power plants he's now trying to build (which would ""supplement"" the northwest's power grid) might be vulnerable to terror attacks due to high levels of enriched uranium. In a report published Thursday, Reuters revealed, for the first time, a new campaign by the Gates-controlled TerraPower LLC (Gates is chairman of the company's board) to build commercial advanced nuclear energy plants called ""Natrium"" in the US later in the decade. The project will focus on the Pacific Northwest, where Gates has won the backing of three major utilities in the region, including Berkshire Hathaway-owned PacifiCorp (of course Gates' best buddy Warren Buffett was more than willing to help out, we imagine).",SE,en,Zero Hedge

Numerous unnecessary employees at Twitter allegedly have the ability to reset users’ accounts and modify their security settings. This is a problem that Jack Dorsey, chief executive officer, and the company’s board were warned about all the way back in 2015. According to Bloomberg , Twitter has over 1,500 workers with the abilities to reset accounts and review user breaches. This led to speculation that the hack on July 15 could have been prevented if timelier actions were taken. Security concerns addressed The report clarified that such credentials gave limited access to most of the workers involved in the social network’s security department. They do note however that it is “a starting point to snoop on or even hack an account.” The “Risk Factors” section of Twitter’s 10-K annual report, filed in 2015 with the Securities Exchange Commission, or SEC, confirms that Dorsey & Co. had long been warned of this potential attack vector: “Our security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise.",SE,en,Cointelegraph
