2020-12-07 12:40:46-05:00,A foreclosure wave looms in 2021 because millions of Americans have stopped paying their mortgages,"Summary List Placement The housing market has been described as a bright spot throughout the pandemic — but there's a dark side. For some borrowers, the market is singing a somber tune as the calendar approaches 2021. The trouble has to do with delinquencies — the term for when a mortgage borrower is over 30 days late on their payment. In a usual year, a delinquency soon leads to a foreclosure, as the bank that provided the mortgage seizes the property. The word ""foreclosure"" evokes the aftermath of the Great Recession, when the subprime-mortgage crisis triggered a wave of foreclosures and threw millions out of their homes. But 2020 isn't a usual year. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which took effect in March, protects borrowers with federally backed mortgages by offering 180 days of mortgage relief that can be extended to an additional 180 days, according to the Conference of State Bank Supervisors , a national regulatory organization. This provision has kept foreclosures low, but delinquencies are starting to get high.",CLGX,en,Business Insider

Gold and silver were also getting shellacked. But it wasn’t all crash and burn. First Solar, Rolls-Royce Holdings, and CoreLogic all notched double digit gains.
