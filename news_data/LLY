The leading vaccine-makers are now aiming to produce hundreds of millions of doses of their shots. The global demand for a COVID-19 vaccine is likely to vastly outstrip supply, turning more attention to the ability of companies to pump out doses. The manufacturing challenge may be most dramatic for Moderna, a biotech upstart that has never before produced or sold a commercial medicine. Its flagship manufacturing facility in Norwood, Massachusetts, has never been inspected by the US Food and Drug Administration, yet will be depended upon to deliver millions of doses of the company's coronavirus vaccine candidate. Adding to the challenge, the leading vaccines from both Moderna and Pfizer are based on a new technology called messenger RNA, which has never before been used for a federally approved vaccine or treatment.

Llamas and other camelids might help scientists develop powerful coronavirus drugs that could treat COVID-19 patients. The first such tests were performed early in the pandemic, with researchers looking at llama antibodies for creating monoclonal antibody drugs that would work inside human hosts. These are similar to human antibodies that the immune system produces upon infection with a pathogen like SARS-CoV-2.

US regulators approved the virus-fighting drug remdesivir on Thursday, greenlighting its use in hospitalized patients. The US Food and Drug Administration had given an emergency OK for the drug's use in May. But it's unclear how well remdesivir, marketed as Veklury, works for patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Studies respectively led by the US National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization came to conflicting conclusions, with the WHO research casting doubt on the drug's benefits. ""It has an effect, but it doesn't really have an amazing effect that people were hoping it would have,"" Dr. Walid Gellad, director for the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing at the University of Pittsburgh, told Business Insider in a Friday phone interview. In squaring the findings of the main studies on remdesivir, longtime drug discovery researcher Derek Lowe wrote that ""for remdesivir, it looks like the argument now is 'Does it help a bit or just not at all?'"" Despite that uncertainty, one thing is clear: Remdesivir's manufacturer, the California biotech giant Gilead Sciences, is in a prime position to sell billions of dollars worth of the drug.",LLY,en,Business Insider

The FDA first granted the drug emergency authorization in May, allowing hospitals and doctors to use the drug even though by all accounts it wasn't that widely used.

Three months later, in September, JPM chimed in with a counter-narrative that a contested election was the ""worst case scenario for the market into year end."" All of this culminated last week when in a rapidly-cobbled together consensus, Wall Street concluded that not only is a contested election unlikely but that a Democratic Sweep - and thus higher corporate taxes - is actually good for stocks. And then, just to assure investors that no matter what happens - even a massive increase in the top long-term capital gains tax from 20% to 39.6% under the Biden admin - they shouldn't sell, JPMorgan came out with a late Friday report according to which while a spike in cap gains taxes could be negative for market in late 2021, it would have little to no impact over the long-run.",LLY,en,Zero Hedge

Or do you happen to have friend or family member who has been diagnosed with diabetes? If so, you know how critical it is to have access to the wonder drug insulin. Because access to insulin can literally mean the difference between life and death, the Illinois State Legislature recently mandated a cap on the cost of insulin at $100 per 30-day supply. The Governor signed it into law and now Illinois residents are protected from price gouging on this critical medication. You would think that every single state legislator would have voted yes on this bill. And you would almost be right. It passed with strong support from both Democrats and Republicans. Our local Republican State Rep. Tom Demmer, voted no and our local Republican State Sen. Brian Stewart did not vote at all on this issue. Wonder why? Check out who donates to their campaigns.

The death rate from COVID-19 has been on the rise in the US once again for nearly a month following a steady decline after the initial spike in April. Gates also notes that we won't be able to get back to normal until a vaccine is ready. As bad as the second spike of the coronavirus pandemic has been in the United States, the silver lining was that the death rate had continued to drop even as our daily confirmed case count skyrocketed. Unfortunately, that trend ended in July, as the death toll began slowly creeping back up, and as of July 27th, the US was averaging over 1,000 deaths a day. This is the first time the seven-day average has been over 1,000 deaths since late May, but as awful as the US response to the pandemic has been, Bill Gates believes we will soon be able to control the death rate. In an interview with CNBC's Squawk Box this Monday , billionaire philanthropist and Microsoft's co-founder Bill Gates said that we will have therapeutic drugs to more effectively treat COVID-19 before the end of the year, but added that we won't be able to return to our normal lives until a safe and effective vaccine is readily available. ‚ÄúYou can see the therapeutic benefit faster than the protective benefit,‚Äù Gates said. ‚ÄúSo I think there‚Äôs a good chance we‚Äôll have substantial death-rate reduction by the end of the year with the combination of those new tools.‚Äù During the interview, Gates mentioned remdesivir , which was one of the first treatments to show efficacy among those who had been infected with the novel coronavirus.",LLY,en,BGR

Some people are dying because they can't afford the life-saving drug. In the last decade, the list prices of common types of insulin have roughly tripled, even though they're the exact same products offered 10 years ago. In 2009, the list price for a 10-milliliter vial of Humalog, a fast-acting insulin made by Eli Lilly, was about $93. Today it costs closer to $275. Similarly, Novo Nordisk's fast-acting insulin Novolog cost almost $93 for a 10-milliliter vial in 2009. Today, it costs about $290. The prices of Humalog and Novolog have essentially increased in lockstep . We've seen similar price hikes for Lantus, a common long-acting insulin made by Sanofi, and long-acting Levemir, also made by Novo Nordisk.

Now, though, they're involved in a bitter fight. Amgen is trying to get out of the collaboration, while Novartis is now suing Amgen to keep it in place. Aimovig costs roughly $7,000 a year and was the first of a new category of migraine drugs to get to market. The lawsuit provides a window into how successful it has been, and how much Novartis stands to lose in the disagreement. Years ago, two big drugmakers partnered to bring a new kind of cutting-edge migraine medication to patients. The collaboration was wildly successful. Maybe too successful. One of the collaborators, the $120 billion drug company Amgen , is now trying to get out of the agreement with the $220 billion Swiss drug giant Novartis . But Novartis isn't taking it lying down. The drug giant just sued Amgen, arguing that its partner doesn't have a legitimate reason to end the collaboration.

Thus, proper due diligence is critical, and that includes tapping the experts for information about these often difficult-to-gauge stocks.

2019-02-04 09:21:34-05:00,Key Events This Week: All Eyes On State Of The Disunion,"After last week's furious newflow and peak earnings calendar, there is a palpable sense of exhaustion as we head into the new week, which coupled with China's Lunar New Year, assures a much more subdued trading environment, as seen already by the listless moves in US equity futures. Meanwhile, coming off the back of a record breaking run for markets in January, there isn't a huge number of hurdles for markets to jump this week, when President Trump's delayed State of the (Dis)Union address, another slew of corporate earnings releases and the BoE meeting will the highlights. That said, there is still a sizeable backlog of top-tier economic data to work through which may or may not be released next week. In addition, we get the final global PMIs while Brexit and US-China trade headlines are unlikely to stray too far from the spotlight. As summarized by Michael Every, here are the abridged highlights of the coming week: Today we get US factory orders and durable goods; Tuesday it‚Äôs Aussie trade and retail sales, then the RBA meeting, and then the Fed‚Äôs Mester on the economy, Eurozone services PMIs, and the US services ISM.",LLY,en,Zero Hedge
