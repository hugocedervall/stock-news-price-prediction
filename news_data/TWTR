The company is following in the footsteps of YouTube and Facebook by committing to audits by the Media Rating Council to assess its brand safety controls and measurement metrics. An MRC accreditation is seen as a key industry stamp of approval that indicates a platform or publishers' internal systems are working effectively and without bias. Twitter said it also plans to announce a number of new third-party brand safety partnerships in the coming weeks. Like other social platforms, Twitter has to balance letting users freely publish content with the needs of advertisers who don't want their ads to appear near trolling, misinformation, pornographic or otherwise harmful material. ""We want every brand to feel confident advertising on Twitter,"" said Sarah Personette, Twitter VP of global client solutions, in an interview. ""Brand safety is a critical component to that."" Tackling brand safety is time-consuming for social media companies, considering each individual's news feed looks different to one another's.","TWTR,PG",en,Business Insider

The industry assumption is that most users will opt out from being tracked — which will prevent mobile advertisers, developers, adtech companies from accessing Apple's Identifier for Advertisers (known as the IDFA) in order to target users with ads and measure the effectiveness of those campaigns. Analysts from Arete Research estimated the change could wipe out $40 billion in mobile app ad spending, affecting companies ranging from tech giants including Facebook, Snap and Twitter to game developers and publishers.

(AP Photo/Ben Gray) Many allegations advanced by the president, his surrogates and supporters have been challenged and some have been dismissed by courts or debunked. Still, in numerous instances, media fact checkers have not been diligent. They have simply run the allegations past state authorities and other officials who would have orchestrated the alleged fraud or had an interest in minimizing irregularities.

However, it turns out the new-look, Reddit-style replies were actually more confusing for users of the typical conversation interface, and the company has decided to roll back the changes. Those who trialed the new layout for replies saw lines and indentations that were supposed to make it clearer who is talking to whom and to fit more of the conversation in one view. Twitter also put engagement actions such as Like, Retweet, and Reply icons behind an extra tap in an effort to make replies to conversations easier to follow. The features were first trialed in the experimental twttr beta app and then added to the regular app a few months later.

Fleets have no retweets, likes, or public comments, do not show up in search or moments, and cannot be embedded on external websites. Prior to today's launch, the fleets feature was in testing in countries that include Brazil, India, South Korea, and Italy. Twitter says that it hopes the addition of ephemeral tweets will help people feel more comfortable sharing casual thoughts and opinions without the pressure of gaining retweets and likes. In countries where fleets were tested, Twitter says that people talked more on Twitter and were more open to sharing what was on their minds. That thing you didn’t Tweet but wanted to but didn’t but got so close but then were like nah. We have a place for that now—Fleets! Rolling out to everyone starting today. pic.twitter.com/auQAHXZMfH — Twitter (@Twitter) November 17, 2020 Fleets can include photos or videos and can be customized with different background and text options.",TWTR,en,Mac Rumors

This partisan split was on full display this week at the Senate Commerce Committee's hearing to discuss the landmark piece of internet legislation with the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter, and Google. The hearing was called in response to decisions taken by Twitter and Facebook to limit the distribution of a New York Post story detailing correspondence between Hunter Biden and an advisor to Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company: Twitter blocked users outright from sharing the story, while Facebook tweaked its algorithm to limit its distribution. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas asked Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey: ""Who the hell elected you and put you in charge of what the media are allowed to report?"" Meanwhile, Democrat Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii admonished Dorsey to not ""let the specter of removing Section 230 protections or an amendment to antitrust law or any other kinds of threats cause you to be a party to the subversion of our democracy."" So what's Section 230, and how will the upcoming election impact its application?",TWTR,en,Business Insider

It is difficult to believe that this is actually happening, and it is yet more evidence of how badly our system has deteriorated. Of course President Trump may decide to declare victory anyway if he has a significant lead on election night, but any such declaration will immediately be branded “illegitimate” by the mainstream media , the big tech companies and everyone else on the left. For months, pundits on the left have been trying to convince us that President Trump may have a lead initially but that Joe Biden will surely be victorious once all of the mail-in ballots are finally counted.

Most U.S. adults on Twitter post only rarely. But a small share of highly active users, most of whom are Democrats, produce the vast majority of tweets . The Center’s analysis finds that just 10% of users produced 92% of all tweets from U.S. adults since last November, and that 69% of these highly prolific users identify as Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents . - Pew Research Several factors contribute to this phenomenon, says Pew , including that more Democrats use Twitter than Republicans , and the 10% most active Democrats produce roughly twice as many tweets per month (157) than the 10% of most active Republicans (79). [If it were the other way around, Russian bots would surely be to blame.] Those who use Twitter on both sides of the aisle tend to be younger and more highly educated than those who don't use the platform - with some 37% of adult Democrats on Twitter falling between the ages of 18 and 29, compared to just 22% of Republican users in the same age bracket.",TWTR,en,Zero Hedge

While esports may have once stood for a subset of sports culture, it has grown into a full industry in its own right.

The uproar with the grisly attack stems from social media platforms not censoring or banning hate videos calling for people in the Muslim community to take action against Paty for disrespecting Islam , according to FT . Paty was beheaded last week by an 18-year-old Chechen refugee, triggered by Islamic extremism on social media that outlined how the teacher showed his class a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed as part of a lesson on freedom of speech. French authorities allege social media platforms accelerated Paty's killing by allowing a couple of videos filled with hate to circulate the internet with limited censorship.

Well, that’s that then. Yesterday, the New York Post revealed details of emails recovered from Hunter Biden’s laptop that showed Biden had introduced his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, to a top executive in a Ukrainian energy firm a year before Biden pressured the government of Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who was investigating the company. The story went viral despite the best efforts of both Twitter and Facebook to censor it by blocking links to the article and locking the accounts of anyone who shared it. “However, according to The Washington Post, then-Vice President Biden played no role in pressuring Ukraine officials into firing the prosecutor, who also was not investigating the energy firm,” states a Twitter summary of the Post’s investigation. “It also doesn’t detail whether the elder Biden actually met with Hunter’s Ukrainian business associate.” Late last month, the Washington Post editorial board announced the least shocking news ever, that the newspaper was officially endorsing Joe Biden for president, asserting that he “would restore decency, honor and competence to America’s government.” So in other words, a Democratic Party establishment mouthpiece that has a long history of supporting Democratic presidential candidates and recently threw its weight behind Joe Biden’s presidential campaign, has concluded that Joe Biden did nothing wrong.",TWTR,en,Zero Hedge

Uber, Slack and Airbnb soon jumped on the bandwagon. In the past week, Microsoft, Target, Ford Motor Co. and The New York Times said they, too, had postponed the return of in-person work to next summer and acknowledged the inevitable: The pandemic isn’t going away anytime soon.“Let’s just bite the bullet,” said Joan Burke, the chief people officer of DocuSign in San Francisco.",TWTR,en,Economic Times India

Filed by the WeChat Users Alliance and several other plaintiffs in the U.S. District Court in San Francisco, the lawsuit claims the executive order to ban WeChat is unconstitutional and violates the right to free speech.

Altucher said that despite offices in midtown being allowed to be open, they’re still largely empty because companies like Citigroup, JP Morgan, Google, Twitter and Facebook are encouraging their employees to work remotely from home “for years or maybe permanently.” “This completely damages not only the economic eco-system of New York City…but what happens to your tax base when all of your workers can now live anywhere they want to in the country? ” asked the entrepreneur, noting that many were fleeing to places that are cheaper to live like Nashville, Austin, Miami and Denver.",TWTR,en,Zero Hedge

These types of docks were more commonly seen on speakers at the time, such as Apple's iPod Hi-Fi that was released in 2006.

The report explains that it is not immediately obvious why Twitter is interested in purchasing TikTok, given the cost of acquisition and the need for substantial restructuring. Twitter's comparatively small size would, however, likely please antitrust investigators. Twitter has a market capitalization of around $30 billion, which is almost as much as the valuation of TikTok's available assets, and would need to raise substantial additional capital. Twitter is therefore thought to be unable to finance a large enough bid to displace Microsoft as the front-runner, particularly before the deadline to complete a sale set out by President Trump. Private equity company Silver Lake, a major Twitter shareholder, is said to be interested in helping to fund a deal. Twitter declined to comment to The Wall Street Journal .

Things have been changing every few days. “There is an opportunity to capitalise on the short-video-sharing market but for creating a better product than TikTok instead of a TikTok clone,” said Rutvik Doshi, managing director at Inventus Capital Partners. “Money will continue to flow into this space as some investors would want to take a bet depending on their risk capital. But some, like me, would not jump into an opportunity yet as the full picture is still not clear.” “Smaller companies may find it hard to raise money, however, larger entertainment platforms which have expanded into this space have seen major growth and cementing of advantage..,” said Karan Bedi, CEO of video-streaming platform MX Player, which launched a short-video app MX TakaTak recently.",TWTR,en,Economic Times India

Turkey's parliament on Wednesday passed a law that gives authorities more powers to control content on social media . Among other things, the law requires social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter to have representatives in Turkey who are tasked with dealing with complaints about content on their platforms. Failure to designate a representative will be punished with large fines, advertising bans and bandwidth reductions that would make the use of a social media network so slow as to be impractical. Penalties will also be imposed if content that has been found unacceptable is not removed or blocked within 24 hours. The new legislation will also require user data from social media networks to be stored in Turkey.

However, ad revenue dropped 23% on the quarter, highlighting that Twitter is not immune to the pressures weighing on other social media platforms as well.

Too Much Uncertainty: Canaccord Genuity analyst Maria Ripps said there are simply too many near-term uncertainties for Twitter shares to have much upside at its current valuation. “While user momentum is likely to persist, the company's higher exposure to more impacted brand advertising and limited visibility over the near term likely caps upside to estimates, and any potential upside from the subscription opportunity is still uncertain,” Ripps wrote in a note.",TWTR,en,Benzinga Feeds

Insider Intelligence analyzes this industry and several others to provide in-depth analyst reports, proprietary forecasts, customizable charts, and more. Learn more about what we offer. Despite accelerated user engagement growth, Twitter missed Wall Street expectations for ad revenues. It reported on Thursday that worldwide ad revenues fell by 23% to $562 million, while the number of monetizable daily active users (mDAUs) rose by 34% to 186 million. Here are the most important things marketers should know: User engagement growth accelerated. For the second consecutive quarter, Twitter posted its highest year-over-year mDAU growth rate since it began reporting the metric in Q4 2018. The continued growth is likely a result of consumer demand for news, though it will be more difficult for it to maintain the same momentum as shelter-in-place measures are lifted. Note that Twitter's mDAU figures are not directly comparable with daily active user (DAU) figures from other social platforms, including Snapchat, which added fewer-than-expected DAUs in Q2.",TWTR,en,Business Insider

The hacking came to light in February this year but at that time, the details involved 10.6 million users -- celebrities, tech CEOs and employees, reporters and government officials -- who stayed at the MGM properties in the casino capital in the US in 2019. According to a ZDNet report, the new finding came to light after a hacker put up for sale the hotel's data in an ad published on a dark web cybercrime marketplace. ""According to the ad, the hacker is selling the details of 142,479,937 MGM hotel guests for a price just over $2,900,"" said the report. The hacker obtained the data after breaking into DataViper, a data leak monitoring service operated by Night Lion Security.

If every iPhone 12 model includes a USB-C to Lightning cable, it will be the first time that every new model has had a USB-C cable in the box, as the iPhone 11 shipped with a USB-A cable. Rumors also suggest that Apple will forgo a charger this generation, and only include a cable. iPhone 12 rumors have been floating around the internet for months, but the one that has picked up the most traction in recent weeks has nothing to do with the specifications or features of the phone itself. Instead, analysts and leakers are now convinced that the iPhone 12 will not ship with a charging brick or wired headphones. Apple could make the packaging for the iPhone smaller and produce less e-waste than it normally does. Of course, first-time iPhone owners will still need some way to charge their new phones, which is why the inclusion of a charging cord is inevitable.

Some Twitter users touted it as proof that a conservative push to buy Goya products had succeeded over a liberal-led boycott of the brand after its CEO made comments in support of President Trump. However, item limits have been commonplace at grocery stores, especially in canned goods aisles, since the beginning of the pandemic. Canned goods, especially beans, have seen unprecedented demand, and grocery stores have been having a hard time keeping them in stock. There's also a nationwide shortage of beans — US production of dry beans dropped by 16% last year, according to the USDA. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . Grocery canned goods aisles have become an unexpected political battleground after Goya CEO Robert Unanue praised President Trump last Thursday, sparking both backlash and support .

An Amicus Curiae -- a friend of the court in legal parlance -- gives independent opinion on a case that involves complex issues.“If these students are barred from studying in the U.S. until the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic ends, many of them will not return, they will switch to programs of study elsewhere in the world,” it said.In all, 19 companies and local unions, like the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, the Software Alliance and the Information Technology Industry Council, have signed the brief in a case where Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and 180 other colleges have filed, opposing the July 6 directive by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).",TWTR,en,Economic Times India

As we all know, the answer is Big Tech platforms: Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Twitter, Netflix et al.

Gold has had a great run over the past year. Gold prices have risen in every single currency on earth and in many currencies gold prices are up well over 30 percent from last summer. In early January, I published an article (in Finnish) in a local financial newspaper where I articulated why gold would rise to $1800 per ounce during the first half of the year – a rise of 20 percent in just six months. As it turns out, gold did just that on the last day of June meaning that in the end my estimation was correct. Although more volatile than expected, gold price in New York reached my target of $1800 per ounce during the first half of 2020 on the very last day . It has hit records against all other currencies.

2020-06-26 06:00:07-05:00,Twitter can reveal truth behind people and their statin use,"London, June 26 (IANS) Social media platforms like Twitter can be utilised as a data source to find beliefs and attitudes that may impact on patient's decisions regarding their statin treatment, to reduce the risk of heart attacks and stroke. According to the researchers from University of York in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania, social media feeds could lead to people changing their dosage depending on what they had or were about to eat. Researchers focused on social media as a less intrusive way to find out more about people's attitudes to statins - rather than talking directly to patients about their behaviour and reasons. The team read and analysed more than 11,000 posts from Twitter where a statin was mentioned over a period of five years. Many of the posts were identified as a statin user or as someone who knows a statin user, or a health professional. Of the over 1,000 posts analysed which focused on beliefs around medication, 72 per cent of the opinions or beliefs referred to risk compensation behaviours in which patients engage in behaviours such as poor diet and physical inactivity, perceiving themselves to be ""protected"" or at lower risk by virtue of taking preventative medications.",TWTR,en,Sify.com

Purchase this report. To check to see if you already have access to Business Insider Intelligence through your company, click here. Content moderation has become a top priority for social platforms — including Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Pinterest, and LinkedIn — amid rising public and political scrutiny and escalating content-related crises. Brands, lawmakers, and even social media execs are coming to grips with the reality that platforms are not up to the task of moderating content on their own, primarily due to their massive scale. The scale of the problem — and the difficulty of fixing it — roughly correlate with the scale of platforms themselves. Even if 99% of harmful content is removed from a large platform, an enormous amount can still remain. Even leadership at social platforms believe their platforms should have oversight from external stakeholders, with some either publicly stating that belief or privately meeting with regulators.",TWTR,en,Business Insider

The posts by the White House also presented a new challenge for Facebook and Twitter, which have struggled with how to properly moderate the president's posts. A few hours after the posts went up, they disappeared from Facebook and Twitter. It's not clear why. The White House spread an unproven conspiracy theory on social media blaming far-left groups and ""antifa"" for placing pallets of bricks at protests following the death of George Floyd to incite anti-police violence.",TWTR,en,Business Insider

Twitter analyst CryptoWhale teased a new model for Bitcoin ( BTC ) on June 2, which claims to use quantum analysis to predict future price. The Fermions Flows, or FF, Whale Model forecasts a bottom in 2021 followed by a bull-run starting in 2022. Is quantum physics related to Bitcoin? Fermions, after which the model is named, are subatomic particles which follow Fermi-Dirac statistics and generally have a half odd-integer spin. Fermi-Dirac statistics describe a distribution of particles over energy states in systems consisting of many identical particles, where none of the particles can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. It is certainly within the realms of possibility that this could be considered analogous to a system such as Bitcoin price. Bearish short to mid-term outlook CryptoWhale has spent the past six years developing the model, which they claim has “effectively predicted every major move since 2018.",TWTR,en,Cointelegraph

Trump’s order, issued on Thursday, is intended to undermine the legal protections enjoyed by social media companies including Twitter and Facebook. He asked federal regulators to look at provisions, contained in Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, that insulate the companies from liability for content posted by users.

2020-05-28 12:25:20-05:00,Legal and tech policy experts say Trump's executive order draft cracking down on social media companies is dead on arrival,"President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order seeking to crack down on social media companies after Twitter took the rare step this week of adding fact-checking labels to two of his tweets. A draft of the order obtained by Business Insider shows Trump is mainly attempting to empower federal regulators to re-interpret and amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to make it more difficult for tech companies to moderate content on their platforms. It would direct the FCC and FTC to change the way Section 230 is interpreted, regulated, and applied, and it would allow for users to complain if they think the companies are acting in a way that goes against their terms of service. Legal and tech policy experts told Business Insider that some sections of the draft executive order are not legal at all and other parts would require government agencies to throw out years of judicial interpretation of Section 230.

Part of the reaction was Twitter’s decision to stick a “fact check” label on two of Trump’s tweets about mail-in ballots. This decision, in turn sparked its own backlash around issues of freedom of expression and political bias. (Will President Stacey Abrams ever get a tweet fact-checked by Twitter? Probably not.) Overlooked in the social media scrum over Trump’s tweets, however, is the one issue most relevant to voters in New Hampshire: Donald Trump is right about mail-in ballots. Mostly. First, the tweets: Per usual with President Trump, there’s a lot he gets wrong. Is it true that California is “sending Ballots to…anyone living in the state?” No. ",TWTR,en,Zero Hedge

In an interaction with The New York Times, Nadella said that an all-remote setup would be ""replacing one dogma with another dogma"". ""What does burnout look like? What does mental health look like? What does that connectivity and the community building look like? One of the things I feel is, hey, maybe we are burning some of the social capital we built up in this phase where we are all working remote. What's the measure for that?"" Nadella was quoted as saying. His comment came after Twitter granted an option to his staff to work from home 'forever' even after the COVID-19 pandemic ends. Twitter upped the ante after Facebook, Alphabet (Google) and others have asked their employees to work from home till year-end.",TWTR,en,Sify.com

2020-05-14 10:45:46-05:00,Twitter and other companies allowing employees to work from home indefinitely will need to adopt additional technology,"Twitter told employees earlier this week that, so long as their position allows for it, they have the option to permanently shift to remote work. The company said it would let employees choose whether to return to corporate offices, which will reopen once the pandemic has diminished to a safe level. Most Twitter offices won't reopen until at least September, and even then, any reopenings would be staggered. Twitter also canceled business travel through September, along with all in-person company events through 2020. Twitter's decision adds to a trend of corporations embracing work-from-home accommodations that extend beyond the pandemic. Earlier this month, Nationwide Insurance permanently adopted a hybrid remote work policy, in which employees across five corporate offices will transition to remote work, allowing the company to shed approximately 2 million square feet of office space.

That the global economy is fragile is painfully obvious to all. What is less obvious is the bailouts intended to ""save"" the fragile economy actively increase its fragility, setting up an inevitable collapse of the entire precarious system. Systems that are highly centralized, i.e. dependent on a handful of nodes that are each points of failure--are intrinsically fragile and prone to collapse. Put another way, systems in which all the critical nodes are tightly bound are prone to domino-like cascades of failure as any one point of failure quickly disrupts every other critical node that is bound to it. Ours is an economy in which capital, wealth, power and control are concentrated in a few nodes of the network/ecosystem we call ""the economy."" A handful of corporations own the vast majority of the media, a handful of banks control most of the lending and capital, a handful of hospital chains, pharmaceutical companies and insurers control healthcare, and so on.",TWTR,en,Zero Hedge

All three telcos have strongly discouraged the sector regulator on the need to publish details of all plans, including those not on offer but active. They said publication of withdrawn offers, active only among a few users, would create confusion, leading to a surge in customer complaints.In its submissions to Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), Jio said if plans not available for subscription to new users are published alongwith all plans available, there’s “liable to be confusion for a customer, leading to unwanted complaints”. It added users “might like an unavailable plan, and complain to the Authority” if unable to subscribe to the same.The limited set of existing users availing of such plans -- not otherwise on offer to new users -- it said, are “fully aware of applicable benefits, terms and conditions”.Mirroring Jio’s views, Airtel said “display of all plans, including those not on offer,” would make “customers unhappy” and also impact “quality of services at telco call-centres” if awash with queries about plans no longer available for subscription.Vodafone Idea backed their views, saying publishing details of “many withdrawn plans” would end up “consuming a lot of space, cost, and cause unnecessary confusion for consumers”.Less than three years ago, the older carriers had sparred with Jio on the matter of transparency of tariff plans, with the incumbents saying that some offers, especially counter-offers to retain users, had to be kept confidential to protect competitive advantage.",TWTR,en,The Economic Times India

Specifically, the ""deflation"" assets, such as bonds, credit, growth stocks (315%), have massively outperformed inflation assets, e.g., commodities, cash, banks, value stocks (249%) since QE1. At the same time, US equities (269%) have massively outperformed non-US equities (106%) since launch of QE1."" And, as happens every time the Fed tries to manage asset prices, it had blown another bubble: commenting on the hyperinflation in risk assets, Hartnett said that the ""lowest interest rates in 5,000 years have guaranteed a melt-up trade in risk assets"", which the strategist had called the Icarus Trade since late 2015, noting that the latest, ""e-Commerce"" bubble, which consists of AMZN, NFLX, GOOG, TWTR, EBAY, FB, is up 617% since the financial crisis, making it the 3rd largest bubble of the past 40 years."" Fast forward two years, one failed attempt at normalizing interest rates, one QE4, and one historic P/E multiple expansion meltup later, when the same bull market leadership in ""growth"" assets has led to the unprecedented result that the top 5 stocks now account for a greater share of S&P500 market cap than ever before … ... and when what in 2018 was the third largest bubble of all time only has - thanks to 800 rate cuts by central banks since the Lehman bankruptcy - now been rebranded to "" e-Commerce"" by BofA's Hartnett, and which as shown in the chart below has - after rising more than 1,000% from its crisis lows - become the single biggest asset bubble of all time .",TWTR,en,Zero Hedge

But it still has a future—in AR,"When The New York Times’s Kashmir Hill exposed a startup called Clearview AI in an article titled “The Secretive Company That Might End Privacy as We Know It,” the main reaction was one of future shock. Clearview had built an enormous database of photos of people, hooked it up to a facial recognition algorithm, and then sold the results as a service designed to identify almost anybody, instantly. People called the technology “terrifying” and “dangerous,” and tech giants moved to end Clearview’s scraping of their photos for its collection. But whatever Clearview AI’s fate, some form of the idea it implemented is probably inevitable, especially with the approach of augmented reality eyewear. It’s all about timing, and Clearview AI’s service is too much too soon. The negative public reaction proves we still have an expectation of privacy on the web, and that it’s still possible for tech companies to cross “the creepy line,” as former Google CEO Eric Schmidt famously termed it.

A network of meme pages was created before its debut to ensure internet fame.,"Planters attempted to create a viral Super Bowl moment by bringing Mr. Peanut back as ""Baby Nut."" The move was evocative of Baby Yoda, but was clearly pre-planned as a branding effort. A series of meme pages were created before Baby Nut's rollout to spread memes about the character. The move could violate Twitter's rules against spam. Visit Insider's homepage for more stories .

To that end, we've long known that Samsung's new flagship line will bypass the S11 moniker and will instead be called the Galaxy S20 series. As a quick refresher, Samsung's Galaxy S20 lineup will consist of three devices: an entry-level Galaxy S20 with a 6.2-inch display, a Galaxy S20 Plus with a 6.7-inch display, and last but not least, a Galaxy S20 Ultra with a 6.9-inch display. In light of that, a new photo leak from Twitter ( via SamMobile ) provides us with perhaps our closest look yet at Samsung's next-gen smartphone lineup. The photo below isn't all that revealing, but it does give us an idea as to a) how the sizes of the varying S20 models differ and b) the extent to which the camera modules protrude from the backs of each device. Note that the camera bump on the S20 Ultra model is quite significant. This, however, shouldn't come as much of a surprise given how ambitious the S20 Ultra's camera scheme is.",TWTR,en,BGR.com

Sony and Microsoft might not be ready to tell us what their upcoming consoles will cost, but unofficial estimates already tell us they can’t match current prices.

2019-10-28 02:00:29-05:00,Facebook’s plan for radical transparency was too radical,"An unprecedented investigation into disinformation on Facebook has hit turbulence over questions about how much data to release to outside researchers, curtailing efforts to stem one of social media’s most pernicious threats ahead of the 2020 elections. The problem, according to Facebook and outside experts, is privacy: providing academics with even anonymized data about the links that users share on the platform—crucial to understanding how falsities spread—could in theory harm or identify individual users. The social networking giant is working to establish a template for sharing the data that ensures privacy, but academics are worried about the implications of the scrubbed data. Now the funders—who include the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, The Charles Koch Foundation, Omidyar Network’s Tech and Society Solutions Lab, and The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation—are reconsidering their commitment, putting some projects in jeopardy. “Without additional data, empirical investigations of social media manipulation in 2020 will not be possible,” says Tom Glaisyer, managing director of the Public Square program at the Democracy Fund, another of the project’s funders. “A healthy democracy needs a well-functioning digital public square and researchers need access to additional data if we are to have an election cycle that the American people can trust.” The effort was launched last spring with great fanfare by Facebook and with the establishment of an independent nonprofit, Social Science One, which is designed to ensure that outside researchers can trust the data and retain academic freedom.",TWTR,en,Fast Company

I take advantage of flight deals to save money, and use points and miles to cover the cost of flights when cash prices are high. Credit cards like the American Express® Gold Card earn me valuable points that I can use to cut down on out-of-pocket spending on flights. I love to travel, and I've gotten really good at finding deals and maximizing my points and miles balances so they work for me. While I still spend a fair amount of money on flights due to how much I fly, I get so much value out of my money, points, and miles by being strategic about how I use them. Here are the three simple ways I'm stretching my dollars further so that I can take over $12,000 worth of flights for less than $2,500 in one year. 1. I look for great flight deals I often don't decide where I'm traveling based on where I really want to go, but rather based on where I can find a good deal.","UBER,TWTR",en,Business Insider

2019-07-22 13:33:00-05:00,How to post a video on Twitter from your computer or mobile device,"Twitter makes it quick and easy to post videos within your tweets, allowing you to share all sorts of unique media with your followers. You can upload videos to tweets on Twitter from your computer or phone, or you can use a link from a site like YouTube to directly embed videos. Posting videos on Twitter allows you to share more content than you could through a text-based tweet with the platform's 280 character limit. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . When Twitter was first launched in 2006, the short-form social media post company limited each user's post, or ""tweet,"" to 140 characters, with spaces included in that count. In the fall of 2017, the company doubled the per-tweet character count to 280, but even these longer posts can still necessitate brevity or a message broken up over the course of a number of separate tweets. Sharing a video on Twitter allows you to post much more content than you could in character-limited posts. You could record yourself sharing a long message and tweet the video along with a pithy post, effectively increasing the amount of content you share.",TWTR,en,Business Insider
2019-07-22 11:01:00-05:00,How to change your Twitter username on a computer or mobile device,"Unlike some other popular social media platforms, Twitter allows you to change your username as often as you like, and the process only takes a few seconds. Your Twitter username, or ""handle,"" does not have to be a version of your real name, so you can use any playful, ironic, or anonymous handle you would like. Changing your Twitter username does not change your display name, so you can remain easily identifiable to followers even after your username is changed. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . Facebook only allows you to change your username once every few months, and the name you choose must be at least a reflection of your real legal name, though common sobriquets are acceptable. Twitter , on the other hand, has no such limitations in place when it comes to usernames. You can change your Twitter username daily if you so choose, and it can be anything you want, from a take on your own real name to an ironic play on a celebrity to a collection of random numbers and letters.",TWTR,en,Business Insider

YouTube may overhaul how it distributes children's content across its main platform due to a late-stage FTC investigation into its practices surrounding collection and use of data on children under the age of 13, per The Wall Street Journal.

Parents often use these platforms to spread misinformation about vaccine dangers that aren't real. Doctors say the content is having a dangerous impact on the number of vaccinated people in America, and that could have deadly consequences. ""I t is important that people be aware not just that these diseases still exist and can still debilitate and kill, but that vaccines are a safe, proven way to protect against them,"" the AMA letter states. Doctors think too many American kids are missing vaccinations, and that fake news spreading like wildfire on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube may be largely to blame. On Wednesday, the American Medical Association (AMA), the largest professional group of doctors in the US, sent an open letter to the CEOs of Amazon, Facebook, Google, Pinterest, Twitter and YouTube, voicing concern that parents are taking in all kinds of fake information about childhood vaccines from inaccurate videos, posts, and links on their platforms. ""P hysicians across the country are troubled by reports of anti-vaccine related messages and advertisements targeting parents searching for vaccine information on your platforms,"" AMA CEO James Madara wrote. ""We urge you to do your part to ensure that users have access to scientifically valid information on vaccinations, so they can make informed decisions about their families’ health."" The anti-vaxx content that's been cropping up on social media for years appears to be having a harmful effect: a recent UK study suggested that two in every five parents have been exposed to anti-vaccine content on social media, and more than one in four believe, wrongly, that a person can have ""too many"" vaccines.",TWTR,en,Business Insider

The crisis started on March 7 with a failure at the Guri hydroelectric power plant, which produces 80% of the country’s power. Additionally, an explosion was reported at Sidor Substation in Bolivar state. Since then, the government has been struggling to solve the crisis with varying success. President Nicholas Maduro says that the blackout is the reason of “the electric war announced and directed by American imperialism.” According to Maduro, electrical systems were targeted by cyberattacks and “infiltrators”. He added that authorities managed to restore power to “many parts” of the country on March 8, but the restored systems were knocked down after the country’s grid was once again attacked. He noted that “one of the sources of generation that was working perfectly” had been sabotaged and accused “infiltrators of attacking the electric company from the inside.” Communication and information minister Jorge Rodriguez described the situation as “the most brutal attack on the Venezuelan people in 200 years”.",TWTR,en,Zero Hedge

Look At Uganda,"Authored by Alex Kimani via Safehaven.com, The Arab Spring that destabilized governments in the Middle East began in the spring of 2011. Nearly a decade later, the full repercussions of the uprisings are starting to hit home with some governments adopting a new strategy to curtail their influence: taxing social media usage. Arab Spring protesters primarily used social media networks to successfully effect regime changes. And now some autocratic governments are hitting back by trying to limit citizens’ access to these tools. One such country is Uganda. The East African nation with a population of 43 million has become the latest country to attempt to gag the voice of its citizens after imposing a social media tax intended to ‘‘curb gossip.’’ The Ugandan government has introduced a tax of 200 Uganda shilling (5.4 cents) a day to use social sites such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and others.

The company's latest funding round, where it raised $300 million, assigned Reddit a valuation of $3 billion, according to a new CNBC article . CNBC had previously reported that the company's annual revenue was over $100 million, and with 330 million MAUs, this assigned an ARPU (average revenue per user) value of about $0.30 to Reddit's users. For comparison, Facebook recently reported 2.32 billion MAUs in its latest public report, which equates to an ARPU of about $7.37 - nearly 25x that of Reddit . Pinterest's estimated ARPU figure, based on a September article by the New York Times, is about $2.80 - a little more than 9x that of Reddit . Twitter's ARPU is nearly 32x that of Reddit.

2019-01-21 12:35:00-05:00,Visualizing The Jeff Bezos Empire In One Giant Chart,"With a fortune largely tied to his 79 million Amazon shares, the net worth of Jeff Bezos has continued to rise. Most recently, as Visual Capitalist's Jeff Desjardins points out, the Amazon founder was even able to surpass Bill Gates on the global wealth leaderboard with $137 billion to his name – however, this ascent to the very top may be extremely short-lived. On January 9th, 2019, Jeff Bezos announced on Twitter that he was divorcing MacKenzie Bezos, his wife of 25 years. While the precise ramifications of the news are not yet clear, it’s anticipated that MacKenzie Bezos could end up with a considerable portion of shares in Amazon as a result. There is much to be decided as the world’s wealthiest couple splits their assets – but for now, here is a list of what Jeff Bezos owns today. THE JEFF BEZOS EMPIRE IN 2019 Courtesy of: Visual Capitalist The obvious centerpiece to the Jeff Bezos Empire is the 16% ownership stake in Amazon.com. However, beyond that, there is a wide variety of other investments and acquisitions that Jeff Bezos has made through Amazon or his other investment vehicles.",TWTR,en,Zero Hedge

According to Okunoye, in 2018, repressive governments adopted yet another tactic: taxes on social media usage . In countries such as Uganda, Benin, Tanzania and Zambia, there are now laws in place which impose daily taxes on social media and other over-the-top services.

2019-01-13 23:30:00-05:00,The Rise Of Eurasia: Geopolitical Advantages & Historic Pitfalls,"Authored by James Dorsey via MidEastSoccer blog, Asian players are proving to be conceptually and bureaucratically better positioned in the 21st century’s Great Game that involves tectonic geopolitical shifts with the emergence of what former Portuguese Europe minister Bruno Macaes terms the fusion of Europe and Asia into a “supercontinent.” Yet, in contrast to the United States, Asian players - despite approaching Europe and Asia as one political, albeit polarized and disorganized entity populated by widely differing and competing visions - may find that their historic legacies work against them. Writing in The National Interest , US Naval College national security scholar Nikolas K. Gvosdev argued that the United States, for example, was blinded to the shifts by the State Department’s classification of Russia as part of Europe, its lumping of Central Asia together with Pakistan and India and the Pentagon’s association of the region with the Arab world and Iran. “The (State Department’s) continued inclusion of Russia within the diplomatic confines of a larger European bureau has intellectually limited assessments about Russia’s position in the world by framing Russian action primarily through a European lens.",TWTR,en,Zero Hedge

Many of the top websites in 1998 were basically news aggregators or search portals, which are easy concepts to understand. Today, brand touch-points are often spread out between devices (e.g. mobile apps vs. desktop site) and a myriad of services and sub-brands (e.g. Facebook’s constellation of apps). As a result, the world’s biggest websites are complex, interconnected web properties. Today’s visualization, inspired by an earlier work published by WaPo , looks at which of the internet giants have evolved to stay on top, and which have faded into internet lore.

2019-01-02 19:45:00-05:00,Happy De-Platforming: Truth Is The New 'Hate-Speech',"Authored by Eric Peters via EricPetersAutos.com, Just a quick post to thank all of you, the readers and contributors, for a great year and for making this possible. Most of you know that the organs (as Solzhenitsyn might have styled them) are using their effective monopoly control over all modern forms of communication – the Internet, social media – to stifle information and opinion that isn’t orthodox. For a brief decade or so, the Internet really was free. It enabled contrarian viewpoints to end-run what had been the information lockdown of pre-Internet media outlets – i.e., the major TV networks, of which there were just three; the major print media, of which there were also basically just three – The New York Times, Washington Post and LA Times – all of them run by the ideologically simpatico. That lockdown is in the process of being reasserted. It is being done by suppressing dissenting or just different viewpoints via what is styled (in the hideous jargon of technocratic tyranny) “de-platforming,” which means barring any person who produces “objectionable” material from making it available through entities such as YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and so on – all of them owned, it is important to point out, by the same cartel or might as well be – as in the case of the New York Times, Washington Post and LA Times.",TWTR,en,Zero Hedge
