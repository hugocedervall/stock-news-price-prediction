The highlight comes after the close when four of the five FAANGs open their books. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB ), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) results could help shape Friday’s market, though lately, earnings news has taken a back seat to worries about rising virus cases, the election, and lack of a fiscal stimulus. This is shaping up as the worst week for stocks since March. There’s a lot more below on what to expect from the FAANGs going into this climactic afternoon (see below chart), but to start things off, there’s some housekeeping as we sort through the morning’s data deluge. First, gross domestic product (GDP) for Q3 came in at a 33.1% seasonally adjusted rate. That was a bit better than the 30.2% analysts had expected, and seemed to put a charge back into stock futures an hour ahead of the open. By comparison, Q2 GDP fell 31.4%. Though the headline GDP number is a seasonally adjusted annual rate, it also helps to look at Q3 in isolation.","IP,IPHI",en,Benzinga

Arya named NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) his top large-cap semi stock pick of 2020 and Inphi Corporation (NYSE: IPHI ) his top small- and mid-cap semi pick for the year. Arya listed four reasons he remains a semi stock bull this year: After a 13% revenue drop in 2019, Bank of America is targeting 7% semiconductor revenue growth in 2020. Semis have high exposure to 2020 tech megatrends, such as 5G, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, and electric and autonomous vehicles. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China have eased, and global supply chains are balanced. Fund managers are currently overweight semis stocks by 1.2 times the overall S&P 500, well below their peak weighting of 1.36 times in March 2017.

If it follows through, the move could cripple China’s largest technology company, depress the business of American chip giants from Qualcomm Inc. to Micron Technology Inc., and potentially disrupt the rollout of critical 5G wireless networks around the world.“The Trump administration action is a grave escalation with China,” Eurasia Group analysts Paul Triolo, Michael Hirson and Jeffrey Wright wrote in a note. If fully implemented, the blacklist would “put at risk both the company itself and the networks of Huawei customers around the world, as the firm would be unable to upgrade software and conduct routine maintenance and hardware replacement.”The threat is likely to elevate fears in Beijing that President Donald Trump’s broader goal is to contain China, leading to a protracted cold war between the world’s biggest economies.","IPHI,INTC",en,The Economic Times India
