2019-08-28 11:30:11-05:00,Buying proven winners has been a market-crushing strategy this year. But one expert says it's gotten too expensive — and has formulated the perfect short bet.,"Sarah McCarthy, a global quant and European equity strategy researcher at Bernstein, advocates for a short position against high-momentum, low-growth stocks. Her thesis is built around stretched valuations, a voracious move lower in interest rates, and overweight hedge fund allocations. Click here for more BI Prime stories . The trend is your friend. This popular axiom has been adhered to for generations, and suggests an investor buy what's going up while selling what's declining. Don't try to be a hero, just ride the wave. The momentum approach — formally defined as buying stocks that have performed well over the previous three to 12 months, then selling those that have lagged over the same time period — has outperformed all other styles in the US in 2019, and on a long-short basis is up 11%. It's been an undeniable success. But Sarah McCarthy, a global quant and European equity strategy researcher at Bernstein , is starting to see cracks developing in the landscape — and she thinks it's setting up a perfect short. ""We are changing our view on Momentum, and specifically stocks which are high Momentum but not high Growth,"" she wrote in a client note. ""These stocks have benefitted from the continuation of the trend of falling bond yields (as Growth stocks have), but this recent acceleration of outperformance seems excessive and overly dependent on a continuation of the current macro path."" She continued: ""As a result, we recommend going short the companies that are high Momentum but are not high Growth."" The continuation of the aforementioned macro backdrop is key here.","WELL,WEC",en,Business Insider
