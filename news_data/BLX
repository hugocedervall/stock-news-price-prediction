2020-03-18 15:35:00-05:00,Solar Dominates Wind in New York’s Latest Renewable Procurement,"Two years ago, when New York state announced the first round of winners in its annual renewable energy procurements, upstate wind farms were the star of the show — including one of the largest wind projects ever put forward east of the Mississippi River. Jump to today, and solar utterly dominated New York’s latest onshore renewables round, reflecting the general direction in which the U.S. power market is expected to move over the next few years. In its third annual land-based renewables round, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, or NYSERDA, selected 21 large-scale projects totaling 1.3 gigawatts to receive around $1 billion of state support. The projects will be built over the next few years. The list of winners includes just one large wind project — a 145-megawatt development backed by Terra-Gen — alongside a handful of refurbishments of existing wind farms, known as repowerings, that will add only a small amount of new generating capacity. The rest of the projects are all large-scale solar arrays, from a series of 20-megawatt projects to the massive 270-megawatt South Ripley solar development in western New York that will be built with 20 megawatt-hours of storage by developer ConnectGen.",BLX,en,Green Technology

Perhaps it’s because, unlike traditional markets which trade according to hours or business, digital assets are on the go 24-7.

Furthermore, the fact that some of them have even dominated the mainstream news is a testament to how far cryptocurrency has evolved from its cypherpunk roots. Libra It’s hard to imagine that at the start of 2019, the idea of a Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB ) cryptocurrency was mere speculation. In June, when the company announced its intentions in June, the price of Bitcoin (NASDAQ: BLX ) rocketed to its 2019 high of over $13,000. However, the regulators quickly swooped in.
