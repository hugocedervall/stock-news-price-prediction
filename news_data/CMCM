That's well above rivals like US-based Snap Inc (it's $3 billion more than WeWork's 'peak' paper valuation), and a staggering 50x TikTok's projected 2020 revenue of $1 billion. But with CFIUS ratcheting up the pressure on ByteDance to either transfer control of TikTok to a US-based entity, or risk a possible ban in its most popular market (ByteDance also owns Douyin, a clone of TikTok made for mainland Chinese audiences), several of ByteDance's venture capital backers from Silicon Valley are getting anxious. Which is why they're trying to convince ByteDance to join them in a bold new plan: Transfer control of TikTok to them .",CMCM,en,Zero Hedge

2020-06-30 03:37:33-05:00,India's ban on Chinese apps: What next?,"BENGALURU/NEW DELHI: Monday’s interim order by the government of India blocking 59 apps could potentially reset an entire ecosystem built by a plethora of Chinese mobile apps in specific categories, including short-video, where TikTok and Likee have come to dominate the markets. These apps are among those affected by the order, handing an almost overnight boost to local rivals like ShareChat and Roposo — who have been riding on the anti-China sentiment.The interim order, issued on Monday evening, has been sent to all relevant intermediaries, including the app owners, those that facilitate access to the app (App Stores), and internet service providers and telecom networks. The ByteDance-owned TikTok, for instance, has already complied with the order, voluntarily taking down its app Monday night from the Google Play Store and Apple’s AppStore.TikTok will also likely geofence its app, cutting access to 200 million users it claimed to have prior to the ban. Its executives will have to attend a hearing of government officials by a committee from the Home Ministry, Ministry of Electronics and Information and Technology (Meity), Law Ministry and CERT-In, according to sources. “In all likelihood, this will be a routine meeting, where they are given a chance to make their representations before the order is confirmed,” said a person aware of developments surrounding the ban.",CMCM,en,Economic Times India

There's just so many -- and today, Google added to the pile, with a major crackdown that includes kicking almost 600 apps out of the Play Store. Google hasn't as of the time of this writing identified which specific apps were part of this enforcement, which seems largely to have focused on ad fraud, though Per Bjorke, Google’s senior product manager for ad traffic quality, has said the apps were mostly games and utilities. Unfortunately, this action comes after the apps had collectively garnered more than 4.5 billion installs. In a company blog post authored by Bjorke and published today, the apps were said to be banned for ""violating our disruptive ads policy and disallowed interstitial policy ."" The post goes on to note that Google defines disruptive ads as those which are displayed to users in unexpected ways -- and which impair or interfere with ""the usability of device functions."" They can occur in-app, but Google says one form of disruptive ads it's seen on the rise are so-called out-of-context ads.",CMCM,en,BGR.com
