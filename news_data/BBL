Short sellers lost money on 78 out of the 100 stocks that make up the UK’s blue-chip index during November, according to new data from Ortex Analytics, as global equity markets rallied on the back of the US presidential result and a series of positive breakthroughs on Covid-19 vaccines. The hefty hit – which totalled GBP1.1 billion – torpedoed the GBP828 million gain made by short sellers in October. Last month’s losses were more than double the GBP420 million slide suffered in August by bearish managers. Negative positions in BHP Group proved to be the least profitable bet overall for hedge funds last month, bringing losses of some GBP249.4 million to those betting against the global mining firm.",BBL,en,Hedgeweek

2020-10-21 19:59:27-05:00,China Has Copper Flying Like a FANG Stock,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Copper has touched $7,000 per metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, having climbed roughly 60% from a late-March nadir. The industrial metal is trading at levels unseen since 2018 despite a surge in coronavirus infections in Europe and beyond, stockpiles rising off recent lows, and expectations of a surplus in 2021. The reason is China, which is dominating the 24-million-ton per year market like never before thanks to a recovery that is outpacing other economies.The metal’s rebound from four-year lows in March mirrors the rally in that other gravity-defying asset class, the FANG-powered U.S. stock market. Copper’s rally has exceeded expectations, given that the most pessimistic forecasts for pandemic-related supply disruptions haven’t been borne out. Peru’s production fell in August from a month earlier, hit by worker shortages, but output in Chile, the world’s top exporter, increased. BHP Group-operated Escondida, the Chilean copper mine that’s the world’s largest, avoided a strike last week, even if workers at Lundin Mining Corp.’s far smaller Candelaria downed tools in the country.China’s industrial production gained momentum to rise a forecast-beating 6.9% in September from a year earlier; excavator demand has jumped, along with car sales.",BBL,en,Yahoo Finance

The FTSE 100 was one of the worst-performing major indices in Europe in September, as a surge in cases of COVID-19 and tighter restrictions on movement, coupled with renewed concern over Brexit, hit UK assets harder than most regional markets.

Overall, short sellers made a profit on 53 out of the 100 companies in the index.

Overall, short sellers made gains from more than half of all FTSE 100-listed companies (53 out of 100), according to new data from Ortex Analytics, with Rolls Royce proving to be the most profitable wager, bringing in GBP187.7 million for bearish managers. September’s bounce-back marks a reversal of fortunes for hedge funds betting against FTSE 100 companies, an index often seen as a bellwether for investor confidence. In August, managers suffered a GBP420 million hit after UK equity market gains sent many sizable short bets southwards. Peter Hillerberg, co-founder of London-based equity research firm Ortex, noted that four of the five most profitable shorts in September had earlier been significant loss-makers in August, underlining how renewed uncertainty over the Covid-19 pandemic has underpinned the rebound. “Last month we saw a number of big trades turn sour for short-sellers which impacted overall profitability in August,” Hillerberg observed. “At the time, we predicted that the pendulum may swing back the other way in September and that’s exactly what we’ve seen as short sellers continue to profit from the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic.” Among the big bets to pay off were International Consolidated Airlines Group, owner of British Airways, Aer Lingus and Iberian.","BAB,BBL",en,Hedgeweek

We will discuss the African upstream trends observed over the last decade - providing some insight into the evolving strategies of regionally grouped companies and attempting to make sense of these in the context of the most recent crash. We will also look at exploration activity over the same period with the view to drawing insights from the 2014 crash and applying those to the current environment and outlook. A drama in three acts Three distinct periods are defined within the scope of this article, driven by crashes in the oil price: A) Pre-2014 crash Between 2010 and 2014, oil was trading in the region of USD 100/bbl and Africa was attracting significant interest from large European, North American and Asian oil and gas companies.",BBL,en,IHS Markit

A key part of the Paris Agreement encourages countries to agree on carbon trading systems in pursuit of climate change goals, and IETA's government council said it would push for governments and organisations to step up their climate ambitions to net zero by the middle of the century. ""IETA's work with governments around the world will emphasise the importance of accelerating work to make the 'net' operational so that 'net zero' is achievable,"" said Dirk Forrister, president and CEO of IETA. ""By this, we mean that policies should enable companies and sectors to cooperate through trading policies, including use of natural climate solutions and a wide range of technological removals."" ""International cooperation through markets will be essential for achieving net zero, because not every country has the same opportunities to reduce or remove greenhouse gases - while others have more opportunities than they need,"" he continued. ""The trading system envisioned in Article 6 [of the Paris Agreement] will bring these opportunities and needs together for mutual benefit of the countries involved - advancing the global goal.""

2020-02-24 18:01:36-05:00,Europe's biggest firms are putting €124bn towards net zero - but is it enough?,"CDP analysis of more than 800 companies shows corporate green investment is growing, but businesses must now double down to achieve net zero Many of Europe's biggest companies now appear to be recognising both the necessity of the low carbon transition and the opportunities that should arise from deep decarbonisation, as they mobilised capital investment to the tune of €124bn behind clean technologies and R&D initiatives last year. But despite the surge in clean tech-related spending, the scale of green investment these firms are offering at present remains far from the level needed to shield them against transition risks and ensure the world has a reasonable chance of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. That is the stark conclusion of new analysis today from CDP, which argued European companies must double their average share of capital expenditure on low carbon investments from 12 per cent in 2019, to at least 25 per cent in order to be consistent with a 2050 net zero pathway. The investor-backed carbon disclosure non-profit analysed the capital expenditure reported by 882 major European firms in 2019, collectively responsible for more than three quarters - around 3.2 gigatonnes - of the entire continent's total greenhouse gas emissions, as well as 76 per cent of European market capitalisation.",BBL,en,BusinessGreen

But while solar and wind have an obvious role to play in helping miners control their carbon emissions, the mining industry faces steep decarbonization challenges, analysts say. Rio Tinto, the Anglo-Australian mining giant, says it will invest $98 million in a 34-megawatt PV array and 12 megawatt-hour lithium-ion battery system to help power its Koodaideri mine in Pilbara, Australia. The solar plant is expected to cover all of the mine’s electric power needs during peak solar generation hours, and 65 percent of its overall electricity consumption. Rio Tinto will start building the plant soon and is looking to complete it next year. “We are investigating additional renewable energy options in the Pilbara, as well as other opportunities to reduce emissions across our entire global portfolio,” said Rio Tinto Iron Ore chief executive Chris Salisbury in a statement.",BBL,en,Green Technology

To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here . Bank of America’s (BofA) tech and operations chief, Cathy Bessant, has expressed skepticism on the benefits of blockchain, despite the bank having received or applied for 82 patents for the technology, the most among financial institutions (FIs), per CNBC.

Notably, Besser also stated that she hasn’t seen a use case that makes a lot of sense for finance or that considerably enhances current methods. Here’s what it means: Bessant’s comments add further fuel to the ongoing debate about the prospects of the technology.",BBL,en,Business Insider
