Sterling was little changed at $1.3191 as of 4:38 p.m on Monday in London.“The prospect of a no-deal exit still involves a substantial decline in sterling’s value, as the fragile U.K. economy experiences another downside shock that can’t be met with wide-sweeping fiscal stimulus measures, and is likely to involve negative rates from the Bank of England,” said Simon Harvey, a foreign-exchange analyst at Monex Europe.Leaving with no agreement at all would bring additional difficulties to businesses in the form of new trade barriers and quotas. The U.K. economy is already under strain, with growth further below its pre-crisis levels than any other Group-of-Seven economy.That said, the results were less pessimistic than data gathered from a similar survey in June, which showed respondents expected the pound to slump to $1.18 if there’s no deal.",CM,en,Yahoo Finance
