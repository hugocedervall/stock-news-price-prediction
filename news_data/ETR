2020-11-17 12:05:00-05:00,How to Build a Green Hydrogen Economy for the U.S. West,"Out in Utah, a coal-fired power plant supplying electricity to Los Angeles is being outfitted with natural gas-fired turbines that will eventually be able to run on hydrogen, created via electrolysis with wind and solar power, and stored in massive underground caverns for use when that clean energy isn’t available for the grid. This billion dollar-plus project could eventually expand to more renewable-powered electrolyzers, storage and generators to supply dispatchable power for the greater western U.S. grid. It could also grow to include hydrogen pipelines to augment and replace the natural gas used for heating and industry or supply hydrogen fuel cell vehicle fleets across the region. That’s the vision of the Western Green Hydrogen Initiative ( WGHI ), a group representing 11 Western states, two Canadian provinces and key green hydrogen industry players including Mitsubishi and utilities Dominion Energy and Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. WGHI launched Tuesday to align state and federal efforts to create “a regional green hydrogen strategy,” including “a large scale, long-duration, renewable energy storage regional reserve.” At the heart of this effort are two projects in central Utah.",ETR,en,Green Technology Media

If accurate, the news marks the latest unsuccessful attempt by the U.S. renewable energy leader to take advantage of its high stock price to expand its roster of regulated utilities. Evergy representatives did not immediately reply to Greentech Media’s request for comment on Reuters’ anonymously sourced report, which stated that the all-stock acquisition offer was rejected by Evergy in recent days. Debbie Larsson, a spokesperson for NextEra Energy, said in a Tuesday interview with Greentech Media that the company does not comment on market rumors as a matter of policy. Evergy, which serves 1.6 million customers in Kansas and Missouri, was formed in 2018 by the merger of Westar Energy and Kansas City Power & Light parent company Great Plains Energy. It was under pressure from shareholder Elliott Management Corp. to seek a buyer last year, but its board of directors acted to forestall the prospect of a takeover.","ETR,EVRG",en,Green Technology Media

This week's round was led by Clean Energy Ventures , Skyview Ventures, and Avista Development, the unregulated arm of Pacific Northwest utility Avista. The round brings the Arlington, Va.-based startup's total funding to date to about $11 million, including a $1.1 million Series A in 2017, and about $850,000 in funding from early-stage sources including the Energy Department’s SunShot Initiative. ConnectDER’s role with SunShot was to tap the potential of the meter socket — the round hole where the typical North American meter plugs into a building’s electrical system — as “an underutilized asset for onboarding DERs to the grid,” CEO Whit Fulton said. Distributed energy resources primarily refer to rooftop solar panels, but DERs can also include behind-the-meter batteries, plug-in electric vehicles, smart appliances or home energy controls.",ETR,en,Green Technology
