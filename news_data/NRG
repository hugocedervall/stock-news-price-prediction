2020-10-07 10:10:00-05:00,Morgan Stanley expects more mega-mergers in the oil industry. Here are the 11 deals the bank says are most likely.,"Summary List Placement Hammered by a collapse in oil prices, the energy industry is entering a new phase focused on returns, which is likely to bring a wave of consolidation, analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note Wednesday. Deals could help US oil companies Exxon and Chevron diversify and build out their clean-energy assets, they said. ""European peers have begun to reposition portfolios away from oil & gas production,"" the analysts said in the note. ""Majors in the US have been slower to adapt despite sharing similar advantages of scale. Focusing on M&A in the power sector, companies with renewable development capabilities could be particularly attractive alternatives to oil & gas."" Today, the energy industry remains fragmented, the analysts said, resulting in a recent spike in deals. Most notably, Chevron acquired Noble Energy in early October through a $5 billion all-stock deal, while shale giants Devon Energy and WPX Energy announced plans to merge in late September. Read more: Layoffs, bankruptcies, and dividend cuts: We're tracking how 20 energy giants from Shell to Exxon are responding to the collapse in oil prices ""M&A has picked up again and, largely for the first time in recent memory, been rewarded by the market,"" Morgan Stanley said. ""We expect that to continue."" The bank says future deals are most likely between companies focused on oil production, and among the largest integrated oil majors and smaller energy producers.","NRG,NOV",en,Business Insider

Wilson found the group together by tracking five years of price and profit data for 1,500 companies. These stocks have historically displayed a tight relationship between their earnings and price movements, and he says that's evidence a ""catch up trade"" could develop.

It sounds like the simplest idea possible. But can be a giant gap between an idea and the execution of it. When Michael Wilson, chief US equity strategist and chief investment office for Morgan Stanley, implemented this basic, almost value-investing-style approach, he wanted to find the stocks with the most promise possible.

2019-05-08 12:57:55-05:00,Utilities sector the only 1 of 11 S&P 500 sectors to lose ground as Treasury yields bounce,"Shares of utility companies were broadly lower Wednesday, with the sector the only one of the S&P 500's 11 sectors to lose ground, weighed down by a big bounce in Treasury yields. The SPDR Utilities Select Sector ETF shed 1.0% in afternoon trade, with 27 of 28 equity components losing ground. The biggest decliner was NRG Energy Inc.'s stock which slumped 5.1%. Among other more active utilities ETF components, shares of AES Corp. lost 2.3%, Excelon Corp. gave up 0.9% and Southern Co. shed 0.6%. The lone gainer was Sempra Energy's stock which tacked on 0.6%. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose 3.6 basis points to 2.484%, after falling 10.4 basis points the previous three sessions, as a bounce in the stock market helped calm risk-off trades. Utilities stocks tend to have relatively high dividend yields, so a rise in yields on low-risk Treasurys make them less attractive. The utilities ETF's dividend yield is 3.15%, compared with the implied yield for the S&P 500 of 1.99%, according to FactSet.",NRG,en,MarketWatch
