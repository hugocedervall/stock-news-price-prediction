Addressing this, Goldman sent an email early on Monday in which the bank made the following points for those looking at energy debt: Credit markets were having problems before the Saudi announcement, credit down when equities traded higher Significant increase in non-credit accounts looking to short the sector last week Last week saw record outflow across IG, high yield and loans Liquidity issue even more prevalent because of virus related contingency / BCP planning The bank concludes by noting that "" although clients are better positioned than in 2015 (when had a lot of energy issuance to fund shale revolutions); expect continued selling as oil re-prices lower and the virus spreads.""
