The question everyone has, especially Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy and Robinhood traders, is when the Great Cruise Shutdown of 2020 will end? While some cruise ship operations have resumed in Europe, many operations in North America remain closed. The CDC recently extended a no-sail order for U.S.-based cruise ships through Oct. 31, which could pave the way for a possible November restart. However, a November restart seems unlikely as the U.S. has made little progress in lowering its baseline of COVID-19 cases . After President Trump announced Friday that he and his wife tested positive for the virus, the U.S.'s average daily new cases on Friday stood around 46,300. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the NIAID and member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said not too long ago, that ""no matter how you slice it, that's not good."" He referred to the plus 40,000 caseloads per day, warning that the U.S. is headed ""into a more problematic winter.""
