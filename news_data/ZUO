2019-12-19 10:31:45-05:00,"Here's how the 2008 financial crisis led to the dominance of subscriptions in the software industry, and why they're here to stay in the cloud era","Over the last two decades, software has slowly shifted from a traditional licensing model to a cloud-based subscription model. Cloud companies like Salesforce pioneered the model, but experts say the 2008 financial crisis was the inflection point — as companies cut costs, the pay-as-you-go model became very attractive. Companies like Adobe and Microsoft made the switch to focus on a subscription model and have reaped the rewards, as their businesses boom. Subscription software companies say that the model is actually better for users — the software gets more features, more often, and customers don't have to pay a high sticker price up front to get started. However, critics note that over the course of the lifetime of a subscription, users will often pay more than they would have if they bought the software outright. Experts say the model is here to stay: It makes it easy for corporate customers to sign on small teams to use specialized, industry-specific tools, just for starters. But they say that privacy and security are going to be big shadows over the market, especially thanks to laws like the EU's GDPR.",ZUO,en,Business Insider
