Being unique — and balancing that with saving money — is a defining trait of this generation. Amanda Chernin, age 20, from Delray Beach, Florida, says she shops online almost every day. She is not loyal to any one brand or store. Instead, she shops wherever is most affordable. She rarely goes to a physical store to try clothes on, and if she ends up not liking a piece she buys, she resells it online.
