2020-10-27 23:08:27-05:00,Net Zero Festival: Changing diets for a changing climate,"VIDEO: Mike Barry hosts a discussion with a host of experts on delivering a more sustainable food system including Nomad Foods' Annelie Selander; PepsiCo's Chris Daly, Nando's Henry Unwin, University of Oxford's Michael Clark, and the Food Foundation's Rebecca Tobi The food system has many long, complex supply chains with huge numbers of different producers and retailers spanning the journey from farm to fork. But it is a system that is facing huge threats from the physical impacts of climate change such as drought, floods and crop failure, while disruption from the growing interest in plant-based alteratives to meat and dairy products also poses a threat to the status quo. It is, in short, a sector that is ripe for disruption, and one that is crucial to delivering the world's climate goals, by fostering a shift to more sustainable diets among consumers marked by less meat and dairy, and produce that does not fuel deforestation. But that means big changes for consumers, and only with their backing can those changes take place.",NOMD,en,BusinessGreen

2020-09-07 06:26:09-05:00,Spacs – a quirky sideshow or the future of investment?,"Spacs – a quirky sideshow or the future of investment? Submitted 07/09/2020 - 12:26pm By Richard Beresford, partner and chairman of McCarthy Denning – Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (Spacs) have been grabbing the headlines recently in the US, with record amounts being raised for these so-called “blank-cheque” companies: over USD27.5 billion so far this year, including the USD4 billion garnered by Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Tontine Holdings. That is by far the largest amount ever raised by a single blank cheque vehicle. Not only have the amounts raised been rising, but there has been a shift in focus towards Silicon Valley, with veteran tech VC players, such as Kevin Hartz, who was an early backer of Airbnb and Uber, joining the stream of promoters bringing vehicles to the market. These players are reportedly seeking to take advantage of the reported backlog of privately held tech companies looking for further funding and a public listing. In the US, Spacs are viewed by many as a legitimate way to speed up and de-risk the IPO process for the private companies they target to take to the market.",NOMD,en,PrivateEquityWire

2020-02-10 12:49:48-05:00,3 Hidden Gems Setting Up for Big Upside,"It’s tempting – really, it is – to just put your investment money into the big-name stocks. After all, they generate the headlines, and they generate some spectacular results. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google parent Alphabet have all broken above $1 trillion market cap.
