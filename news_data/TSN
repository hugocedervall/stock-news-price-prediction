A report late last month from Resilience360, a product of DHL, found that the shutdown of manufacturing plants, changing consumer behaviors and price increases have altered F&B supply chains, at least in the near term and perhaps for the long term. ""The pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities of an industry historically reliant on manual labor,"" the report, "" COVID-19 exposes vulnerabilities in the global food supply chain ,"" noted. ""In the long term, companies can introduce more automation and robotics technology in their supply chain to address labor shortages to mitigate the impact of future crises."" The report noted that many F&B producers were not prepared for staffing shortages due to COVID-related shutdowns and exposure to the virus. ""This shift has exposed deficiencies in the resilience of the sector,"" it said. ""It has highlighted the industry's overreliance on manual labor and, as such, has supported the argument that the industry needs a higher prioritization on automation."" Plant closures and changes to operating procedures – including socially distancing workers – contributed to overall labor reductions and limiting production.

Figuring out the best way to feed everyone so they receive enough nutritious food, while using the planet’s finite resources sustainably, is a growing challenge.

An alternative to that consumption could exist. Alternative proteins, that is. Alternative proteins, which have gained more mainstream attention in U.S. supermarkets and direct-to-consumer models during the COVID-19 pandemic, include both plant-based or food-technology (so-called ""clean meat"") alternatives to animal protein.

The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) plans this summer to propose a new rule to allow young chicken plants to maximize their line speeds, a move likely to draw the ire of consumer and animal welfare groups. Appearing for the first time in the Spring 2020 Unified Agenda, the proposal would spell out the criteria for certain plants under the New Poultry Inspection System (NPIS) to operate at line speeds up to 175 birds per minute. The poultry industry says the faster line speeds are critical to stay competitive in the global market. But the issue has become a lightning rod for consumer groups, who are also suing FSIS over the agency's October 2019 rule to modernize hog processing. Along with modernizing the processing of poultry and hogs, FSIS approved a petition in March that granted Tyson Foods the first waiver to change line speeds and inspection staffing at its Kansas beef plant.

And those are the only the most obvious essential services provided by the land. When well managed the land helps regulate water and air quality, sequester and store carbon, and minimise flood and soil erosion risks. On top of that, the land plays host to much of the planet's biodiversity, providing incalculable benefits to humanity and the global economy, starting with the pollination that underpins the global food system.
