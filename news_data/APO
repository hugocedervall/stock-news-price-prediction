2020-11-23 16:43:29-05:00,Apollo Global enters race for BPCL stake,"Mumbai | New Delhi: Apollo Global Management has submitted an expression of interest (EoI) for the government’s 53 per cent stake in Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL), said people with knowledge of the matter. The move underscores the growing appetite of the Wall Street buyout group founded by Leon Black for big-ticket deals in India after having recently dissolved its joint venture platform Aion Capital with ICICI Venture. Apollo will compete with Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta that has also confirmed its participation at this stage. It’s likely to partner with a global energy major ahead of its final offer, said the people cited above. Potential bidders have 45 days after submitting the EoI to put together a consortium. Bid dates are not yet clarified but are expected in March 2021. Apollo has a dedicated natural resources investment franchise with $5 billion of assets under management, owning oil and gas assets predominantly in the Americas. Its flagship PE fund had pipped Reliance Industries Ltd for Lloyndell Bassel in 2010, eventually making a $10 billion profit out of the deal, the biggest in the Wall Street history by a buyout group.At Monday’s closing price of Rs 394.55 on the BSE, the government’s stake in BPCL is worth Rs 45,276 crore. 79380149Open Offer MustApart from a control premium, any acquirer will have to make an open offer for 26 per cent from the public — worth Rs 22,252 crore at current prices.Apollo and the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (Dipam) didn’t respond to queries.In September, Apollo forged a $5.5 billion real estate investment partnership with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), one of the big Gulf oil companies that was originally expected to join the race for BPCL.Government officials handling the sale have not revealed the identities of investors that submitted EoIs by the November 16 deadline, only saying they had got three to four from global funds and a major foreign company.",APO,en,Economic Times India

The cause of death wasn't immediately known. Solow was a bold-faced name among a generation of New York City builders who amassed great fortunes raising office and residential towers beginning in the mid 20th-century, decades before commercial real-estate largely became the province of investment firms, pension funds, and public companies. Solow's death potentially leaves billions of dollars of high-profile assets in flux. And the market for such property is uncertain amid an economic downturn and a pandemic that could rewrite values for office and residential space in the city as tenants embrace remote work and residents have fled the city. Stefan Soloviev, Solow's 44-year-old son, had been increasingly involved in his father's real-estate empire in recent years, but it remains unclear whether he will take the mantle of Solow Building Management, his family's real-estate firm, or move to sell properties within its portfolio.",APO,en,Business Insider

It wasn't the first time that Big Law attorneys struck it big investing in a client, and it probably won't be the last.

Before the dot-com bust, some of those stakes were valued in the tens of millions of dollars. Investing in clients has always been somewhat fraught, with some legal ethics professionals saying it can cloud a lawyer's professional judgment and lead to conflicts. That's why firms that do take a stake in clients often take a relatively small one, and often just for part of the fees that they charge, with the rest paid in cash, according to published accounts .
