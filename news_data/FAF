But housing construction has lagged demand in the years since the Great Recession, with single-family housing starts in particular declining in the last decade despite a continuously growing population. Home construction and sales have quickly rebounded after being slammed by the economic turmoil caused by the pandemic in the spring. New privately-owned housing starts rose for three-straight months before declining by 5.1% in August from July's revised figure of 1.492 million. A large monthly decline in starts for multi-family units, like apartments, contributed to the overall decline. Single-family starts also rose by 4.1% in August to 1.021 million, the highest rate since February's figure of 1.034 million as reported by The Wall Street Journal .
