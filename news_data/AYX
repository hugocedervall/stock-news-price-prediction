2020-04-29 07:15:00-05:00,An expert tech investor beating 97% of his peers reveals the most important trends in his portfolio — and breaks out his top 3 stock picks for the next decade,"Randall Dishmon manages the Invesco Oppenheimer Global Focus Fund, which is delivering positive returns and beating 97% of its competition this year. Dishmon says he seeks out structural trends that will last for years and then finds multiple ways to invest in them. He notes that a powerful enough trend will help numerous companies thrive, and will also result in clearly defined losers. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . It's easy to think of all things that have been stopped by the coronavirus pandemic, like travel, movies, and restaurants — but Randall Dishmon's portfolio is thriving because he invested in things that grew stronger.
