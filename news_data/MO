Sign up here to get it in your inbox every week . If you want a discount to BI Prime to read our stories, sign up here! Happy Friday readers, We're back after a two-week hiatus. The East Coast saw a nice run of summer swell, so my vacation was perfectly timed to take in some (surf)board meetings. Prior to my vacation, I spent a few weeks talking to former employees and investors about what happened at Civilized , a cannabis media and events company that quietly laid off all of its employees after a takeover offer fell through. In the span of a little more than a year, the company's CEO, Derek Riedle, went from flying on private jets with celebrities to laying off employees without severance pay. Civilized's rise and fall is perhaps emblematic of what happened in the past two years in the cannabis industry, where the promise of a new multibillion-dollar industry met a more subdued reality, and greed got in the way of responsible decisionmaking.",MO,en,Business Insider

How does 2020 look? A: In preparing to close out 2019, it can be helpful to look back and reflect on how the market has evolved. It has been a tumultuous couple of years: In October 2018, a landmark year ended as Canada legalized its nationwide adult-use program. That was followed by the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill which federally legalized hemp in the United States for the first time in seven decades. Substantial investments — including Constellation Brand's sizeable stake in Canopy Growth , Altria's investment in Cronos , and the partnership agreement between Novartis and Tilray — prompted widespread speculation and the inflation of stock prices. The cash inflow was utilized to expand both internally and internationally as corporations jockeyed for their positions in a growing and volatile market.

2019-04-18 08:00:00-05:00,North America is a Pace Setter for the Burgeoning Cannabis Industry,"NEW YORK , April 18, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- The tremendous growth of the cannabis market is causing the marketspace to become an emerging global industry. In 2017, U.S. cannabis legal sales were between USD 5.8 Billion and USD 6.6 Billion , according to Marijuana Business Factbook. Perhaps surprisingly, the industry's market value is already comparable to major worldwide corporations such as Netflix and McDonald's. However, the market is still heavily hindered by regulatory restrictions imposed by federal governments around the world. Under international regulations, cannabis is one of the most heavily enforced drugs, primarily due to the psychoactive effects of marijuana. The marijuana plant is comprised primarily of THC, which causes the psychoactive effects. However, the cannabis plant is split into marijuana and hemp, with hemp being the non-psychoactive derivative of the cannabis plant. While the two differ in their makeup, they both offer therapeutic benefits, causing a surge in adoption for medical applications.",MO,en,Benzinga

2019-03-28 03:00:20-05:00,"Airliners, E-Cigs Dent America’s Self-Regulating Credibility","(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- Just the barest facts are unsettling. A federal regulator in the U.S. routinely permits a major American manufacturer to certify that its products are safe. Then, in recent months, 346 people perish. The company, of course, is Boeing Co.; the regulator is the Federal Aviation Administration. And while both say they did nothing wrong, the finer points of how the agency relied on the jetmaker’s assurances about the safety of flight-control software suspected in the crashes of two of its 737 Max jetliners are now the subject of federal investigations. The self-regulatory freedom enjoyed by Boeing is common in the U.S. And it raises questions about the efficacy of the nation’s consumer-protection system, long the envy of the world and part of the reason American products are trusted more than those of many other countries. “You guys know what you’re talking about, so you come up with the details, and you handle it” Virginia Haufler, an associate professor of government and politics at University of Maryland and author of A Public Role for the Private Sector: Industry Self-Regulation in a Global Economy, attributes the spread of self-regulation to a broader global embrace of deregulation.",MO,en,Bloomberg
