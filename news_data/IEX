2019-02-13 21:06:45-05:00,"ICE To Implement ""Flash Boys"" HFT Speed Bump To Stop Gold, Silver Manipulation","Now that it's a widely accepted ""conspiracy theory"" that the next time markets crash, the blame will be laid squarely on algos and HFTs (as December demonstrated so vividly) if only to divert attention from the true central bank culprits for the biggest asset bubble in history, it is no longer perceived as a conflict of interest by exchanges to lash out against what until recently were some of their best clients. As a result, several years after the protagonists of Michael Lewis' ""Flash Boys"", the IEX Group, introduced a ""speed bump"" delay on their stock exchange in 2016 to prevent frontrunning by high-frequency traders, it's now the turn of the Intercontinental Exchange to join the battle against the fastest traders. According to the CFTC, the Atlanta-based exchange plans to introduce a 3-millisecond trading delay, one which it calls Passive Order Protection. What is even more interesting is where said delay will be implemented: according to the regulatory filing, the speed bump will be first used on exchange's gold and silver futures contracts ""where the ICE currently does very little business"", effectively confirming that the gold and silver futures market is where market manipulation by algos has been most rife (something which we already knew thanks to such chronic market manipulators as Deutsche Bank and UBS).",IEX,en,Zero Hedge
