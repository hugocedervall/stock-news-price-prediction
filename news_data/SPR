Earlier on Dec. 20, Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE: SPR ) of Wichita, Kansas, announced it will stop building fuselages for the 737 MAX on Jan. 1, as the effects of the aircraft's grounding following two deadly crashes extend down the supply chain and begin to impact the broader economy. The moves come after Boeing Co . (NYSE: BA ) said Dec. 16 it would shut down the 737 MAX production line in January in response to the longer-than-expected review being conducted by the Federal Aviation Administration to recertify the plane for commercial service. Boeing has developed a software fix for its automated flight control system implicated in the crashes and new procedures for training pilots how to interact with it, but FAA officials say nearly a dozen milestones must still be completed before they can give the green light to fly again.

Accordingly, Spirit will suspend 737 MAX production beginning on Jan. 1 . Spirit will continue to communicate with Boeing regarding the timetable for resuming production.

A Boeing deixará de fabricar em janeiro o modelo 737 Max Getty Images A americana Boeing decidiu suspender em janeiro a fabricação de seu problemático avião 737 Max. A produção da aeronave havia sido mantida mesmo durante o período de nove meses em que o modelo foi proibido de voar em razão de dois acidentes fatais em 2018 e 2019. Mais de 300 pessoas morreram na queda de 737 Max na Indonésia e na Etiópia, em decorrência de problemas de fabricação da aeronave. A Boeing esperava que os aviões voltassem a voar no fim deste ano, mas autoridades reguladoras dos Estados Unidos deixaram claro que não iriam avalizar tão cedo esse retorno. A companhia americana, uma das maiores exportadoras do país, afirmou em comunicado que não vai demitir os funcionários ligados à fabricação do 737 Max, mas a paralisação deve afetar sua cadeia produtiva e a economia como um todo. ""A retomada com segurança do 737 Max é nossa principal prioridade"", disse a empresa. ""Nós sabemos que o processo de aprovação do retorno do 737 Max à operação, e a definição dos treinamentos necessários, deve ser algo extraordinariamente preciso e robusto, para asseguar que nossos reguladores, clientes e passageiros confiem nas melhorias do 737 Max.""

On Friday (Dec. 6), the Federal Aviation Administration said it intends to issue a $3.9 million fine against the aircraft manufacturer for installing substandard components on about 133 narrowbody 737 jetliners that posed a safety risk. It's the latest in a series of embarrassments for the Chicago manufacturer related to production, safety and government contracting. The FAA alleged Boeing failed to adequately oversee suppliers to ensure they complied with the company's quality assurance system. The agency contends the failure resulted in the installation of slat tracks that were weakened later during the metal-coating process. Slat tracks are located on the leading edge of the wings and are used to guide the movement of panels known as slats. The panels provide additional lift during takeoff and landing. The FAA alleges Boeing knowingly submitted aircraft for final FAA airworthiness certification after determining that the parts could not be used after failing a strength test.",SPR,en,Benzinga Feeds
