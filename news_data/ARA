2019-07-27 07:45:00-05:00,Trump wants to reshape the $114 billion kidney-care market. Here are the 6 companies vying to benefit from the disruption.,"The Trump Administration recently announced plans to reshape how people get care for kidney disease by pushing for more people to get care at home, rather than in special centers. People whose kidneys don't work properly can undergo a treatment called dialysis to clean their blood. Currently, just 12% of patients get dialysis at home in the US. President Donald Trump issued an executive order on kidney care earlier this month. The administration aims to have 80% of patients with kidney failure either getting home-based care or receiving transplants by 2025. Right now, for-profit companies Fresenius Medical Care and DaVita control a large portion of the kidney-care market. They largely operate centers where people go three times a week to get dialysis. A slew of companies are seeking to disrupt the market by offering cheaper and more convenient care at home. They could benefit from Trump's executive order and related policies. CVS Health recently invested in a hemodialysis device, and Cricket Health, Outset Medical, and Somatus are trying to break into the market.",ARA,en,Business Insider

The goal is to encourage more home-based kidney care and to lower the burden on the Medicare budget. Medicare pays for most care for people with severe kidney disease. Around 37 million people in the US have kidney disease with 12% using home-based kidney care. The Trump administration wants to increase this number to 80% by 2025. Analysts at SVB Leerink, led by Ana Gupte, said that some big health insurers like CVS Health and UnitedHealth Group stand to benefit from the executive order. Click here for more BI Prime stories.
