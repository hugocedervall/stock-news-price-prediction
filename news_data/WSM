2020-11-13 20:00:00-05:00,Which Online Retailers Have The Lowest Prices,"Which Online Retailers Have The Lowest Prices Tyler Durden Fri, 11/13/2020 - 20:00 While over the past two decades, Amazon gradually became the world's largest online retailing monopoly by constantly undercutting its competitors on prices, resulting in deeply negative profit margins for years (offset by AWS), that changed in recent years when Amazon started flexing its monopoly muscles, gradually raising prices which it could do thanks to its dominant market position. As a result, when it comes to most prices in the electronics bucket, Amazon has some of the highest online prices now compared to such upstart online competitors as Walmart and Target , which are now in the unenviable position of having to undercut Amazon's prices to win market share. So is it indeed the case that Amazon's prices are now above its competitors? Not necessarily. This morning, Goldman published the takeaways from week 3 of its annual holiday pricing survey in which the bank captured the online prices of selected baskets of goods at WMT, TGT, AMZN, KR, ULTA, M, KSS, WSM, BBBY, JWN, DKS and Sephora as of November 10th.",WSM,en,Zero Hedge
