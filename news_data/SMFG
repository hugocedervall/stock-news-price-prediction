Vice-president and senior credit officer (financial institutions group) Eugene Tarzimanov said banks in these countries have the largest exposure to borrowers affected by changing oil prices in Asia. “Although they are better positioned against this crisis than during the previous downturn of 2014 to 2015 given their reduced exposure to such borrowers, the stress in the oil and gas industry is compounding asset risks for banks amid increased challenges in numerous other sectors affected by the coronavirus,” he said in a statement. Tarzimanov said Singaporean banks have extensively provisioned for exposures to the riskiest oil and gas companies, but risks still linger as evident by the default of major oil trading company Hin Leong Trading last month.",SMFG,en,The Sun Daily

Sources told Reuters that SoftBank's discussions with Mizuho, MUFG, and SMFG have stalled because lenders have hit internal lending limits to the firm.
