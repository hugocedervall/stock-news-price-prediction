That was about $200 million more than it lost in the second quarter. It made about $1 billion over the same period in 2019. It had cut its workforce by 22,000 employees since the end of 2019, leading to roughly $765 million in pretax costs in the third quarter, it said Wednesday. About 13,000 of these cuts were through furloughs, and 9,000 through voluntary departures. The Chicago-based airline said it cut operating costs by 59% in the third quarter, and had nearly $20 billion of liquidity to position it for an eventual recovery from the COVID-19 crisis that has hammered the travel industry. Airline executives have signaled a slow but steady improvement in leisure demand, but do not foresee a recovery to 2019 levels for at least two years, with business and international travel particularly slow to bounce back amid ongoing travel restrictions.

One week later, with the market below last Friday's lows, it appears that nobody knows what the correct answer is. So, to narrow down the confusion, Goldman's clients have shifted their attention to a just a more easily answerable question: will the buybacks that helped push the market to all time highs on increasingly less volume, still be there in the coming months?

But credit cards with annual fees often have great benefits like travel insurance, airport lounge access , no foreign transaction fees , free checked bags, and more.

In some cases, it can even be worth paying for a credit card with a high annual fee like the Platinum Card® from American Express if you can get value out of its benefits . Always consider the value of the benefits you are receiving and weigh them against the credit card's annual fee before deciding to ignore credit cards with annual fees.

2019-10-29 12:38:04-05:00,Boeing CEO knew about pilot’s warnings before 2nd crash,"A pilot warned the plane was “running rampant.”In November 2016, well before the 737 Max was certified by the Federal Aviation Administration, the plane’s chief technical pilot told a colleague that a new system on the plane was “running rampant” in simulator tests. The pilot, Mark Forkner, went on to say that he had unknowingly lied to regulators.In a January 2017 email, two months after acknowledging that he “unknowingly” lied to regulators, Forkner again pushed the FAA to remove mention of the system, known as MCAS, from pilot training materials.“Delete MCAS,” Forkner wrote. In aerospace speak, he described the system as “way outside the normal operating envelope,” meaning that it would only activate in rare situations that pilots would almost never encounter in normal passenger flights.But the instant messages to his colleague show that Forkner appeared to realize in November that MCAS was causing issues in the simulator and making it difficult to gain control of the plane.The messages, which were made public this month, raise serious new questions about what Boeing knew about the new system, known as MCAS, which played a role in both crashes.During the hearing before Congress, Muilenburg, Boeing’s chief executive, said that the company had not been able to speak to Forkner, who now works for Southwest Airlines, about the messages.However, when asked when he learned of the messages from Forkner, Muilenburg said: “I believe it was prior to the second crash.”Lawmakers also asked why Boeing, which has known about the messages for months, waited so long to hand the messages over to Congress and the FAA.“Boeing should have notified the FAA about that conversation upon its discovery immediately,” Sen.",LUV,en,The Economic Times India

2019-07-27 03:40:05-05:00,Latest 737 Max glitch found rooted in its software,"By Alan LevinAs U.S. government test pilots ran through dozens of flight scenarios on the Boeing Co. 737 Max in recent weeks, a potential failure got their attention.The plane’s flight computer tried to push the aircraft’s nose down repeatedly during a simulator run, prompted by a stream of erroneous flight data. The Federal Aviation Administration pilot concluded commercial pilots might not have time to react and avoid a tragedy in a real plane.That flaw -- the latest discovered on the family of jets involved in two fatal crashes since October triggered by a different failure that pushed their noses down -- was revealed by FAA last month. It threw new uncertainty on the return to flight of the Chicago-based company’s best-selling model and sent its engineers scrambling for a fix.Interviews with people familiar with the failure suggest it triggered multiple, aggressive movements to lower the plane’s nose, which alarmed the FAA pilots and other officials. However, the nose-down motion didn’t occur as a result of a computer hardware fault, according to one of the people, who asked not to be named because he wasn’t authorized to speak about the matter.That would add credibility to Boeing’s assertions that it can fix the issue with a relatively simple software change.“We are confident that is a software update, not a hardware update,” Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said during an earnings call on Wednesday. “It’s an understood update and we’re in the middle of working our way through that.”Muilenburg said the company expects it can complete a software patch by the end of September, while cautioning that the timeline remains uncertain.",LUV,en,The Economic Times India

2019-03-15 13:09:34-05:00,Boeing promised software fix last year too,"By Natalie Kitroeff, Jack Nicas and Thomas KaplanWeeks after a deadly crash involving a Boeing plane in October, company officials met separately with the pilot unions at Southwest Airlines and American Airlines. The officials said they planned to update the software for their 737 Max jets, the plane involved in the disaster, by around the end of 2018.It was the last time the Southwest pilots union heard from Boeing, and months later, the carriers are still waiting for a fix. After a second 737 Max crashed in Ethiopia, US regulators said the software update would be ready by April.“Boeing was going to have a software fix in the next five to six weeks,” said Michael Michaelis, the top safety official at the American Airlines pilots union and a Boeing 737 captain. “We told them, ‘Yeah, it can’t drag out.’ And well, here we are.”This delay is now part of the intense scrutiny over Boeing’s response after the first air disaster, a Lion Air accident that killed 189 people in Indonesia. The second crash, involving an Ethiopian Airlines flight that killed 157 people, bore similarities to the first, pointing to potential problems with the automated system that requires the update.The planned fix was “designed to detect the problem,” said Jon Weaks, the president of Southwest’s pilot union, “and keep it from recurring.” Boeing officials told Southwest union leaders that they didn’t believe any extra training was necessary beyond informing the pilots of how the software fix would function.The potential similarities between the two crashes were central to regulators’ decision to ground the whole 737 Max line, a family of planes that has been in service for nearly two years.",LUV,en,The Economic Times India

Curiously, this is a reversal of the conventional process where the rest of the world typically takes it cues from the FAA, long considered the world's gold standard for aircraft safety. Yet aviation safety regulators in dozens of other nations have decided not to wait for the FAA to act and have grounded the planes or banned them from their airspace. In addition, at least 10 airlines worldwide have stopped flying them. The Ethiopian disaster followed the deadly crash in October of another new Boeing 737 Max 8 operated by Lion Air in the sea off Indonesia. As we reported yesterday, the EU's Aviation Safety Agency, which covers 32 countries, announced Tuesday it was banning the planes from flying in its airspace. Other countries that have either grounded or temporarily banned them include China, the United Kingdom, India, Indonesia, Singapore, Oman, Malaysia, Vietnam, Australia and the UAE.",LUV,en,Zero Hedge

2019-03-12 17:41:58-05:00,Pilots Complained About Boeing 737 Max 8 For Months Before Second Deadly Crash,"Several Pilots repeatedly warned federal authorities of safety concerns over the now-grounded Boeing 737 Max 8, according to an investigation by the Dallas Morning News . One captain even called the plane's flight manual ""inadequate and almost criminally insufficient,"" according to the report. ""The fact that this airplane requires such jury-rigging to fly is a red flag. Now we know the systems employed are error-prone — even if the pilots aren't sure what those systems are, what redundancies are in place and failure modes. I am left to wonder: what else don't I know?"" wrote the captain. At least five complaints about the Boeing jet were found in a federal database which pilots routinely use to report aviation incidents without fear of repercussions. The complaints are about the safety mechanism cited in preliminary reports for an October plane crash in Indonesia that killed 189. The disclosures found by The News reference problems during flights of Boeing 737 Max 8s with an autopilot system during takeoff and nose-down situations while trying to gain altitude.",LUV,en,Zero Hedge

Australia’s Civil Aviation Safety Authority said on Tuesday that it had suspended the operation of all Boeing 737 MAX aircraft flying to or from the country. Since no Australian airlines fly the aircraft (though its Virgin Air recently ordered dozens of new MAX 8s), the decision only impacts the Singaporean airlines SilkAir and Fiji Airlines, according to the FT. “This is a temporary suspension while we wait for more information to review the safety risks of continued operations of the Boeing 737 MAX,"" said CASA' chief executive and director of aviation safety, Shane Carmody, in a statement to the Sydney Morning Herald. Meanwhile, Virgin Australia has 40 MAX aircraft on order, and said it was ""closely watching the situation"", and hinted that it could change its order depending on the outcome of the investigation. ""With our first aircraft delivery not due until November this year, we believe there is sufficient time to consider the outcome of the investigation and make an assessment,"" a Virgin spokeswoman said.",LUV,en,Zero Hedge

Buffett continued to bid up bank shares, making his Omaha-based firm a major shareholder in four of the five largest US banks. This includes increasing stakes in JP Morgan and Bank of America during the last three months of the year. Buffett also boosted his stakes in regional lenders like PNC Financial Services Group and US Bancorp which may have been plays on consolidation in the industry (a trend that is starting to play out following the recent BB&T-Suntrust deal ).

Worse , breweries can’t sell new beer while they’re waiting for approval of new labels.

Longtime congressional budget aide Stan Collender stated: ""The impact will multiply as the days and weeks continue"". Friday marked the 14th day of the shutdown that is the consequence of President Trump not getting the funds he needs for his border wall.
