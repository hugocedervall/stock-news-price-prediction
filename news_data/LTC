Several factors have fuelled this year’s digital currency surge - from the shifting macroeconomic backdrop since the Q1 coronavirus crash to an investor community gradually becoming more comfortable with cryptocurrency’s infrastructure. The low-to-negative interest rate environment has led many allocators to see bitcoin – which has soared some 170 per cent this year - almost as a ‘gold version 2.0’ proxy, in contrast with overpriced equities. “Since Covid-19, there has been a huge amount of money printing by central banks, which has flagged up macro implications, and that has very much brought the ‘digital gold’ narrative of bitcoin to the fore – not just within the crypto space but to the mainstream,” says Peter Habermacher, CEO at London-based Aaro Capital, a digital ledger technology, blockchain and cryptoasset multi-manager specialist.",LTC,en,Hedgeweek

This is significant because the all-time high for the cryptocurrency is $19,783 back in December of 2017, only to drop down to as low as $3,122. Within the past year, the price of Bitcoin has more than doubled, posting close to $10,000 in growth in the last two months alone. As Ethan Yang writes at The American Institute for Economic Research , with most of the news attention on Covid-19, the presidential election, and so on, it is understandable that the meteoric rise of Bitcoin may have slipped past casual observers as it did not receive the attention it received in 2017. However, what makes this rapid growth interesting is that there are a number of important circumstances that might be paving the way for Bitcoin to sustain its ongoing trend.",LTC,en,Zero Hedge

Cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift recently delisted three privacy coins: Dash , Zcash ( ZEC ) and Monero ( XMR ). This was an unexpected move to say the least, given the exchange’s historic commitment to privacy. As a noncustodial platform, Shapeshift did not impose user identification requirements on traders in its early days, although this began to change with the gradual introduction of a mandatory membership model, compliant with Know Your Customer rules, as of 2018. Why then, did it move to delist Dash, Zcash and Monero, even as other exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken and Binance.US still list these coins? In a statement shared with Cointelegraph, the chief financial officer of Dash Core Group, Glenn Austin, said he found the delisting “particularly frustrating because [it] could have been entirely avoided by a simple 10–15 minute call.” Austin believes the delisting boils down to “an educational issue.” While the reasons for the delisting have not been officially clarified, Austin has speculated that the move may be influenced by the currency having been mentioned twice in the Department of Justice’s recently published “Cryptocurrency Enforcement Framework.” In both cases, Dash was cited alongside Monero and Zcash as an example of an anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrency.",LTC,en,Cointelegraph

Both political parties in the US have substantive but diametrically opposite ideologies and policies to run economic affairs, which the markets are waiting to discount.In any case, there are fears that the election this time around may bring with it a prolonged litigation over the balloting system.

By this year-end, the domestic bourses are unlikely to witness fresh highs and a strong bout of profit booking may emerge instead.

En cuanto al precio, Litecoin (LTC) ha tenido un año bastante duro y actualmente la altcoin ha bajado un 51% en los últimos doce meses.

Las incertidumbres con respecto al futuro de Litecoin han causado que los inversores pierdan interés en el proyecto y esto se refleja tanto en la cadena como en las métricas comerciales de LTC.Lo interesante es que, aunque la mayoría consideraría el desinterés de los inversores como un factor negativo, algunos han estado acumulando silenciosamente LTC.El fundador de Litecoin, Charlie Lee, habla sobre los rumores de abandono del proyectoEl volumen de comercio de Litecoin cae a un mínimo de 2 añosEl volumen es el indicador más relevante del interés de los traders y Litecoin ha fallado miserablemente en esta área.",LTC,es,Blockboard News

The Ethereum team has been trying to solve the blockchain scalability problem since 2014. During that time, solutions such as Raiden, Plasma, zk-SNARKs, sharding and rollups appeared in the developers’ tool kit. However, the implementation of some of them was constantly delayed, while others proved to be of limited efficacy. This was the issue until Ethereum’s Istanbul hard fork was implemented in December 2019, which gave hope that the network can finally become suitable for corporate use. Cointelegraph attempted to figure out whether the situation with the second-largest cryptocurrency’s scalability has changed and why not all the solutions have cut the mustard. Why should Ethereum scale? The Ethereum ( ETH ) blockchain has become a software for thousands of projects over the past couple of years. Its easy-to-use smart contract model allows for the creation of almost any application and a release of the project’s own cryptocurrency.",LTC,en,Cointelegraph

Please keep in mind that our discussion here is introductory and merely educational. Coinbase doesn’t provide investment advice, and this article shouldn’t viewed as investment advice. Always make your own independent assessment of whether any particular investment or investment strategy is right for you, your risk tolerance, and financial means, before entering into a transaction.

Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have experienced price volatility in the past with values swinging double-digit percentage points in a single day — and sometimes even in a single hour.

And not just hackers and crooks, even companies and market researchers may be buying this data. The cost of a set of such data? As little as Rs 140 a day.The dark web, as it is called, is not accessible through regular browsers. Only tools like Tor, an open source software that allows anonymous communication, allow access to the dark web. And in this hidden part of the web, hackers are putting together internet user details that include passwords, telephone numbers and email IDs.Among those looking for such data are outfits planning cyberattacks, those keen to track consumer behaviour and those who simply want to get free access to video streaming sites that you have paid for, say experts.69381993 More interestingly and worringly, such data sets are being bought by companies looking for information on competitors’ consumer base, and even for potentially tracking key executives of rival firms who may have sensitive and crucial data.While one group of hackers leaks the data with encrypted passwords, a second group decrypts them. “What is happening now is that a third group makes a list of these decrypted passwords and stores them in a central server that provides data sets from these breaches, making it a common source for hackers,” says Rajshekhar Rajaharia, an independent cybersecurity researcher.Using Single Password Makes You VulnerableYou are particularly vulnerable if you use a single password for multiple online accounts, or have passwords that are only slightly different.",LTC,en,The Economic Times India
