Shares of the toymaker slid in early trading Friday. Hasbro's largest-ever deal would expand its audience and boost earnings. Watch Hasbro trade live on Markets Insider. Hasbro investors aren't sure about Peppa Pig. Shares of the largest public toymaker slid more than 7% in early trading Friday after the company announced Thursday that it would purchase Entertainment One for $4 billion. Entertainment One produces content for adults and children — its lineup includes Peppa Pig, PJ Masks, and Ricky Zoom, three popular cartoon franchises for infants and toddlers. Entertainment One's stock price rose to as high as £5.79 in London trading, topping the £5.60 price tag that Hasbro offered and fueling speculation that another company could make a competing bid, according to Bloomberg. If the deal goes through, it would expand Hasbro's portfolio to new, younger viewers. Other brands that Hasbro owns include Monopoly, Transformers, and My Little Pony. ""Peppa Pig, PJ Masks and other brands in development are highly profitable and merchandisable,"" said Brian Goldner, the CEO of Hasbro, on a call with analysts. ""These brands have many of the characteristics and profitability of our franchise brands."" The acquisition could help boost Hasbro's earnings, writes Theron Mohammed of Business Insider .",ETO,en,Business Insider
