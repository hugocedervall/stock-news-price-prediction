Despite the retreat, PublicInvest Research believes that their valuations will continue to expand as the absence of a vaccine might lead to the coronavirus being spread to more countries. “We raise our price-to-earnings valua-tion for Top Glove, Hartalega and Kossan to 43 times, 48 times and 29 times respectively. We also raise our earnings forecast for glove makers under our coverage universe in FY20-FY21 by 3-5% to account for the possible extra orders from China that, in our view, will materialise. We also see slight margin expansion resulting from better bargaining power in the hands of the glove manufacturers,” it said in a research note today. It has also upgraded the rubber glove sector from “neutral” to “overweight”. On Bursa Malaysia today, Hartalega Holdings Bhd fell 21 sen or 3.36% to RM6.04, Top Glove Corp Bhd sank 16 sen or 2.67% to RM5.84, Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd slipped 11 sen or 2.2% to RM4.90, while Supermax Corp Bhd was down 8 sen or 4.3% to RM1.78.",SD,en,The Sun Daily
