First there was a historic sell-off, then came the stunning rally, and now it's been followed by an ultra-fast drop led by falling tech stocks . In just three days of trading between September 3 and September 8, the Nasdaq Composite slumped 10%, its fastest correction ever. Downturns in stocks are normal, although the speed of this one was unusual, and nothing about recent circumstances has been normal anyway. Andrew Slimmon, a senior portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management who advises on the firm's long-equity strategies, says there's good news for investors who've been shaken up by the events of early September: The slump isn't a sign of impending disaster. ""The tech stocks and growth stocks are oversold,"" Slimmon told Business Insider in an exclusive interview. ""I don't see the big mega-cap tech stocks as outrageously expensive. So I think you want to hold position in those stocks now."" But even though he doesn't see signs of a ruinous tech bubble, he says many cloud computing and work from home companies have already priced in a huge amount of good news.",STOR,en,Business Insider
