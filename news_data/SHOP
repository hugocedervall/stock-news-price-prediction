Many SMBs are on the brink of closing permanently in the wake of the pandemic. The crisis forced many to temporarily close and has caused drops in demand as consumers deal with financial difficulties and follow social distancing guidelines. The sudden drop in earnings, which may continue if pandemic conditions don't improve soon, could lead to wide-scale small-business closures in the coming months, and medium-sized businesses may be facing similar risks since the prolonged nature of the crisis is likely cutting into any additional resources and funds they have access to. By helping SMBs survive the crisis, point-of-sale (POS) solution providers will preserve their client bases and strengthen their appeal to prospective customers. Many SMBs already had some form of POS system in order to accept payments. But now they may also need tools that help them digitize their business, adjust their operations, and trim their costs for post-pandemic survival.",SHOP,en,Business Insider

Payments firms have introduced buy buttons to streamline the online checkout process, but so many have done so that it can have the opposite effect. This led companies to introduce buy buttons so consumers could skip the cumbersome, labor-intensive steps required to input contact and payment information online, and to allow them to shop online more freely.

Prime Day also seems to have driven ample first-party sales for Amazon: The Echo Dot was the most popular product purchased globally and the etailer sold millions of Alexa-compatible devices. But bringing in sales for third-party sellers, specifically small businesses, was clearly a focus for the firm this year since it invested $100 million to help small businesses for Prime Day and ran a promotion that gave consumers a credit if they bought from smaller sellers. Driving sales for smaller merchants could have helped Amazon fend off retailers that tried to compete for sales during Prime Day.

The $20 billion hedge fund that Gaonkar helps manage is known as one of the premier growth investors in the world, and its biggest holdings include names like Amazon, Paypal, Shopify, Facebook, and Microsoft. But those holdings shouldn't be thought of as only growth bets, Gaonkar said, when asked by the moderator about value's outlook. For instance, where Facebook is trading verses where ""packaged goods companies"" are trading doesn't give Gaonkar much incentive to invest in the latter, even if they are considered more traditional value stocks. ""We look at value in the sense of what is the best risk-reward vs. growth, and from that perspective. The traditional hunting grounds of just saying ok let's look at set P/E multiples and set cyclicals is a little dangerous,"" she said.

Many SMBs are on the brink of closing permanently in the wake of the pandemic. The crisis forced many to temporarily close and has caused drops in demand as consumers deal with financial difficulties and follow social distancing guidelines. The sudden drop in earnings, which may continue if pandemic conditions don't improve soon, could lead to wide-scale small-business closures in the coming months, and medium-sized businesses may be facing similar risks since the prolonged nature of the crisis is likely cutting into any additional resources and funds they have access to. By helping SMBs survive the crisis, point-of-sale (POS) solution providers will preserve their client bases and strengthen their appeal to prospective customers.

He says, “The interest really shot up. I’ve had 1000s of people asking for it, and we fielded like 350 requests in one day. Also, some of these want it for cheap.” As low as $500 (~ ₹40,000) which some of his rivals offer. “A good TikTok clone app starts at around $8000 (~ ₹6 lakh) and goes as high as $25000 (~ ₹19 lakh) depending on the features they want — live-streaming, social commerce etc,” Sharma adds.The broad categories of interested parties in these TikTok clones include news media outlets which want to offer quick, bite-sized content in short video form, subscription-based content products (Onlyfans model), edtech companies which see potential in short video for education content, celebrity management companies which want to monetise the captive market of existing clients, and “wannapreneurs” — entrepreneurs who want to ride the opportunity of a short video by quickly building a “me too TikTok” product to fill the market gap.These entrepreneurs, typically, are on the lookout for clones for two reasons — first, to save cost and time in building their own product and two, get access to instant scalability, given that these apps, “emulate business models.” Other companies in the space include the Chennai-based AppDupe and Jaipur-based UI Slick.",SHOP,en,Economic Times India

Beginning in September 2019, total assets started to increase.” Directly below this note is the following chart: Does this look like a balance sheet that expands and contracts over time?

La Asociación detrás del proyecto de ‘stablecoin’ ha anunciado este jueves cambios a su definición, especificando que, a parte de la moneda ‘multidivisa’ de la que lleva hablando desde el año pasado, Libra ofrecerá también monedas vinculadas a una divisa fiduciaria de forma individual. Es decir, a parte de una libra global con varias divisas dentro, habrá también libras vinculadas solo a una divisa cada una. Además, en declaraciones a El Confidencial, el director general y COO de la Asociación, Bertrand Perez, ha confirmado que la fecha de lanzamiento se espera ahora para “finales de 2020” – cuando la fecha inicial anunciada en 2019 había sido junio de este año . Esta decisión se enmarca dentro del diálogo de Libra con los distintos reguladores. “Mientras que nuestra visión siempre había sido que la red de Libra complementase a las divisas fiduciarias, no que compitiese con ellas, una de las preocupaciones cruciales que se nos ha transmitido ha sido el potencial de que la Libra interfiriese con la soberanía monetaria y política monetaria si la red llegase a una escala significativa y un gran volumen de pagos domésticos se hiciesen en Libras”, explican en el nuevo documento.

""Small businesses don't have a lot of time, and we want to step them through all the growth that's available on the web,"" said Kim Spalding, global product director of small business ads at Google.
