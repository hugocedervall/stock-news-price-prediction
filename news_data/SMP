Unfortunately, it’s likely many individual investors missed out on a large portion of those gains. The Numbers A recent study by DALBAR found that individual investors averaged a 3.69% annual return over a 30-year period in which the S&P 500 averaged 11.1% returns annually. A similar study by Morningstar found that individual investors averaged a 6.1% return over a 10-year stretch, while passive mutual funds averaged 7% returns over the same period. In 2018, active fund managers — professional managers that often manage millions or billions of dollars — underperformed the S&P 500 for the ninth consecutive year. S&P Dow Jones Indices found that a whopping 92% of stock-picking managers have underperformed the S&P over the past 15 years. Why Are Investors Missing Out?
