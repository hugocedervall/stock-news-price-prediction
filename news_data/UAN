The company had moved a division bench seeking to quash a criminal complaint filed against it by the EPFO for not furnishing the details.Companies such as JP Morgan and Oracle have been sending reminders to employees to link Aadhaar numbers with their PF accounts, said employees at these firms.",UAN,en,The Economic Times India
