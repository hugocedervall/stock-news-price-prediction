The report, entitled Deep Trouble , reveals how arms manufacturers and mining companies in the Europe and North America are dominating a nascent but rapidly-growing market for deep sea exploration, noting that an area the size of France and Germany in the Pacific Ocean has now been licensed by the industry regulator, the International Seabed Authority (ISA). This includes large swathes of the seabed reserved for developing Pacific island nations, according to the findings. Companies are permitted to apply for ISA contracts to explore and exploit deep sea minerals if they are sponsored by governments that have ratified the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).",LMT,en,BusinessGreen

The BE-7 engine, which Blue Origin has been developing for years, has tallied 1,245 seconds of test-fire time and will power the company’s National Team Human Landing System lunar lander. Blue Origin leads a “national team” as the prime contractor that it assembled in 2019 to help build its Blue Moon lander. That team includes Lockheed Martin Corp, Northrop Grumman Corp and Draper. Blue Origin has vied for lucrative government contracts in recent years and is competing with rival billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Dynetics, owned by Leidos Holdings Inc, to win a contract to build NASA’s next human lunar landing system to ferry humans to the moon in the next decade.",LMT,en,Novinite

The flight test of the hypersonic engine was conducted in a wind tunnel in Beijing suggested unprecedented thrust, fuel efficiency, and operational stability. Scientists believe the engine could operate at Mach 16, propelling an airframe across the world in just two hours. The Chinese paper, titled ""The criteria for airbreathing hypersonic propulsion and its experimental verification,"" says the sodramjet (short for ""standing oblique detonation ramjet engine"") is an ""airbreathing propulsion"" system ""for future aerospace flight."" It has no moving parts and uses the plane's speed to ram air into the engine, then blended with hydrogen fuel and detonated, discharging out of the back of the engine as thrust.

2019-12-30 05:00:12-05:00,5 Tangible Advances for Long Duration Energy Storage in 2019,"Following long duration storage is like rooting for a home team that’s always about to win next year. Lithium-ion batteries utterly dominate grid storage deployments these days. That’s great for the cost decline narrative, in the way that cheap Chinese photovoltaic cells produced a massive expansion in solar deployments. But cost obsession results in technology lock-in, boxing out other tools that could prove useful or even better if given the time and space to grow. It also makes for homogeneous storylines: In other news, the latest energy storage plant looks and performs exactly like all the other ones; check back as this story develops. There are good reasons to root for the scrappy upstarts challenging the conventional wisdom and building alternative technologies to store clean energy for days, as will be needed for highly renewable grids. But the last decade has seen the long duration storage field make outlandish promises and instead deliver bankruptcies or a slow-rolled smattering of small demos.",LMT,en,Green Technology
2019-12-28 12:30:00-05:00,What the new decade will bring for warfare,"In the coming decade, what we know as speed and distance is expected to change entirely. Hypersonic technology may see people travelling from Delhi to New York faster than it takes to cover a 50 km road trip around Delhi NCR today. The progress in hypersonic technology, letting systems travel beyond five times the speed of sound (1,235 km per hour), will also usher in new types of weapons with the capability to strike targets almost anywhere in the world within minutes.Military use will precede travel or other such safe applications as getting hypersonic vehicles to transport humans is currently too complex. If the technology falls into the wrong hands, it would be akin to unleashing Darth Vader on steroids on the world, with the power to hold millions of people as hostage.For, hypersonics are as much about advancements in technology as about the military might of nations. The United States leads research and development in this field, closely followed by China and Russia. Australia, Japan and the European Union also have civilian and military hypersonic research projects.India’s Defence Research & Development Organisation has also started work on hypersonics to develop missiles that can travel five times the speed of sound or a little over a mile every second.The hypersonic missiles being tested in the West are 5-10-ft-long, weigh about 250 kg and are encased in ceramic coating, carbon fibre composites or nickel-chromium super alloys.Working as hyper-fast power drills, these missiles can smash or penetrate any target almost undetected by present-day radar systems.",LMT,en,The Economic Times India

It's the latest moment wherein Turkey's president has lashed out at Washington, and comes amidst tensions over the United States objecting to Russian S-400 anti-air defense systems being transferred to Turkey. Of that contentious debate, for which the US has held up delivery of F-35 stealth jets purchased previously by Turkey, Erdogan said emphatically, ""this is over"" . He affirmed the Russian deal had already been inked with the first delivery expected in July. ""We are an independent Turkey, we are not slaves,"" he said to Turkish broadcaster Kanal 24 .

After several decades of testing and development, the service announced Thursday that the fifth-generation fighter had achieved Initial Operating Capability, indicating that it has passed all tests to be flown on combat missions. Thursday's announcement came after a squadron of the F-35Cs qualified and deployed with the San Diego-based Nimitz-class supercarrier, Carl Vinson. “The F-35C is ready for operations, ready for combat and ready to win,” said Commander Naval Air Forces, Vice Admiral DeWolfe Miller. “We are adding an incredible weapon system into the arsenal of our Carrier Strike Groups that significantly enhances the capability of the joint force.” Lockheed Martin, one of the Pentagon's top defense suppliers, designed three variants of the plane: the F-35A for the Air Force, F-35B for the Marine Corps, and F-35C for the Navy. ""We congratulate the Department of the Navy on achieving Initial Operational Capability with its fleet of F-35Cs,"" Greg Ulmer, Lockheed Martin vice president and general manager of the F-35 program, said in a statement.

Amidst the Pastor Andrew Brunson detention affair which drew widespread media attention last summer Congressional leaders demanded that the over 100 Lockheed Martin-made F-35 stealth jets purchased by Turkey be blocked from delivery.

Yilmaz's transfer caught US officials ""completely by surprise"" especially as he had been sought by US authorities for over a decade in connection with charges that he conducted attacks on American troops along the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan starting in around 2005 .
