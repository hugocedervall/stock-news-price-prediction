2020-11-10 14:43:27-05:00,Occidental Is Top U.S. Oil Driller to Embrace Emissions Goal,"(Bloomberg) -- Occidental Petroleum Corp. became the biggest U.S. oil explorer to target net zero emissions from everything it extracts and sells, accelerating an industry trend that’s become commonplace in Europe.The Houston-based company plans to reach net zero emissions from its own operations by 2040 and from customer usage of its products by 2050, Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub said during a conference call with analysts on Tuesday. The plan relies heavily on capturing carbon dioxide and burying it, a technology that’s so far been prohibitively expensive.The announcement comes weeks after U.S. rival ConocoPhillips unveiled plans to curb climate-damaging pollution from its operations but didn’t address emissions generated by customers. The latter account for about 80% of the total emissions bill from a barrel of crude.American oil producers have been hesitant to adopt the sort of aggressive climate goals of European peers, in part because it would require a pivot away from the shale revolution that made U.S. oil production relevant again in global markets.Occidental’s announcement is significant because the company has one of the biggest footprints in the Permian Basin, the sprawling oil field beneath Texas and New Mexico that produces more crude than any other region on the continent.",OXY,en,Yahoo Finance

Following his lackluster performance during this year's annual shareholder meeting, where Buffett reported a historic loss for Berkshire Hathaway, while affirming that it's massive cash pile had grown to $137 billion . More recently, Wall Street analysts who cover the company have started to wonder: Did Berkshire sit out the entire rally?

Der Leitindex Dow Jones Industrial stieg um 1,70 Prozent auf 27.572,44 Punkte. Das war der höchste Stand seit Ende Februar. Die Kurse legten auf breiter Front zu, die größten Gewinner waren Papiere aus dem Energiesektor und die von Versorgern. In der vergangenen Woche war das weltweit bekannteste Börsenbarometer um insgesamt knapp 7 Prozent nach oben geschnellt und hatte den Anlegern einen bärenstarken Juni-Auftakt beschert. Die Zahl neuer Infektionen mit dem Coronavirus entwickele sich verhalten, begründete Analyst Chris Hussey von Goldman Sachs die fortgesetzten Kursgewinne. Gleichzeitig gebe es für die Unternehmen große geldpolitische und fiskalische Anreize. Die Wirtschaft dürfte sich daher «auf einem guten Weg der Erholung befinden».

I had become a capitalist, and it felt good.""Since taking control of Berkshire Hathaway in 1965, Buffett has marshalled the company to an annual average gain of 20.5 percent, more than double the average advance of the S&P 500.Berkshire's market value is now around $530 billion.The success comes not only from Buffett's investments in other publicly-traded companies but also from an assortment of holdings of profitable companies in a range of sectors, including insurance, freight rail transportation and electric utilities.But Buffett is an enterprising stock picker and his quarterly list of holdings is closely watched by other investors.""Most portfolio managers would be considered successful when they are right 70% of the time.",OXY,en,The Economic Times India

But Berkshire also has stakes in life and health insurance coverage as well as reinsurance.The multi-billionaire describes this business line as Berkshire Hathaway's growth engine, allowing the company to invest policyholder premiums and pay out claims as needed.The BNSF Railway Company includes nearly 400 companies acquired over 160 years.",OXY,en,The Economic Times India
