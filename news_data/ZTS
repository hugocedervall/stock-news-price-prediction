But today, there are entire bakeries dedicated to making dog-friendly cakes, cookies, and other confection for the best boys and girls. Americans are loving their pets more than ever. And as they continue to play a bigger role in our lives, the petcare industry is also growing alongside it. Kristen Peck, the CEO of animal vaccine and medication company Zoetis, explained at the Business Insider Global Trends Festival , that the importance of our pets today is part of an evolution that's taken place over the last three decades. ""Maybe 30 years ago, pets were in someone's backyard,"" Peck said. ""Then they came into the house. And I'd say five-to-10 years ago they ended up on your bed. Why does that matter? The closer they get to you, the more you invest in their healthcare, and the more their health impacts you.""

2020-10-20 18:32:44-05:00,Common signs of coronavirus in children to watch out for,"Children can be infected with COVID-19, just like adults, albeit not at the same rate or to the same degree -- and, moreover, they don't necessarily present the same coronavirus symptoms, either. A team of UK researchers is out with the results of a new study running through a list of some of the most common COVID-19 symptoms reported in children who were symptomatic for the virus. The team's study also walks through ways to differentiate COVID-19 and the common cold in children. The CDC said in recent days that a coronavirus vaccine may not be recommended for children at first, guidance that seems related to the fact that most of the drugmakers working on a vaccine have only been testing it on adults. ""However, clinical trials continue to expand those recruited to participate,"" the CDC notes, hinting that the trials could encompass children down the line. However, immunologist Sallie Permar, MD, PhD, recently told the Association of American Medical Colleges that “A pediatric vaccine would not only help children -- it will be the basis of eventually eliminating COVID-19 in our population."" Which is the same reason that the American Association of Pediatrics penned a letter this month to the Food and Drug Administration , which includes the following: “It is counter to the ethical principle of distributive justice to allow children to take on great burdens during this pandemic but not have the opportunity to benefit from a vaccine … because they have not been included in vaccine trials."" For now, knowing the coronavirus symptoms that can present themselves in children will be the key to keeping young people safe.",ZTS,en,BGR

It starts out as a wrenchingly painful human drama. But having clumsily invoked the most intimate of family tragedies, it lurches into a preposterous melodrama from a Huxley-esque dystopia. The setting is the present or near-future (some tech innovations tip you off) and Delpy plays Isabelle, a French scientist living in Berlin with her six-year-old daughter Zoe (Sophia Ally), whose custody arrangements she is negotiating with her angry British ex-husband James (Richard Armitage).

The results, published in Nature Medicine and abstracts shared at the American Society of Nutrition show a wide range of inflammation responses after eating, even amongst apparently healthy people. Dietary inflammation is linked with increased risk for conditions such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity. The study suggests improved weight management and health could be achieved by eating food that are personalized to reduce dietary inflammation. ZOE will launch a new test kit and app in July that uses AI to develop personalized eating plans based on a person's unique gut microbes and dietary inflammation. They have launched today a waitlist for customers eager to access the new kit.

The following week - ending May 30 - practice sales were up by a slightly slower pace of approximately 9%. The firm suggested this ""normalization from the prior week could indicate pent-up demand for care (from previously postponed or canceled visits) is now being cleared"".

Animal Pharm's industry rankings stretch back to 1990. In these three decades, the animal health industry has seen many major names come and go. Animal Pharm editor Joseph Harvey dips into the archives to highlight some trends. Naturally, the animal health industry league tables from 1990 and 2000 are unrecognizable compared to the current standings. Not only are the names of the companies very different but also the levels of annual revenues. In 1990, the animal health market was worth only $9.9 billion globally. There were no billion-dollar businesses in the industry and only around $700 million separated the whole of top 20. All the companies in the 1990 rankings, aside from BASF, were part of larger human pharmaceutical groups - something that can be attributed to only three companies in the most recent standings from fiscal 2019.

Sometimes celebrities have caused a lot of controversy with their trademark applications, with many accusing stars of appropriating a culture, stealing someone else's phrase, or trying to get the rights to something that's far too common. Kim Kardashian recently received backlash for attempting to trademark ""Kimono,"" the name of her new shapewear line and also the moniker of a traditional Japanese garment. Visit INSIDER's homepage for more great stories. From catchphrases to pet names, celebrities have tried to trademark a lot of different things over the years. In simple terms, trademarks are a legal way to ensure other people can't profit off of your original idea or phrase, though the rules for what can and cannot be trademarked are not exactly clear-cut and simple. Most of the time, they apply to specific goods — for famous individuals, trademarks oftentimes prevent people from selling faux merchandise, like phone cases or T-shirts, with lyrics, catchphrases, or names tied to specific celebrities.",ZTS,en,Business Insider

Lead researcher Tim Spector said a good general rule is still to eat a variety of plants, including nuts, seeds, fruits, and vegetables, while incorporating some fermented foods into your diet. The researchers behind this study are developing a personalized nutrition company called Zoe. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. There are many different ways to eat, and plenty of people who will tell you that their plan is the best way to stay fit. But a new study is calling their bluff. Scientists had 1,100 adults in the US and UK eat the same common foods (like muffins for breakfast and sandwiches for lunch), and tracked participants' glucose levels before and after meals. The results showed that no two individuals' reactions were the same — more evidence that there's no such thing as a perfect, one-size-fits-all diet. ""Even we were surprised by the results,"" Tim Spector , an epidemiologist and professor at King's College in London who led the study , told Business Insider. ""Just because some diet or recommendation is out there doesn't mean that you fit it."" The findings back up other recent work that undermines the conventional ""eat this, not that"" wisdom about dieting.
