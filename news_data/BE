2020-12-03 14:28:21-05:00,Trump and his allies have won zero out at least 32 lawsuits they've filed since Election Day,"Summary List Placement Faced with the prospect of losing to a man he spent months hammering as corrupt, doddering, and mentally deficient, President Donald Trump is going on offense, spreading lies and conspiracy theories about a ""rigged"" election marred by ""major fraud"" from Democrats. He's alternated between demanding that some states stop counting ballots, which he doesn't have the power to do, and saying that others should keep counting , which they were doing anyway. To that end, the Trump campaign and other Republican groups have mounted at least 26 legal challenges since Election Day. They've won zero. The lawsuits argue that states and counties have violated election laws, playing into Trump's political strategy to discredit the results of the 2020 election that President-elect Joe Biden won. Republicans have filed the lawsuits in local, state, and federal courts in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, and Pennsylvania — all states that Biden won or is projected to win, according to Decision Desk HQ data published by Insider .",BE,en,Business Insider
2020-12-02 07:51:39.440000-05:00,RBI expected to maintain rates on elevated inflation levels: Brickwork Ratings,"New Delhi: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to maintain a rate pause in the upcoming Monetary Policy Committee meet, considering elevated inflation levels, Brickwork Ratings said on Wednesday. As per the agency, to support economic activity, which was severely disrupted since March, the RBI is likely to continue with its accommodative stance; however, it is unlikely to reduce the repo rate in the December policy meeting, considering CPI inflation remains elevated. Lately, CPI inflation has remained above the RBI MPC's median target of 4 per cent for the last 13 months and in October 2020, the inflation rate touched 7.61 per cent, the highest since May 2014, largely due to the high rate of food inflation. ""Price pressures are likely to be transient and are expected to ease gradually in the coming months if the economy normalises,"" the agency said. ""However, the current level of CPI inflation is uncomfortably higher than the MPC's upper bound of 6 per cent while demand conditions in the economy continue to remain tepid and real interest rates are mostly in the negative zone."" Since March 2020, the RBI has reduced the repo rate by 115 points cumulatively and brought it down to 4 per cent in the May policy meeting.",BE,en,Sify.com
2020-11-28 10:30:00-05:00,U.S. And German Yields Will Bear Brunt Of Lockdowns,"U.S. And German Yields Will Bear Brunt Of Lockdowns Tyler Durden Sat, 11/28/2020 - 10:30 By Richard Jones, macro commentator at Bloomberg Increased pandemic restrictions will serve as a massive economic drag in Europe and the U.S. in the coming months, leading to material downside for bund and Treasury yields. Stocks have rallied this month on vaccine optimism and reduced U.S. political uncertainty. Yet bonds’ reaction on both sides of the Atlantic have been much more circumspect. While the Stoxx 600 and S&P 500 have posted double digit percentage gains, the 10-year UST yield is unchanged and the corresponding bund yield is only 5bps higher, suggesting virus concerns are more in play. By year-end, given existing partial lockdowns, the 10-year German yield can revisit the -0.67% low seen on Nov. 4. The 10-year UST can trade back down to 0.72%, the Nov. 5 low. The pandemic is worsening in the U.S. and Europe, and the resulting economic drag will become more evident in the coming weeks and months.",BE,en,Zero Hedge

The Silicon Valley-based firm is working to disrupt the global spirits industry, which experts at business analysis firm MarketLine say could be worth more than $800 billion globally by 2022. In order to acquire their distinct flavors, spirits like rum or whisky usually have to be matured in sealed barrels for months or years at a time. But Bespoken Spirits says its technology can reproduce the same taste in a matter of days. ""The traditional spirits production process is outdated, imprecise, unpredictable, unsustainable, and inefficient,"" said Janousek, a material scientist and former exec at Bloom Energy. ""The barrel aging process costs billions of dollars in lost product and limits ability to pivot along with consumer tastes and demands,"" he added.

But don’t be confused. Like a swimming duck, a lot has been happening with microgrids under the surface. New third-party financing options for microgrids in which the energy offtaker does not own or maintain the asset — known as energy-as-a-service (EaaS) or microgrids-as-a-service (MaaS) — are making microgrids accessible to small businesses with small energy loads, according to a new report from Wood Mackenzie . While not a new structure (EaaS has been around for the better part of a decade), the research shows the market is maturing. Increasingly, financers are investing in small-scale microgrids that are less than 5 megawatts, a size better suited for on-site power generation for, say, medium to large commercial buildings or a mid-sized industrial facility.",BE,en,GreenBiz

Zac Estrada Tue, 08/18/2020 - 01:00 In the race to drastically cut emissions in shipping, one of the industry's biggest names, Samsung Heavy Industries, is teaming with fuel cell company Bloom Energy to develop a more sustainable fuel designed to meet steep international targets. Under the partnership, announced in June, the companies will collaborate on creating fuel cell powertrains for commercial ships, potentially providing one critical path to a clean technology future for marine shipping. The goal is to replace oil-based power generation. Samsung is one of the largest shipbuilders in South Korea, along with the Hyundai Group and the Daewoo Group, and employs nearly 13,000 people . It's aiming to be the first shipbuilder to deliver a cargo ship for ocean operation that runs entirely on fuel cells powered by natural gas. Currently, an estimated 80 percent of the vessels in the world's shipping fleet operate using bunker fuel. ""Bloom thinks Samsung is a good partner and information on what the company sees as a trend for more efficient transportation and heavy shipping,"" Preeti Pande, vice president of strategic market development for Bloom, told GreenBiz.

More new wind farms were approved at the height of the pandemic than during all last year. Some of these offshore projects include battery storage or hydrogen.

In this episode of The Energy Gang , we'll explore the "" super-hybrid "" approach to renewables. Then, is green hydrogen here to stay? One Saudi project unveiled last month is at gigawatt scale. Another major utility is getting out of America’s largest coal plant and making investments in solar-generated hydrogen. Bloom Energy is even making electrolyzers. What does this activity tell us?

The bankrupt utility is struggling to secure its grid from causing more deadly wildfires, and has been stymied in attempts to set up natural gas-backed microgrids to power substations during fire-prevention blackouts. But California regulators are adamant that PG&E find a more permanent and less costly and polluting backup plan in the years ahead — even if it’s not clear yet what form it may take. On June 11, the California Public Utilities Commission plans to vote on a proposed decision that would greenlight PG&E’s plan to secure up to 450 megawatts of mobile generators to back up communities during public safety power outage events this summer and fall.
