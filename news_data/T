Thanks to positive vaccine news, the S&P 500 rose nearly 11% to deliver some of its best gains in the past 30 years while out-of-favor value stocks staged a massive comeback from their underperformance in the last decade or more. Since Pfizer's early November announcement that its vaccine had a 90%+ efficacy rate , Goldman Sachs' long/short value factor, which underperformed for most of the last four years, has surged 12% as of December 3, according to a Monday client note. For investors who have missed the value train, there are still other opportunities that have lagged the market but are well-positioned for the post-pandemic economy. Aside from cyclically oriented value stocks, S&P 500 dividend futures remain an attractive opportunity that trades at significant discounts, Chief US Equity Strategist David Kostin said in the note. While realized S&P 500 dividends per share fell by 5.6% year-over-year in the third quarter, many companies such as Darden Restaurants (DRI), Marathon Oil (MRO), and Estee Lauder (EL) that had suspended dividend payments earlier in the year due to COVID-19 impacts have now resumed, Kostin explained.","T,JNJ",en,Business Insider

""Niemand will Filme dringender auf die Leinwand zurückbringen als wir"", sagte Ann Sarnoff, Chefin der WarnerMedia Studios. Aber man müsse sich den Realitäten stellen. Vor diesem Hintergrund rutschten die Aktien von AMC, der weltgrößten Kinokette, um fast neun Prozent ab. Für das kommende Jahr stehen bei Warner Bros. unter anderem ""Godzilla vs. Kong"", die Computerspiel-Adaption ""Mortal Kombat"", der zweite Teil der Comic-Verfilmung ""Suicide Squad"", ein Remake des Science Fiction-Klassikers ""Dune"" sowie die Fortsetzung der ""Matrix""-Reihe in den Startlöchern.",T,de,KURIER Medienhaus

A similar joint filing was made by Amazon.com Inc., AT&T Inc., Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp., Comcast Corp., Sonos Inc., Duck Duck Go Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc.Concerns about such disclosures have emerged since the government sued Google for allegedly abusing its power to thwart competition.

Many travel rewards credit card benefits are currently unusable due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, so card issuers have rolled out new perks tailored to life in quarantine. Capital One is letting select cardholders redeem miles to cover food delivery, streaming service, and mobile phone purchases. Chase introduced a valuable Pay Yourself Back option that lets you use points for groceries, dining, and home-improvement purchases. If you have an American Express card, you may see Amex Offers for cash back on wine purchases, or for bonus points on food delivery. See Business Insider's list of the best rewards credit cards. In the scheme of things, not being able to fully maximize your rewards credit cards during the coronavirus pandemic isn't the biggest problem. But many of the best rewards cards charge high annual fees, and several of their top benefits like airport lounge access and bonus rewards are related to travel, so it can feel difficult to justify the fees when you can't put those perks to use.",T,en,Business Insider

At the time, Quibi was supposed to be the proverbial ace up T-Mobile's sleeve, luring customers to premium wireless plans with star-studded content packaged in 10-minute increments so as not to strain the goldfishlike attention spans of viewers accustomed to YouTube rabbit holes and interminable TikTok feeds. Alas, Quibi last week announced that it was shutting down. There has been no shortage of postmortem takes: Quibi's untimely demise has been attributed variously to the limitations of the mobile-only format, overly restrictive sharing functionality, and pandemic impacts on consumer viewing behavior. But perhaps Quibi's fatal flaw, as Spencer Kornhaber observed early on in The Atlantic, was simply that for all the platform's futuristic accouterments, ""there is no great TV on Quibi."" Despite being Quibi's exclusive wireless partner, T-Mobile will emerge relatively unscathed from the platform's demise, thanks to the carrier's diversified, risk-averse media strategy.","TBB,T",en,Business Insider

2020-10-22 02:18:00.120000-05:00,We pay Big Tech to promote our services: Google on lawsuit,"New Delhi: Stressing that this is not the dial-up 1990s when changing services was slow and difficult and often required to buy and install software with a CD-ROM, Google has vehemently defended its position after the US Department of Justice and 11 state Attorneys General sued the tech giant for allegedly abusing its market position in the domain of online search. Claiming that the lawsuit relies on dubious antitrust arguments, Google said that like countless other businesses, the company pays to promote its services. For digital services, when you first buy a device, it has a kind of home screen ""eye level shelf."" ""On mobile, that shelf is controlled by Apple, as well as companies like AT&T, Verizon, Samsung and LG. On desktop computers, that shelf space is overwhelmingly controlled by Microsoft,"" argued Kent Walker, SVP of Global Affairs at Google. So Google negotiates agreements with many of those companies for eye-level shelf space. ""Our agreements with Apple and other device makers and carriers are no different from the agreements that many other companies have traditionally used to distribute software,"" Walker said.

Esports and gaming have burst into the mainstream in recent years, transforming from a vibrant niche to a central form of entertainment around the world. While esports may have once stood for a subset of sports culture, it has grown into a full industry in its own right. That shift has been powered by championing from mainstream celebrities like Michael Jordan, Drake, and DJ Marshmello, an increasing amount of coverage from traditional outlets like ESPN, and, at least in part, the breakneck rise of Fortnite. As competitive gaming cements itself in the popular culture, global investors, brands, media outlets, and consumers are all paying attention. Total esports viewership is expected to grow at a 9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2019 and 2023, up from 454 million in 2019 to 646 million in 2023, per Business Insider Intelligence estimates.","TBB,T",en,Business Insider

The lawsuit, which is being brought by the US Department of Justice and 11 state attorneys general, takes a relatively narrow focus on Google's dominance in search and search advertising. Google, the suit argues, has leveraged its dominance to maintain partnerships, including a lucrative deal to be the default search provider on Apple devices, that has shut out rivals. The complaint calls back to the Microsoft case of the late 1990s, where the company was accused of illegally bundling its internet browser and operating system together in a way that hurt competitors. The case against Google not only references that case, but explicitly calls back to it in certain places. ""The Justice Department is showing that it isn't just Silicon Valley who clones successful products: they've basically cloned the Microsoft case and added Google's name to it,"" tweeted Columbia University law professor Timothy Wu in response to the Justice Department's Google lawsuit.","TBB,T",en,Business Insider

The $799 starting price is part of a promotional deal with the major US wireless carriers AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon—for those wanting an unlocked iPhone 12, the price starts $30 higher. Beside offering the $30 iPhone subsidy, AT&T and Verizon have also advertised deals in which certain customers can get an iPhone 12 for ""free"" (contingent upon factors such as trading in an old device and subscribing to an unlimited plan). A few days later, T-Mobile responded with its own set of discounts for iPhone 12 models, in some cases offering up to $850 off (though, as with the promotions from AT&T and Verizon, customers will need to tick several eligibility requirements, such as trading in a newer iPhone model).

The scale of the problem — and the difficulty of fixing it — roughly correlate with the scale of platforms themselves. Even if 99% of harmful content is removed from a large platform, an enormous amount can still remain.

While the promise of 5G networks is speedier connections, a private 5G network means more privacy and that a firm also wouldn't have to deal with anyone else using the network and slowing things down.

At the end of 2019, Deloitte analysts predicted that more than a hundred companies would experiment with private 5G networks by the end of this year. Companies like Ford and Honeywell are already testing them in their warehouses and factories to make processes more efficient. Now, a fresh-from-stealth startup called Celona wants to take a bite out of the 5G enterprise market, which market research firm Polaris estimates is worth $1.32 billion .

But the 25-year-old firm also has a history of worker exploitation, according to a new ProPublica report . Arise Virtual Solutions acts as a middleman between gig workers — who, ProPublica reports, are mostly women and people of color — and big companies, pairing the remote customer service workers with large corporate clients. Arise's clientele includes Amazon, Apple, AT&T, Disney, eBay, Peloton, Virgin Atlantic, and many others, according to the outlet. The corporations are drawn to Arise's services in part because of how quickly the firm can hire workers, the report notes. But Arise can also easily fire those customer service agents, without severance or insurance, in what is another example of how rampant worker vulnerability and exploitation can be in the gig economy. Arise has been hit with federal class-action lawsuits since 2011, with workers alleging federal labor law violations and wrongful treatment of employees.","TBB,T",en,Business Insider

The problem appears to have started at some point yesterday, with tax preparation service Waters, Hardy & Co receiving hundreds of phone calls from confused customers. In a Facebook post, the company said that it had received so many calls from ‌Apple Card‌ owners that its phones had to be turned off. MacRumors reader Kyle alerted us to the problem. He found an incorrect merchant charge for ""Waters, Hardy & Co"" listed in the Wallet app, which was actually his bill from AT&T. He contacted the company and received a voice recording with a message that said Apple had incorrectly listed Waters, Hardy & Co as the merchant for the AT&T charges. Another MacRumors reader mentioned the same issue yesterday, noting a ""weird charge"" on the ‌Apple Card‌, presumably from Waters, Hardy & Co. Based on the reports we've seen and the hundreds of calls received by Waters, Hardy & Co., this appears to be affecting quite a few AT&T customers who use ‌Apple Card‌ for their bills.","TBB,T",en,Mac Rumors
2020-10-01 14:36:00-05:00,5G FAQ: What is 5G and when is it coming to the iPhone?,"The marketing machine for 5G is just getting warmed up. AT&T arguably fired the first shot when it started re-labeling some of its 4G LTE service “5G Evolution,” complete with a “5G e” logo in the status bar of some phones. Soon, 5G will be everywhere you look. All four major carriers are spending big money hyping up “5G” and trying to convince you that, first of all, you need it, and two, you need it from that carrier. It’s all needlessly confusing, too. The carriers are trying to bamboozle us with big bandwidth numbers, misleading coverage maps, and confusing claims that have little to do with reality. Here’s what you really need to know about 5G and how it’s going to impact you as an iPhone user. To read this article in full, please click here","TBB,T",en,Macworld

The Lenovo Flex 5G is available right now through Verizon, and more 5G-capable laptops are on the way. But is now the right time to buy one? Sure, the idea of a 5G-enabled laptop is tempting. During my tests with the Flex 5G, I managed to get download speeds between 381Mbps and 476.7Mbps, with upload speeds in the 50Mbps range. That pretty much blows away the throughput on my home Wi-Fi network. Of course, you’ll only get those astounding 5G download speeds if you’re in a Verizon 5G coverage area, and as of now, they’re hard to come by. While AT&T and T-Mobile offer much broader 5G coverage, their slower but longer-range sub-6GHz 5G networks aren’t nearly as fast as Verizon’s speedier but (much) shorter-range mmWave 5G network.

2020-09-28 11:58:00-05:00,Multimedia: Microsoft baut Geschäft mit Mobilfunk-Providern aus,"Redmond (dpa) - Microsoft hat eine breit angelegte Initiative gestartet, um Mobilfunkprovider mit maßgeblichen Komponenten für die Infrastruktur von 5G-Netzen zu versorgen. Das Programm «Azure for Operators» soll die Microsoft-Kunden insbesondere in die Lage versetzen, in ihren 5G-Netzwerken das so genannte Edge Computing anbieten zu können. Microsoft dringt damit zumindest teilweise in Marktbereiche ein, die bislang von Techkonzernen wie Huawei, Ericsson, Nokia und Samsung dominiert werden. Edge Computing beschreibt ein Technik-Konzept, bei dem die Verarbeitung der Daten nicht auf einem weit entfernten, zentralen Server stattfindet, sondern dezentral am Rand eines Netzwerks. Um die Laufzeit der Daten zu verkürzen, soll die Datenverarbeitung dabei möglichst nah an den Ort der Datenentstehung und Datennutzung heranrücken. Niedrige Laufzeiten («Latenz») spielen insbesondere beim Internet der Dinge (IoT), autonomen Fahren oder in der vernetzten Industrie 4.0 eine Rolle. Aber auch bei Computerspielen oder der Telemedizin kommt es auf geringe Latenz-Werte an.","TBB,T",de,Westfalen-Blatt
2020-09-28 11:32:20-05:00,Microsoft enters 5G race with Azure cloud for telecom operators,"STOCKHOLM: Microsoft Corp unveiled a new cloud platform on Monday aimed at enabling telecom operators to build 5G networks faster, reduce costs and sell customised services to business clients. After banning China's Huawei from its telecom network, the US government has been pushing big American companies such as Microsoft to get more involved with 5G – a technology which promises to enable everything from self-driving cars to remote surgery and more automated manufacturing. The new platform will be on Azure, Microsoft's flagship cloud computing business, and the company says it will reduce infrastructure costs, give flexibility to add services on demand and use artificial intelligence to automate operations. Yousef Khalidi, corporate vice president for Azure Networking, told Reuters that it could cut costs by 30%-40% in some cases. The developer of Windows and Office software entered the 5G arena after its acquisition of cloud networking companies Affirmed Networks and Metaswitch earlier this year. ""The telco DNA was obtained through those acquisitions and we went from a small number of engineers in this space to literally hundreds of engineers,"" said Khalidi. ""On the other hand, the foundational pieces, including edge compute, we have had in a pipeline for many years."" The company has already partnered with companies ranging from telecom operators such as Verizon and AT&T to network equipment firms such as Samsung and Mavenir to either use or sell the new platform to clients.","TBB,T",en,The Sun Daily

Perhaps investors were still digesting an earlier warning from JPM that iPhone sales were ""moderating substantially"", despite the unprecedented springtime launch of the iPhone SE, the company's new budget-focused model. iPhone sales have been moderating despite the success of the smaller phones, and despite various promotions, and efforts to clear inventory, according to a series of projections from JPM. Apple has managed to protect its immense post-stock-split valuation by shifting the focus to its thriving services business (along with a brief spike in device sales between April and the end of June) and the looming advent of 5G.

The pandemic has accelerated cord cutting as the number of streaming services grows while advertisers cut linear TV budgets and rework big commitments with networks like NBCUniversal, Disney, and ViacomCBS. And AT&T — one of the biggest sellers of targeted, or so-called addressable advertising — is reportedly mulling spinning off its pay-TV service DirecTV and digital ad firm Xandr that was supposed to help it along.

Why would it? After going nearly straight up for the last five months, it’s only natural for there to be a pullback. This was particularly true for technology stocks. They’d reached such dizzying heights it was just a matter of time before the thin air got to them. And get to them it did. Some of the mania’s favorites, like Apple, Tesla, and Nvida, fainted in unison…dropping 8 percent, 9 percent, and 9.3 percent, respectively. A company called PagerDuty garnered the honor of the day’s biggest loser. The San Francisco based company, which operates in the cloud, made a graceful 25.8 percent swan dive from its heavenly realm.

""AT&T alone has the components to solve this problem."" The mantra was, bigger was better. The idea was that by melding data, distribution, and content, AT&T could juice its slowing core wireless business, because there are only so many phone services people can sign up for, and take on Facebook and Google's dominance of digital advertising. In short order, AT&T acquired DirecTV for $48.5 billion, Time Warner for $84.5 billion, and digital ad company AppNexus for $1.6 billion.

AT&T made a big bet on using data and media properties to target and measure ads, scooping up media giant Time Warner and later, AppNexus, for about $1.6 billion. It created an ad unit called Xandr to change how TV advertising is sold for WarnerMedia and beyond. But Xandr hit snags, with leadership changes and challenges plugging AT&T data into advertising. Some media buyers have criticized it as not enabling robust enough targeting and expressed concern that Xandr will become a walled garden that limits the number of publishers and data that advertisers can access. And earlier this year, Brian Lesser, who led Xandr and was its champion, left the company. Now AT&T is reportedly looking to sell Xandr in a move to shed less profitable divisions, according to The Wall Street Journal . AT&T is also reportedly mulling a sale of DirectTV.

Zac Estrada Tue, 08/18/2020 - 01:00 In the race to drastically cut emissions in shipping, one of the industry's biggest names, Samsung Heavy Industries, is teaming with fuel cell company Bloom Energy to develop a more sustainable fuel designed to meet steep international targets. Under the partnership, announced in June, the companies will collaborate on creating fuel cell powertrains for commercial ships, potentially providing one critical path to a clean technology future for marine shipping. The goal is to replace oil-based power generation. Samsung is one of the largest shipbuilders in South Korea, along with the Hyundai Group and the Daewoo Group, and employs nearly 13,000 people . It's aiming to be the first shipbuilder to deliver a cargo ship for ocean operation that runs entirely on fuel cells powered by natural gas. Currently, an estimated 80 percent of the vessels in the world's shipping fleet operate using bunker fuel.

En mayo pasado la señal de DirecTV fue bloqueada por las sanciones del Gobierno de Estados Unidos contra el régimen de Nicolás Maduro, entre ellas, la prohibición de las empresas norteamericanas de operar con empresas venezolanas. Y la televisión por cable retransmitía los canales de Globovisión y PdvsaTV, cuyos dueños Raúl Gorrin y Rafael Ramírez (expresidente de Petróleos de Venezuela), respectivamente, son acusados por corrupción y lavado de dinero en EEUU. Pero la medida había dejado en el abandono y la oscuridad informativa a unos 2 millones de suscriptores durante el confinamiento prolongado de la pandemia. En ese tiempo el presidente interino de Venezuela, Juan Guaidó, siempre alentaba con la esperanza de que DirecTV volvería pronto a funcionar, sin dar detalles de lo que se estaba negociando tras los bastidores.","TBB,T",es,ABC Spain

And blending network operations for customers under the Sprint and T-Mobile brands likely helped to suppress churn. T-Mobile announced in its Q2 2020 earnings last week that it ended June with 98.3 million US subscribers, surpassing AT&T to become the second-largest US carrier by subscribers. (Notably, AT&T doesn't include hotspots and car sensors in its figures, which T-Mobile does, per The Wall Street Journal.) Mike Sievert, T-Mobile president and CEO, said in the earnings call that ""we're staring down Verizon and our sight [is] set on the number one spot."" T-Mobile's subscriber accrual is helped by the low churn it maintained, which was likely aided by migrating Sprint customers onto its better network. T-Mobile reported a postpaid phone churn of 0.82% in Q2 2020 — for context, in their Q2 earnings, Verizon reported a wireless retail postpaid churn of 0.69% and AT&T reported a postpaid phone churn of 0.84%.

One of the starkest inequalities exposed by the coronavirus pandemic is the difference between the digital haves and have-nots. Those with a fast internet connection are more able to work and learn remotely, stay in touch with loved ones and access critical services such as telemedicine. For the millions of Americans who live in an internet dead zone , fully participating in society in the age of social distancing has become difficult, if not impossible. But if the pandemic has laid bare America’s so-called ""digital divide,"" climate change will only worsen the inequality that stems from it.

But how is the former Deutsche Bank prop trader making a killing when most of his hedge fund peers are struggling to post a positive return for 2020, let alone beat the S&P500? Conveniently, we have the answer courtesy of a Bloomberg profile digging deep into Weinstein's current living conditions, which just incidentally also happens to discuss his latest - and perhaps greatest - trading strategy. Bloomberg starts off by chronicling Weinstein's current living conditions which in this time of pervasive coronavirus lockdowns, are whimsical, even by a hedge fund manager's standards: Weinstein has repaired to his gated estate in Sagaponack, replete with tennis court, pool and a Vegas-style card room.","TBB,T",en,Zero Hedge

Now, they're coming after 21st-century big tech. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Apple CEO Tim Cook will attempt to make their case as to why their firms aren't infringing on the competition in a hearing Wednesday. The hearing is part of a yearlong congressional investigation into online market competition. The ongoing investigation could eventually lead to more specific legislation designed to keep tech companies from growing too big and mighty — just like how three original antitrust laws began reining in the oil and railroad companies over 100 years ago.

The biggest loser leaders include Energy, Consumer Discretionary, Industrials and Financial sectors, according to FactSet’s John Butters. “If -43.8% is the actual decline for the quarter, it will mark the largest year-over-year decline in earnings for the index since Q4 2008 (-69.1%),” he wrote in a recent update.

2020-06-30 22:31:00-05:00,3 big catalysts that will drive growth of all telco players,"The banks do not have the capital on an industry-wide basis, says Ajay Bagga, Market Expert.What is your take on the recent trend of fundraising, including Axis, that we are seeing among banks?I think the moratorium impact will be about 6% to 7%; more on the NPAs. So roughly 9% is banks’ NPAs right now. It can add another 6% to 7% more. Axis has been one bank where the CEO has been very transparent. For the last three months, he has been saying it is better to go for one-time restructuring so that the bank’s capital does not get impacted. Even Uday Kotak made that point that Rs 100 lakh crores is the bank’s outstanding assets and the outstanding loans that they have given and the capital is about Rs 11-12 lakh crore. So you do not have too much capital. In case there is a flow through of Rs 5 lakh crore, more flows through into NPA because of this lockdown. The banks do not have the capital on an industry-wide basis. So last week there was some chatter that the RBI board meeting could take a point and even the FM tweeted that we are taking it up with the RBI.","TBB,T",en,Economic Times India

2020-06-25 11:30:03-05:00,Verizon and AT&T new pricing options could help attract prepaid subscribers amid economic downturn,"Verizon unveiled a new pricing mechanism within its prepaid plans that gives consumers discounts based on the duration they remain on a Verizon plan. The first discount of $5 kicks in after three months, while the second discount of $10 activates after nine months. This comes just a few weeks after AT&T launched pricing options for its prepaid service, in which subscribers receive a lower monthly rate by prepaying for either three months or a full year of service. These pricing features will help AT&T and Verizon attract prepaid subscribers who can become profitable long-term customers. Relative to postpaid plans, prepaid plans tend to attract more price-sensitive, less loyal customers. So while wireless carriers could grow their base of prepaid customers by undercutting competitors on price, this strategy isn't necessarily effective, because those customers are more likely to leave once they find a better deal. This makes it hard for carriers to ever raise prices without also losing customers, making this a low-margin strategy.","TBB,T",en,Business Insider

Although competition in the US wireless carrier market remains fierce, the price war among the Big Four US carriers — Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint — began to cool over the past year. In an attempt to avoid further competition on price, carriers began shifting their focus to adding value to their mobile plans with new offerings to differentiate from the competition. This helped average revenue per user (ARPU) start to stabilize across all carriers in Q1 2018, after declining over the last two years. The Big Four have now begun reshuffling their unlimited plans to lure subscribers by providing more options. This strategy has been unrolling in two flavors: introducing new, expensive unlimited plan tiers loaded with an array of features and choices, while also catering to price-sensitive customers with more affordable plans that strip away extra perks like free digital content and international coverage.","TBB,T",en,Business Insider

Purchase this report. To check to see if you already have access to Business Insider Intelligence through your company, click here. Content moderation has become a top priority for social platforms — including Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Pinterest, and LinkedIn — amid rising public and political scrutiny and escalating content-related crises. Brands, lawmakers, and even social media execs are coming to grips with the reality that platforms are not up to the task of moderating content on their own, primarily due to their massive scale. The scale of the problem — and the difficulty of fixing it — roughly correlate with the scale of platforms themselves. Even if 99% of harmful content is removed from a large platform, an enormous amount can still remain. Even leadership at social platforms believe their platforms should have oversight from external stakeholders, with some either publicly stating that belief or privately meeting with regulators.","TBB,T",en,Business Insider

The CBRS spectrum — also sought after by mobile network operators AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile — would enable the cable operators to handle a greater portion of MVNO traffic on standalone networks. Now that Cox announced its reentry into the mobile market, all three cable operators are looking to expand MVNO services, which have proven to be relatively resilient business segments amid the current economic downturn. Purchasing CBRS spectrum would enable Cox, Comcast, and Charter to strategically deploy standalone mobile networks to realize cost savings in their hybrid MVNO models. When they launched, cable MVNOs aimed to realize cost savings by first steering customers toward their wired cable networks, and then supplementing coverage with wireless carrier partnerships. Charter, for instance, used eSIMs to first steer its Xfinity Mobile subscribers toward its Wi-Fi hotspots, and if those weren't available, it deferred to leased wireless service from Verizon.","TBB,T",en,Business Insider

In the face of rising demand for data, increasingly saturated mobile markets, and stiff opposition from legacy players, tech entrants, and startups, global telecoms are locked in a battle for market share. These market pressures have led to vicious price wars for mobile services and, as a result, declining average revenue per user (ARPU). Making matters worse, improvements in infrastructure and technology have made telecoms largely comparable in terms of coverage, connection speeds, and service pricing, meaning companies must transform their businesses if they hope to compete. For many global telecoms, shoring up market share under today's pressures while also future-proofing operations means having to invest in AI. The telecom industry is expected to invest $36.7 billion annually in AI software, hardware, and services by 2025, according to Tractica.","TBB,T",en,Business Insider

On phones with a notch, it appears when you swipe down to reveal the Control Center. However, the label appears after the name of your cellular carrier.

Katie Soo, who oversees growth marketing for HBO Max, told Business Insider how the forthcoming streaming service is leveraging social media and pop culture in its launch marketing. HBO Max's marketing creative aims to strike a ""more fun and playful tone"" than the HBO brand to distinguish itself from its premium-TV sister, Soo said. Her team is also reacting on social to trending stories, like a May article from The Cut on the varying attractions of ""Lord of the Rings"" characters Aragorn and Legolas, as well as hosting watch parties, livestreams, and influencer-driven campaigns. ""We have to market in a way that not only appeals to broader groups, but everything also needs to be authentic,"" Soo said. ""Take 'Crazy Rich Asians' … the way our communities lifted the story, localized the campaign, and showcased the film is exactly the way we need to think about diversifying our messaging.""

It's by no means a widespread network that everyone can connect to. Progress and innovation like 5G is good, and it's not unusual that it costs more. But, what's the point of paying for 5G tech if you can't connect to it yet?

I especially recommend the $500 OnePlus 7T from 2019. Android phone makers are coming out with some great smartphones in 2020 so far, but 5G is ruining the party. Indeed, 5G is making phones more expensive than ever before, where 5G tech like mobile processors, modems, and antennas are adding up to $200 extra to what smartphones used to cost in 2019.

The main things going for it are its powerful specs, which are albeit common in high-end phones. The phone also has very effective cameras. Its screen is too curved, however, and its design doesn't have the final polish that's expected on such an expensive smartphone. And, if you're not a Verizon customer, you might as well click away — this phone is a Verizon exclusive, and it's not worth switching for. You're better off with the OnePlus 8 Pro if you need to buy a new phone in 2020. The Motorola Edge Plus goes on sale on May 14. Motorola is back to making high-end smartphones, which I thoroughly appreciate. The high-end smartphone category is in dire need of competition — it's primarily populated by only two companies in the US: Apple and Samsung.

2020-05-07 12:58:00-05:00,The investment Magic Leap is seeking from a major health company could help it pivot towards healthcare AR applications,"Alternative reality (AR) company Magic Leap reportedly signed a terms sheet with a major health company, according to Business Insider. The Information first reported the potential deal, which could entail a $100 million equity investment. There is still significant uncertainty surrounding the terms of deal, however, as Magic Leap's CEO purportedly told employees there's still a chance it could fall through, and some employees are said to believe it could result in a full acquisition rather than equity stake. In late April, Magic Leap — which had previously raised over $2.6 billion from the likes of AT&T and Google on the promise of its AR technology — cut half of its workforce and decided to focus solely on enterprise applications going forward. Beyond giving Magic Leap a lifeline, the investment from a health company will likely facilitate an opportunity for Magic Leap to focus more exclusively on healthcare AR applications. Magic Leap already had to narrow the scope of its target market to sustain operations during the current funding crunch , and the investment from a healthcare company could take that a step further — the unnamed health company reportedly plans to use Magic Leap's AR headsets for surgical procedures and healthcare professional training.",T,en,Business Insider

To learn more about 13D’s investment research, please visit their website . Corporate debt is the timebomb everyone saw ticking, but no one was able to defuse. Ratings agencies warned about it: Moody’s, S&P. Central banks and international financial institutions did too: the Fed, the Bank of England, the Bank for International Settlements, the IMF. Financial luminaries expressed concern: Jamie Dimon, Seth Klarman, Jes Staley, Jeffrey Gundlach, Henry McVey. Even a presidential candidate brought the issue on the campaign trail: Elizabeth Warren. Yet, as we’ve documented in these pages for more than two years, corporations have only piled on more debt as their balance sheet health has deteriorated.

2020-04-03 08:47:07-05:00,How soaring unemployment will impact wireless carriers,"More than 6.6 million US adults filed for unemployment benefits last week, shattering previous records, according to Business Insider. Just under 10 million in the US have now filed for unemployment in second half of March — this surpassed the number of unemployment filings completed in the first six months of the Great Recession. Anticipating economic fallout that could be caused by widespread quarantine measures, all major US network operators agreed to a 60-day pact with provisions to waive coronavirus-related late fees and to suspend internet cut-offs due to unpaid bills. Additionally, AT&T and T-Mobile introduced low-cost prepaid plans that could staunch subscriber losses as many consumers look to cut costs. As consumers cut spending on nonessential goods, we anticipate many will downgrade wireless plans but retain some form of service. Half of US consumers are already spending less on nonnecessities, and 89% of respondents anticipate it will take more than one month before their spending on nonessential goods returns to normal, according to the Business Insider Intelligence Coronavirus Consumer Survey.",T,en,Business Insider

2020-03-25 09:47:54-05:00,Wireless tools tracking the spread of the coronavirus could stoke consumers' fears of privacy overreach,"Mass surveillance appears to be among the most effective tools to combat the spread of the coronavirus, but by sharing detailed location data with governments, wireless carriers could be setting a long-term precedent that alienates consumers. In South Korea, SK Telecom launched a real-time location-tracking tool that police can use to identify and break up large gatherings. In China, the government has mandated the adoption of smartphone software to track citizens' health, which determines their access to public spaces. Since South Korea and China have been two of the most effective countries in containing domestic outbreaks, many other governments — including in Austria, Israel , Russia , the UK, and the US — have petitioned domestic wireless carriers to help institute similar programs. This presents a double-bind for wireless carriers, as helping create a near-term public health tool will also amplify consumer privacy concerns. In the US, wireless carriers have thus far demonstrated a willingness to break operational norms to combat the pandemic.","T,TBB",en,Business Insider

2020-03-22 12:06:52-05:00,Coronavirus led to the biggest smartphone shipment decline in history,"Global smartphone shipments in February dropped by 38% compared to last year, setting a record-breaking decline in the process. With millions of individuals still stuck at home on quarantine, there's a good chance the decline will be more pronounced in March. Apple retail stores outside of China remain closed and there's no telling when they may re-open for business. Visit BGR’s homepage for more stories . In a development that shouldn't come as a surprise to anybody, global smartphone shipments in February dropped by 38% year-over-year, according to a new report from Strategy Analytics . The 38% drop off marks the biggest decline in smartphone shipments in history, a fact which can obviously be attributed to the coronavirus. As to the specific figures, global smartphone shipments in February of last year checked in at 99.2 million units. Last month, smartphone shipments dropped down to 61.8 million units. ""Smartphone demand collapsed in Asia last month, due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and this dragged down shipments across the world,"" the report reads in part. ""Some Asian factories were unable to manufacture smartphones, while many consumers were unable or unwilling to visit retail stores and buy new devices."" Looking forward, there's no telling when the smartphone market will bounce back.","T,TBB",en,BGR.com
2020-03-21 02:00:07-05:00,The coronavirus might have just killed ISP data caps,"Data caps at broadband internet providers might be a coronavirus casualty nobody will miss—except the ISPs that had profited from them. In less than a week, the top U.S. internet service providers imposing data caps have waived those limits to accommodate the millions of Americans now working and learning from home to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. And Patient Zero in this particular outbreak was an unlikely suspect: AT&T, an aggressive adopter of data caps that it , like Comcast and others, had pitched as a fair-minded response to the alleged unfairness of some people using so much more of their connection than you. Hours after a March 12 piece at Vice’s Motherboard site scolded ISPs for retaining data caps in this growing crisis, the Dallas telecom giant told the tech news site’s Karl Bode that it would suspend $10-and-up overage charges that kicked in after just 150 GB a month for digital-subscriber-line users or 1 TB for its fiber-connected customers. The next day, after Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai asked internet providers to “Keep Americans Connected” but didn’t call for lifting data caps, Comcast and CenturyLink followed AT&T’s example by setting aside their 1 TB limits.","T,TBB",en,Fast Company

Verizon will reduce store hours and cut staffing headcounts by half, though it has committed to paying employees for any shifts lost as a result. AT&T announced it would close 2,200 stores, representing 40% of nationwide locations, and reduce operating hours at other locations. T-Mobile and Sprint took more aggressive measures, shutting down 80% and 71% of retail locations, respectively; T-Mobile also reduced the operating hours of its stores that will remain open. These measures are intended to protect employees and adhere to social distancing guidelines for limiting the spread of the coronavirus, which has infected over 10,000 people in the US across all 50 states, per The New York Times.

2020-03-18 08:37:23-05:00,Economic fallout from coronavirus could reverse wireless carrier migration from prepaid to postpaid plans,"The number of prepaid wireless customers shrank by a record of 238,000 subscribers in Q4 2019, as the market increasingly shifted toward postpaid plans, according to Cowen data cited by LightReading. The record quarter bookends a year in which the wireless industry saw its first collective net loss in prepaid customers, ending with 330,000 fewer than at the start of the year. These metrics do not necessarily spell bad news for US wireless carriers, however, as prepaid customers tend to be more price sensitive and less loyal to carriers, compared with postpaid subscribers. AT&T , Verizon , and T-Mobile all saw net postpaid subscriber additions over the course of 2019, a testament to the overall health of their businesses. In AT&T's Q4 2019 earnings call, COO John Stankey said customers were shifting from prepaid to postpaid as the economy improved and the gap narrowed between postpaid and prepaid plans. The economic fallout catalyzed by the coronavirus pandemic will likely disrupt the migration away from prepaid plans or comparable options.","T,TBB",en,Business Insider

In an effort to protect consumers from high overages or connectivity issues that may result from increased internet use, Democratic members of both the FCC and the US Senate have asked internet service providers (ISPs) to temporarily suspend broadband caps and overage fees for affected communities. Consequently, broadband providers are lifting caps on data usage and increasing peak data speeds in response to the coronavirus outbreak: AT&T temporarily lifted broadband usage caps, per Motherboard. The carrier usually imposes broadband usage caps that range from 150 GB for low-cost plans to 1 TB per month for higher-cost plans. When customers reach their data limit they receive an overage charge of $10 per each additional 50 GB consumed.

To check to see if you already have access to Insider Intelligence through your company, click here. Activist investor Elliott Management Corp. is pushing for changes at Twitter, including possibly ousting CEO Jack Dorsey and replacing him with a full-time chief executive, after taking a $1 billion (about 4%) stake in the company, per sources to Bloomberg. Among complaints Elliott has of Dorsey's leadership are that he splits his time between heading Twitter and mobile payments company Square, which he also co-founded, and Dorsey's plan to spend three-to-six months in Africa this year. Elliott has also nominated four directors it would like to install on Twitter's eight-member board when three seats come up for election in May. Among tech companies, Twitter is comparatively vulnerable to activist investor complaints because it lacks the super-voting structure in place at companies like Facebook and Snap.","T,TBB",en,Business Insider

The service offers many features familiar to cable subscribers: a 500-hour DVR, a remote that comes with Google Assistant, four available tiers of channel lineups.

AT&T TV will reduce the company's reliance on costly satellite operations, which will also expand revenue opportunities. When AT&T acquired DirecTV for $49 billion in 2015, it inherited not only millions of subscribers , but also sprawling infrastructure associated with what has become an outmoded system of satellite-based TV.","T,TBB",en,Business Insider

Once signed into law, the bill establishes a $1 billion fund to reimburse rural carriers with fewer than 2 million subscribers for the cost of removing and replacing any networking equipment made by Huawei and ZTE. Rural carriers are not yet mandated to remove Huawei and ZTE equipment, but the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is considering a proposal that would require all companies receiving government funds to do so. The US has long been pushing for the ban of equipment from the two Chinese manufacturers, which the government believes pose a threat to national security. While the $1 billion fund will help some carriers pay to ""rip and replace"" their equipment, it likely won't cover the full cost.

2020-02-21 09:58:19-05:00,Dish's $10 billion 5G build-out budget likely won't be enough to build a standalone cellular network,"Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen used the company's Q4 earnings call to address analysts' concerns that $10 billion would not be enough to build a standalone cellular network. As a condition of T-Mobile acquiring Sprint, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) required Dish to build a standalone network that covers 20% of the US population by 2022. While skeptics have pointed to the far higher network build-out costs of other US carriers, Ergen said he believed they failed to account for technical debt — the costs associated with maintaining old equipment and ensuring backward compatibility. Operations costs, Ergen said , would also be reduced because Dish intends to employ new automation technologies and cloud-based networking. Furthermore, Dish would utilize OpenRAN , a telecommunication standard that makes it easier for network operators to supply components from multiple vendors. While the factors Ergen cited will undoubtedly lead to cost savings, there is still reason to doubt Dish's $10 billion budget will be enough.","T,TBB",en,Business Insider

Samsung's latest Galaxy S20 phones with 5G start at $1,000, and there's no cheaper version of the Galaxy S20 like there was with the Galaxy S10. The high price of Samsung's Galaxy S20 phones set a worrying precedent that the cost of entry for 5G is high, and it'll only be available to those who can afford it. 5G wireless plans are also more expensive, or are only available on the most expensive plans. Still, brand new generations of tech are often expensive at first, and prices come down when they flow into the mainstream. Let's hope the same goes for 5G.

The Forecasting Team at eMarketer combs thousands of vetted sources each day to create forward-looking estimates into the future of a company, trend, or industry.

However, actual time spent will continue to grow: US adults will spend approximately 29 minutes on the streaming platform in 2020, up from 27 minutes last year. These estimates are averaged out for the entire US adult population. According to eMarketer senior forecasting analyst Oscar Orozco and eMarketer analyst Ross Benes, the projected dip is influenced by two opposing forces. Daily time spent on Netflix will continue to grow due to heavy investment in original content, content acquisitions, and personalization of the platform.","T,TBB",en,Business Insider

The $999 Galaxy S20 costs $250 more than the Galaxy S10e, which was the cheapest Galaxy S10 model last year. Even more surprisingly , it's $300 more than the iPhone 11. Yes, it has insane specs, but is having 12GB of RAM on a phone more important than offering an option most people can actually afford? As for 5G connectivity, that's a perk you might not even get to use because coverage is still limited. Then there's the 120Hz screen, which must be more expensive than regular 60Hz OLED screens Samsung has been using so far.

The new flagship devices will be available in three tiers: the Galaxy S20 ($1,000), Galaxy S20+ ($1,200), and Galaxy S20 Ultra ($1,400), all of which are 5G-enabled. These phones will debut on February 21, and will be offered by all major US carriers.

The Galaxy S20+ and Galaxy S20 Ultra will have mmWave support, but the base-tier S20 will only support the Sub-6 5G. mmWave spectrum supports faster data speeds over a smaller coverage area; by comparison, sub-6 has a wider coverage area but sacrifices data transmission speeds. The exclusion of mmWave compatibility on the basic S20 means the phone offers no connectivity improvement over the S10 5G, leaving consumers without access to the fastest 5G data speeds unless they're willing to fork over an additional $200-$400.","T,TBB",en,Business Insider

T-Mobile, the company behind this $26 billion deal and the one whose brand will survive while Sprint’s goes the way of such wireless-trivia-contest answers as Cingular and Nextel, has been touting a future of faster 5G, wider coverage and lower prices. The transaction that U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero endorsed in a lengthy ruling is even meant to respawn a fourth nationwide carrier as Dish Network builds a new 5G network on Sprint’s old bones. Will we get all those things? Take off T-Mobile’s magenta-colored glasses, and the 5G forecast looks clearer than everything else. The 5G math here involves adding overlapping services : Sprint’s far-reaching, fast and underused mid-band 5G wireless spectrum plus T-Mobile’s wider network, which today mainly offers 5G on low-frequency spectrum with little capacity and little added speed. “It’s enormous upside,” said Techsponential analyst Avi Greengart. “T-Mobile should be able to expand its 5G network quickly.” Instead of choosing between Sprint 5G that exceeds 100 megabits per second but only reaches a fraction of its LTE coverage and T-Mobile 5G that’s maybe 25% faster but available almost everywhere, you’d get both the speed and the coverage.","T,TBB",en,Fast Company

Sprint chose not to participate in either preceding auction, while AT&T spent $982 million across the two auctions, T-Mobile spent $842, and Verizon spent $520 million, according to Light Reading. Sprint's choice to abstain from mmWave was likely informed by its faith that the T-Mobile merger will go through, despite facing steep hurdles.

The second-largest US wireless carrier by volume, AT&T collected $36.5 billion in revenue, 1.9% less than its Q4 2018 revenue. During the quarter, the company also gained 3.6 million new wireless customers, down more than 5% year-over-year (YoY) from 3.8 million in Q4 2018. Additionally, the company experienced a higher rate of customer churn at 1.29%, up from 1.23% in Q4 2018.

Building a nationwide 5G network will expand the addressable audience for AT&T's service, which launched in December 2019 in just 10 US cities — by comparison, rival Verizon finished 2019 with 5G service in over 30 cities, after launching commercial 5G in April 2019.","T,TBB",en,Business Insider

Power's annual US Wireless Network Performance Study. The metric reflects the prevalence of network performance issues per 100 connections across call, messaging, and data quality.

BT will provide free Stadia hardware, including a game controller and streaming device for playing on TVs, as well as a free three-month subscription; Stadia's hardware usually costs $129 and it charges a $10-per-month subscription fee. The Stadia bundle can help BT improve its service's appeal, especially to a younger audience that's interested in video games. The majority (76%) of consumers aged 16-36 play video games at least once per week, per Ypulse. The addition of free cloud gaming from Stadia could spur young, first-time consumers to choose BT to gain low-cost access to a growing source of gaming content: Stadia plans to add 120 new games in 2020, up from its current 26.","TBB,T",en,Business Insider

That said, it's hard to imagine anyone stealing Netflix's crown when the company spends $17.3 billion on original content. That's the eye-popping number that Wall Street firm BMO Capital Markets forecasts for Netflix in 2020. Although analysts are keeping a close eye on Netflix ahead of its Q4 results, Cowen & Co.'s John Blackledge said in a note on Thursday that he expects the company to have “a solid quarter,” while BMO’s Dan Salmon said in another note that ""the ‘streaming wars’ narrative is false and there will be multiple winners in global streaming."" BMO says that a majority of Netflix's 2020 budget will be allocated to original programming, such as the animated originals it will produce alongside Nickelodeon, the multiyear deal it made with Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss, and the deals it has made with South Korean content makers which BMO believes will be “a stepping stone to scaling subs in one of [Asia’s] wealthiest and largest addressable markets.” As for comparisons to other major streamers, none come close to matching Netflix's budget.","TBB,T",en,BGR.com

How will we bring about a revolution in both work and leisure? Oscar Wilde dreamed of a world without work. In The Soul of Man Under Socialism (1891) he imagined a society liberated from drudgery by the machine: “while Humanity will be amusing itself, or enjoying cultivated leisure … or making beautiful things, or reading beautiful things, or simply contemplating the world with admiration and delight, machinery will be doing all the necessary and unpleasant work.” This aesthete’s Eden prompted one of his most famous observations: “Is this Utopian? A map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at.” In Wilde’s day the future of work was the first question that every aspiring utopian, from Edward Bellamy to HG Wells, needed to answer. Everything else, from gender relations to crime prevention, flowed from that. But proponents of the more attainable goal of drastically shorter working hours have also included Benjamin Franklin, Bertrand Russell, AT&T president Walter Gifford and John Maynard Keynes .","TBB,T",en,The Guardian

2019-12-16 18:36:03-05:00,AT&T figured out a sneaky way to hide its slower home internet speeds from test results,"We’ve written often here about the different tests that attempt to measure your home broadband speed, which includes crowd-sourced apps from companies like Ookla. And how as soon as you point to results from a source like Ookla, you’ve got to couch them behind caveats like the fact that crowdsourced reports aren’t controlled, and differences in methodology between the networks can introduce bias into the data. It’s a hard thing, measuring broadband speed, and to make matters more complicated is the fact none of the methods are “perfect.” That’s because everything from the equipment you use to the time of day you’re accessing the internet can affect network performance. Measuring everyone’s speed is not as simple or objectively straightforward as using a ruler to, say, measure the length of an object on your desk (in which case there’s one right answer, and it will be the same every time). This brings us to AT&T, and specifically to a step it’s taken in response to the FCC’s SamKnows speed test awarding the carrier a less-than-flattering score on its DSL internet service.","TBB,T",en,BGR.com

AT&T COO John Stankey provided further details on the telecom's ambitious cost-cutting plan unveiled in October, according to Light Reading. In particular, Stankey said the company would cut costs by making management structures and distribution strategy more effective. The management structure initiatives will likely entail cutting and streamlining internal divisions, including those that may be redundant following AT&T's $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner in 2018. In terms of distribution strategy, it appears AT&T may be looking to further sell off networking operations in regions where they see the market as saturated; Stankey alluded to the opportunity to examine ""how our customers are laid out"" and ""start thinking about what we do to take out layers of cost."" In total, the plan aims to cut labor expenses by 4% — representing approximately $1.5 billion — in 2020, according to Light Reading.","TBB,T",en,Business Insider

Bringing cloud capabilities to the edge of networks is particularly important for enabling latency-sensitive 5G applications.

2019-12-05 05:32:44-05:00,Huawei gets back at FCC with legal challenge,"Shenzhen: Hitting back at the regulators and critics, Chinese telecom and smartphone giant Huawei on Thursday sued the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), seeking the court to overturn an order passed on November 22 which bans carriers in rural America from tapping the Universal Service Fund (USF) to purchase Huawei equipment. In a petition filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Huawei asked the court to hold the FCC's order unlawful on the grounds that it fails to offer Huawei required due process protections in labelling it as a national security threat. ""Banning a company like Huawei, just because we started in China -- this does not solve cyber security challenges,"" Song Liuping, Huawei's Chief Legal Officer, said at a press conference here. According to Song, both FCC chairman Ajit Pai and other FCC commissioners failed to present any evidence to prove their claim that Huawei constitutes a security threat, and ignored the facts and objections raised by the company and rural carriers after the FCC first made the proposal in March, 2018.","TBB,T",en,Sify.com

2019-11-30 04:00:19-05:00,Your iPhone could help track disease—if you let researchers spy on you,"In a new study out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, health researchers make the case for using real-time cell-phone data to track and mitigate major disease outbreaks. Unfortunately, several barriers—including privacy concerns and a lack of data legislation—are likely to stop this kind of information from ever getting to researchers. Earlier this year, researchers at MIT set out to see if they could reasonably predict how a disease might move through a city by looking at commute routes. Through a deal with Singapore telecom Singtel, MIT researchers were able to get access to four months’ worth of anonymized cell-phone location data from 2011. The disease they were tracking was a 2013 outbreak of dengue fever, a virus transmitted via mosquito that manifests in headaches, muscle pain, and vomiting. The researchers hypothesized that the disease traveled around the city along the same routes as people’s phones did. When they tested their predictions against census data for 2013 and 2014, which recorded the number of cases over the course of two years, they found the models were accurately estimating the growth trajectory the disease.","TBB,T",en,Fast Company

When 5G networks become prominent, smartphones will be able to maintain a more reliable connection to the cloud and internet-based services, which will boost performance and enable more sophisticated apps to run on your phone. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. For years, we've been hearing about how next-generation 5G networks are going to change the way we access the internet, revolutionizing industries from agriculture to manufacturing and the automotive sector. But now, after years of hype, 2020 seems poised to be the year that 5G finally goes mainstream.

There will be at least three different versions of ""success,"" analysts at Wall Street firm Cowen wrote, in a note on November 20. Streaming products with high valuations, like Netflix and Disney, will be judged by whether they can build scaled and profitable businesses. Legacy media companies like AT&T's WarnerMedia and Comcast's NBCUniversal will have to prove their streaming efforts can make up for other losing parts of their businesses. And tech players Apple and Amazon will be assessed by how much value their streaming efforts add to their existing ecosystems. ""We don't believe that everyone can win,"" the analysts wrote.

""Despite a target price well below AT&T's recent trading range, we've remained Neutral since our upgrade from Sell last November, based largely on the view that global yield starvation would attract capital to AT&T irrespective of its fundamentals,"" he wrote.

In 1919, when the Indian businessman’s great-grandfather wanted to start a jute mill, the dominant British firm, Andrew Yule & Co., bought all the surrounding Calcutta land. The Imperial Bank, the forerunner of today’s State Bank of India, initially refused Birla a loan.The government of post-independence India stymied the Birla conglomerate with kindness. Soviet-style planning and state socialism protected the family’s legacy licensed firms by keeping competition out. But they inhibited growth. Birla’s father, Aditya Vikram, went to Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines because he wasn’t allowed to expand at home. “I for one fail to see where the concentration of economic power is: with the big business houses or with the government?” he wondered in 1979.Fast forward 40 years, and the 52-year-old current chairman of the group would be justified to reprise his late father’s frustration.","TBB,T",en,The Economic Times India

Although the index did increase, TDA clients were still net sellers of equity overall. The positive change in the monthly survey follows a month of solid corporate quarterly earnings and another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve results that helped to push the S&P 500 and other major indexes close to or above all-time highs. Picking Sides In The Streaming Wars One of the most prevalent themes in the October IMX report is how speculation surrounding the media streaming played out in investor portfolios. Chief among the month's beneficiaries is AT&T Inc.

And then I walked right by it. From the hallway, it’s a pretty unassuming place. But something monumental happened there 50 years ago today. A graduate student named Charley Kline sat at an ITT Teletype terminal and sent the first digital data transmission to Bill Duvall, a scientist who was sitting at another computer at the Stanford Research Institute (now known as SRI International) on the other side of California. It was the beginning of ARPANET, the small network of academic computers that was the precursor to the internet. At the time, this brief act of data transfer wasn’t anything like a shot heard round the world. Even Kline and Duvall didn’t appreciate the full significance of what they’d accomplished: “I don’t remember anything specifically memorable about that night, and I certainly didn’t realize that what we had done was anything special at the time,” says Kline.","TBB,T",en,Fast Company

At that time, we noted that leaving OpenAP was AT&T's bid to compete on its own two feet by expanding its data-supported ad offerings. What it means: Xandr Invest will serve as AT&T's central hub for ad-buying as the company adapts media buying and selling to the digital age. AT&T is positioning Xandr Invest as a one-stop shop for ad buyers looking to reach consumers on its properties. Xandr Invest will leverage AT&T's wealth of consumer data and recently acquired AppNexus' ad tech in order to power advanced ad buying on WarnerMedia properties, including CNN, TBS, and TNT.","TBB,T",en,Business Insider

To unlock your Samsung Galaxy S10 , you will need to find the IMEI number for your Galaxy S10 through its Settings app or by dialing *#06# on your phone. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . One of the most frustrating aspects of owning a cell phone is that it's locked into a particular carrier — if you buy an AT&T Samsung Galaxy S10 , it only works with AT&T, for example. At least, that used to be the case. Thanks to a law passed back in 2015 , it's possible to unlock your phone and use it with any carrier, generally with one big caveat — the phone needs to be completely paid for in order for your carrier to unlock it. Make sure your Samsung Galaxy S10 actually needs to be unlocked Before you attempt to unlock your S10 , you should ensure it's actually locked to a carrier — this can save you some time and money.","TBB,T",en,Business Insider

To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here . We learned three key details about the forthcoming WarnerMedia SVOD service last week, per The Wall Street Journal: AT&T is reportedly pricing its forthcoming WarnerMedia SVOD service at $16-$17 a month. It's set to launch in beta later this year, with the full version coming as soon as March 2020. The service will reportedly launch as a single offering at that price point — pivoting from its expected three-tiered pricing strategy. The unified offering will combine TV and movies from across WarnerMedia, including HBO and Warner Bros., into a package for the SVOD, all to be included at the one set price. The telecoms giant might also be considering an ad-supported version of its service to launch in late 2020.It would have a much lower appeal given that it's highly unlikely it would include HBO, which is arguably the most exciting aspect of the SVOD.","TBB,T",en,Business Insider

The agreement will initially only cover networks in the US, Mexico, the Netherlands, France, Romania, and Switzerland, but will expand to at least four additional European countries by the end of 2019. LTE-M networks are well suited for a range of low-bandwidth IoT use cases, such as smart meters and location tracking, as well as connected street lights and smart appliances. And by using an LTE-M network, which require little power, devices' batteries can last for as long as 10 years without replacement, according to GSMA. Here's how this agreement will benefit the participating telecoms: LTE-M roaming presents a new revenue opportunity for telecoms, as it allows them to offer enterprise clients a wider array of low-power asset tracking and connectivity products that work in more markets. By opening more LTE-M networks to IoT devices, the telecoms participating in this agreement have effectively increased the number of available use cases for those networks — and the number of devices and services they can sell.","TBB,T",en,Business Insider

The company pledged nearly $803 million in bids for 1,346 mmWave (24 GHz) licenses, placing it just behind AT&T, which agreed to pay over $982 million for 831 licenses. T-Mobile also pledged $39 billion in bids for 865 mmWave (28GHz) licenses. Having a sufficient amount of spectrum in the mmWave band for 5G networks is important because the frequency range provides the fastest wireless connection speeds, but only over shorter distances, making it ideal for densely populated urban areas that require high-capacity and data-intensive 5G applications. Here's what it means: T-Mobile's spending spree highlights the carrier's attempt to vastly increase its 5G network's speed and capacity. T-Mobile was previously lagging behind Verizon and AT&T in licensed mmWave spectrum — which influenced its 5G strategy. Verizon had 16 times more spectrum in the mmWave frequency band than T-Mobile, largely as a result of its acquisition of Straight Path in 2017 and XO in 2016.","TBB,T",en,Business Insider

Viacom generated $2.96 billion in its fiscal second quarter (ended March 31, 2019), down 6% from $3.15 billion year-over-year (YoY).

The average price consumers are paying for smartphones is rising. In 2018, the average selling price of smartphones is expected to have increased more than 10% from 2017. As the price of smartphones continues to climb, consumers may be less willing to shell out the cash for a new model. Premium phones lack new, generation-specific features.

WarnerMedia's Turner unit is exiting OpenAP, the industry ad consortium founded in 2017 and which came to include Turner, Viacom, Fox Networks Group, NBCUniversal, and Univision, per The Wall Street Journal. The other members will remain, and plan to continue expanding the platform. When it launched, OpenAP hoped to achieve scale and targeting precision that would make advanced TV advertising competitive with the duopoly. The consortium's overarching goal was to standardize the categories for buying TV commercials on different networks. OpenAP set out to do this by consolidating inventory across its members' owned networks and enabling data-driven, audience-based ad buying against TV content.

New Delhi is “number one priority” for Riyadh,” he said.On February 20, Lutyen’s Delhi had even been buzzing with speculation that a deal announcement was due. What came instead at that time was an innocuous statement from the Saudi Aramco chief executive Amin Al-Nasser about joint investments with Reliance in refining and petrochemicals, almost echoing his boss’ previous statements.But for those who still find it difficult to fathom that Mukesh Ambani would seriously consider diluting his hold over the Reliance Industries (RIL) crown jewel, especially since he has always chosen to build rather than buy in his home market, here’s a reality check.RIL has been the busiest dealmaker in India Inc, buying businesses and selling stakes in them.","TBB,T",en,The Economic Times India

Although competition in the US wireless carrier market remains fierce, the price war among the Big Four US carriers — Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint — began to cool over the past year. In an attempt to avoid further competition on price, carriers began shifting their focus to adding value to their mobile plans with new offerings to differentiate from the competition. This helped average revenue per user (ARPU) start to stabilize across all carriers in Q1 2018, after declining over the last two years. The Big Four have now begun reshuffling their unlimited plans to lure subscribers by providing more options. This strategy has been unrolling in two flavors: introducing new, expensive unlimited plan tiers loaded with an array of features and choices, while also catering to price-sensitive customers with more affordable plans that strip away extra perks like free digital content and international coverage.","TBB,T",en,Business Insider

AT&T’s position as a content partner for the Magic Leap One headset will boost subscriptions of its services. AT&T-owned media properties — including CNN and HBO — are being spun into AR apps for the Magic Leap One headset. AT&T also plans to introduce a DirecTV Now AR app for Magic Leap. This partnership helps to expose more consumers to AT&T’s digital content offerings, and could also further incentivize users to pay for subscriptions to some of these services.

2019-03-13 19:25:00-05:00,The Death Of The Internet,"Authored by Jonathan Tepper via The American Conservative blog, Intended to be open, free, and decentralized, it's now dominated by a handful of companies that control what we see and what we can say. The internet was meant to be open, free, and decentralized, but today it is controlled by a few companies with grave consequences for society and the economy. The internet has become the opposite of what it was intended to be. In the early 1960s, Paul Baran was an engineer at the RAND Corporation when he began thinking about the need for a communications network that could withstand a nuclear strike. RAND was contracted by the Pentagon to create a system that could continue operating even if parts of it were destroyed by an atomic blast. It was supposed to be the ultimate decentralized system. Baran went on to publish a paper in 1964 titled “ On Distributed Communications, ” which was influential in establishing the concepts behind the architecture of the internet. Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn put these concepts into practice at the Department of Defense’s Advanced Research Projects Agency in the late 1960s, and created the communication methods that make the internet possible.","TBB,T",en,Zero Hedge

The New York Times noted that House minority leader national security adviser Luke Murry told The Lawfare Podcast that the NSA ""hasn't actually been using it for the past six months,"" and that he's "" not certain that the [Trump] administration will want to start that back up "" (despite collecting 530 million US phone records in 2017 ) Keep in mind, the NYT report isn't claiming the NSA has abandoned other programs such as XKeyscore - which the agency uses to search and analyze global internet data. When asked by German broadcaster Norddeutscher Rundfunk ""What could you do if you would use XKeyscore?"" Snowden replied: You could read anyone's email in the world , anybody you've got an email address for. Any website: You can watch traffic to and from it.

Based on intel from a ""well-informed"" (but once again anonymous) source, the New Yorker reports that in the summer of 2017 - several months before the DOJ filed its antitrust lawsuit, Trump allegedly had an Oval Office sit-down with Cohn and then-chief of staff John Kelly in which he wanted to ""make sure"" the DOJ lawsuit seeking to block the merger was filed. ""I’ve been telling Cohn to get this lawsuit filed and nothing’s happened!"" Trump reportedly told Kelly. ""I’ve mentioned it 50 times. And nothing’s happened. I want to make sure it’s filed. I want that deal blocked!"" According to the New Yorker - Trump's opposition to the deal was thought to be motivated by his hatred for CNN, which is owned by Time Warner.","TBB,T",en,Zero Hedge

But amid the rush to finish a deal by the end of the month, the battle of wills between Chinese telecoms giant Huawei and the US government rages on. And in the latest salvo, Huawei is reportedly suing the US government for prohibiting federal agencies from purchasing Huawei products.

2019-03-01 20:45:00-05:00,America's 10 Largest Corporations Haven't Issued A Single Bond In Over A Year: Here's Why,"Earlier this week, Bloomberg wrote an article titled "" Corporate America Goes on Debt Diet After $3 Trillion Binge "" in which the author argued that due to creeping concerns about rising leverage, US corporations have hit the brakes on debt issuance, citing only three examples to make its case: the massively overleveraged AT&T, Kraft Heinz and GE which indeed disclosed plans to raise liquidity in order to trim their debt. However, a problem with this argument is that it was incorrect: as the following chart of debt issues in just the last week of February shows, the US bond market is anything but fasting; in fact as a result of soaring investor demand for yield, one can argue that most companies are more than eager to add to their incremental leverage even if it means pain down the road when/if rates once again resume their trek higher. However, there was one aspect in which the Bloomberg article was spot on, even if it had nothing to do with the underlying premise presented by Bloomberg.","TBB,T",en,Zero Hedge

The firm covers media and telecom; software; retail; and retail internet areas. A new report from the firm, first reported by Fortune , shows that consumers are ditching their cable and satellite TV packages at near record levels in 4Q18. Cord-cutting was so massive last year that big cable companies could not offset the losses with internet or TV subscriptions. The report said the total number of pay-TV subscribers dropped 4.1% from the prior year, the highest rate of decline since 2010. Approximately 985,000 more customers cut cable or satellite in the quarter than signed up for a new service. The drop did not surprise Craig Moffett, the Founding Partner at MoffettNathanson LLC., who said ""the satellite operators are dead men walking has been obvious to all for some time, and the cable operators, while actually not doing all that badly in video, have made clear that they increasingly view their core business to be broadband, not video,"" adding that ""it may not be an overstatement to say that the pay-TV business as we know it is beginning to unravel.""

""We have strict policies that govern what videos we allow ads to appear on, and videos that promote anti-vaccination content are a violation of those policies. We enforce these policies vigorously, and if we find a video that violates them, we immediately take action and remove ads,"" reads an emailed statement from YouTube to BuzzFeed. Seven different advertisers said they weren’t aware their ads were appearing on videos like “Mom Researches Vaccines, Discovers Vaccination Horrors and Goes Vaccine Free,” which advocates against vaccinating children, and reached out to YouTube to pull the programmatic placements. Their ads appeared on videos from channels including VAXXED TV, LarryCook333 (a proponent of StopMandatoryVaccinations.com), and iHealthTube, all of which YouTube has since demonetized, or prevented from running ads. - BuzzFeed One health tech company, Nomad Health, told BuzzFeed News that it ""does not support the anti-vaccination movement,"" and was ""not aware of our ads running alongside anti-vaccination videos."" The company said it would ""take action to prevent it from happening in the future.""
