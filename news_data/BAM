To say the least, that makes for a complicated investing environment. But RBC's stock pickers can boast of a strong track record so far.

Pattern operates nearly 4.4 gigawatts of mostly onshore wind capacity across the U.S., Canada and Japan, with about three-quarters of that owned in-house.

While that revamp helped the company’s shares surge in 2014-2015, they’ve since slumped after India’s shift to auctions for building wind projects increased competition and diluted Suzlon’s market share.The company’s bank facility ratings were cut to default by Care Ratings in April after it failed to meet payback obligations to its lenders. Any delay in repayments on the convertibles could further spook credit investors already reeling under a spate of defaults in the last year, from IL&FS Group to Dewan Housing Finance.Some traders in Suzlon’s bonds are pinning their hopes on a proposed acquisition of the embattled company by Toronto-based Brookfield Asset Management Inc.",BAM,en,The Economic Times India

Of this, at least 55% will have to come from public resources. Where’s the money?Those figures from an analysis by the Confederation of Indian Industry are the No. 1 challenge for Nirmala Sitharaman as the country’s new finance minister gets ready to present her first annual budget on Friday.While the scale of investment isn’t very different from what India spent in the past five years, the sorry state of corporate balance sheets makes it doubtful whether the private sector can put up its projected 45% share. Besides, the economy is in dire straits, regardless of the near-7% GDP growth portrayed by disputed government statistics.From consumption and private investment to exports, no cylinders are firing. Government spending is therefore the only hope. But Sitharaman is in a tight corner. It doesn’t help that revenue from a goods and services levy, India’s biggest tax innovation of recent times, continues to disappoint two years after its introduction by her predecessor, Arun Jaitley. 70068555 With health, education and other government services also needing more money, the scope to free up funds by cutting public expenditure simply doesn’t exist.",BAM,en,The Economic Times India

It was the bureaucracy in New Delhi that had misgivings about the then chief minister of Gujarat state, known for his highly centralized style of working.By now, the political capital has accepted Modi as the boss man. By contrast, the financial capital of Mumbai is anxious about further centralization of power. He’s already being referred to as India’s Xi Jinping. Given the difficulties that have beset China’s private sector under the president’s muscular leadership, that comparison isn’t exactly flattering.Mumbai’s trepidation, based on my recent conversations, arises from not knowing whether Modi will double down on his strongman image and chest-thumping nationalism in his second term, or give India’s institutions the freedom to tackle the economy’s central challenge: a lack of risk capital.",BAM,en,The Economic Times India

With RCom all but sure to head into insolvency proceedings, Ambani may be able to snag those same assets at a discount.In a last-minute rescue Monday, Mukesh stepped in to help younger brother Anil pay $80 million in dues to a local unit of Ericsson AB and avert a three-month jail sentence. On the same day, his Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. and Anil’s RCom terminated a 2017 deal that had helped the latter stave off bankruptcy.With that deal now off, RCom is likely to go into a court-led process that may provide Mukesh’s Jio another shot at buying up the carrier’s airwaves, towers and fiber. What’s more, he may get them for less than the 173 billion rupees ($2.5 billion) Jio agreed to pay a year ago given the weak financial health of India’s other telecom operators.Cheaper For Jio“Jio may have scrapped the asset purchase deal with RCom, but it cannot be ruled out that Jio will try and participate in the purchase,” under the bankruptcy process, said Saurav Kumar, a New Delhi-based partner at IndusLaw, an Indian law firm.",BAM,en,The Economic Times India

Spread across more than 36 acres, the museum, which officially opens in Doha on March 28, contains 560,000 square feet of galleries, conservation space, theaters, educational facilities, and restaurants. “As you walk through the different volumes, you never know what’s coming next,” Nouvel said in a statement. “The idea was to create contrasts, spring surprises.” One of those surprises will be the museum’s collection, which until now has been a tightly guarded secret. The Al-Thanis, the country’s ruling family, are some of the most prolific collectors in the world. Various branches of the clan own, among other works, The Card Players by Paul Cézanne, the 30-carat Shah Jahan Emerald, and a $142 million triptych by Francis Bacon. But more than 80 percent of the 94,000 square feet of gallery space will be devoted to the museum’s permanent collection, which focuses on “the environmental, cultural, and political ­history of Qatar.” In total, there are 11 interlinked galleries on a ­1.5-­kilometer-long “visitors circuit,” a tour through the museum that’s supposed to take about two hours.",BAM,en,Bloomberg
