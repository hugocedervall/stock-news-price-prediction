On Tuesday, Ofgem revealed a total investment package of at least £40 billion ($53.3 billion) for 2021-2026 with £30 billion of upfront funding available. Additional funding will be released for low-carbon projects presented as and when the network companies make the business case for it. Those companies have flagged £10 billion of such projects so far. The new investment package is part of Ofgem's second Revenue=Incentives+Innovation+Outputs framework (RIIO-2), set to be implemented in April 2021, which will guide transmission network investments from 2021-2026. It will see network charges in annual bills fall by £10 per household to £159, before increasing to current levels by 2026. The draft determinations, published in July were heavily criticized by the industry, which branded them “ perverse .” Those plans set upfront investment at £25 billion and permitted a lower level of return on investment.",NGG,en,Green Technology Media

Short sellers lost money on 78 out of the 100 stocks that make up the UK’s blue-chip index during November, according to new data from Ortex Analytics, as global equity markets rallied on the back of the US presidential result and a series of positive breakthroughs on Covid-19 vaccines. The hefty hit – which totalled GBP1.1 billion – torpedoed the GBP828 million gain made by short sellers in October. Last month’s losses were more than double the GBP420 million slide suffered in August by bearish managers.

The dedicated fast charging facility - which is capable of charging 36 EVs simultaneously, delivering around 200 miles of range in just 20 minutes - is envisaged as the first in a network of over 100 Electric Forecourts that are planned for the next five years as part of a £1bn investment drive. The initial site has been funded by GRIDSERVE, Hitachi Capital (UK) PLC, Innovate UK, and OZEV and forms part of the company's wider 'sun-to-wheel' strategy, which aims to integrate charge points with onsite solar panels and a network of hybrid solar farms. The UK's first subsidy-free solar farm in Clay Hill is paired with Braintree Electric Forecourt, providing 100 per cent renewable energy via the National Grid, while there is also a 6MWh battery onsite which helps balance the local energy grid and shift energy to periods when it is more valuable.",NGG,en,BusinessGreen

2020-11-16 10:30:00-05:00,Electric School Bus Fleets Test the US Vehicle-to-Grid Proposition,"There are good reasons for electric school buses to be the breakout vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology in the United States. At least, that’s how Duncan McIntyre, CEO of Highland Electric Transportation, sees it. McIntyre, who founded renewable energy procurement and analysis marketplace Alternex in 2011 and sold it to Edison International in 2015, started Highland Electric two years ago to build a “business entirely around the school bus electrification market.” The idea is to replace the up-front and ongoing costs of EV buses and charging infrastructure with a fixed annual fee, equal to or less than a school district’s current budget for owning, fueling and maintaining their existing diesel-fueled fleets. Highland finances the arrangement and recoups the investment by finding ways to earn money from the new fleet’s battery capacity when they’re not on the road. A major part of that equation relies on tapping their energy storage capacity for soaking up low-cost overnight or midday power — and more importantly, discharging it during grid-stressed evening peaks.","NG,NGG",en,Green Technology Media

But to make that promise a reality, the country may need to re-envision how to plan, and pay for, the transmission networks that will carry that multi-gigawatt resource to its shores. The government has big ambitions for offshore wind and has raised the country’s target from 30 gigawatts to 40 GW by 2030, in line with recommendations from its official climate advisors, the Committee on Climate Change. This is a step-change from the 10.4 GW currently installed in U.K. waters. But the government has realized that the current approach to designing and building offshore transmission — developed when the sector was nascent and expectations were for 10 GW to be built by 2030 — is outdated. In the U.K., project developers are required to finance and build transmission assets to bring the energy onshore, which at the time was a way of de-risking offshore wind projects.","NG,NGG",en,Green Technology Media
2020-11-04 08:00:00-05:00,"Long Island Could Save Money Replacing Old Peakers With Batteries, Study Finds","Long Island could become a hot spot for replacing old fossil-fueled power plants with batteries. The geography of the island constrains access to electricity; it relies on a fleet of aging oil- and gas-fired power plants to meet peak demand. That practice runs up against New York state's crackdown on its dirtiest power plants and its concerted push toward a clean grid by 2040. But Long Island could start shutting down fossil-fueled peakers and replacing them with batteries in the next few years and save customers money in the process, according to a new analysis from Strategen Consulting and the New York Battery and Energy Storage Technology Consortium (NY-BEST). Specifically, the study found that Long Island could get rid of 334 megawatts' worth of peakers today, swap in new battery plants instead, and save money for electricity customers while maintaining reliable power. Another 782 MW could retire by 2023 when new state nitrogen oxide (NOx) regulations kick in. Another tranche totaling more than 1 gigawatt could shut down in 2030, assuming New York fulfills its targets for solar and offshore wind construction by that time. ""The Long Island peakers, they’re old, dirty, and expensive,"" said Bill Acker, executive director of NY-BEST. ""Replacing them will save money and benefit the environment."" This finding reflects the material costs of maintaining an aging fleet that includes plants constructed as far back as the 1940s.","NG,NGG",en,Green Technology Media

The settlement resolves a probe by US authorities into the bank's role in underwriting three bond offerings in 2012 and 2013 that raised US$6.5 billion for Malaysia's government. Under the terms, Goldman has been slapped with a US$2.3 billion penalty and about US$600 million of disgorgement.

2020-10-22 09:00:00-05:00,"So, What Exactly Are Virtual Power Plants?","We live in an increasingly virtual world. You can hold virtual meetings with virtual friends using virtual reality systems hosted on virtual servers. And in energy circles, one of the biggest buzzwords in recent years is the virtual power plant, or VPP. The term first started to be bandied about in the 1990s. But VPPs have really taken off in the last 10 years, not just as a concept but as something that a growing number of energy companies are creating, using and commercializing. Here’s the real deal on this virtual energy phenomenon. Explain this ‘VPP’ thing… According to Germany’s Next Kraftwerke, one of the pioneers of modern VPPs, it’s “a network of decentralized, medium-scale power generating units such as wind farms, solar parks and combined heat and power units, as well as flexible power consumers and storage systems.” In practice, a VPP can be made up of multiple units of a single type of asset, such as a battery or a device in a demand response program, or a heterogeneous mix of assets.","NG,NGG",en,Green Technology Media

S&P Global Platts editors and analysts also discuss the latest Chinese actions on coal imports, Norwegian gas flows to Europe, and separate challenges faced by power markets in the UK and California. 1. Libya’s fragile oil return complicates market outlook What’s happening? Light sweet Libyan crude is starting to trickle through after an eight-month hiatus as rival groups agreed a tentative truce. The prospect of over 1 million b/d hitting the market in the coming months coincides with a brittle demand outlook amid a second wave of coronavirus infections. What’s next? Libya’s crude output is poised to rise to over 500,000 b/d soon following the restart of the 300,000 b/d Sharara field. But the return is likely to be gradual and prone to delays due to the shakiness of the peace deal and presence of armed groups at key oil infrastructure.","NG,NGG",en,Zero Hedge

Usually the goal is to verify a technology in the field before attempting broader deployment. Sometimes nothing follows the pilot. Vermont utility Green Mountain Power not only verified the efficacy of residential batteries for meeting grid needs, it saved its customers millions of dollars with them. Now, that program has been ratified by the state’s Public Utility Commission as a permanent residential storage tariff, which means battery installations, and utility savings, will continue to rise. At a time when forward-thinking companies are excited to erect networks of distributed batteries at some point in the next few years, Green Mountain Power represents something of anomaly. It already has not a couple hundred, but 2,567 utility-controlled Powerwall batteries sitting in customer homes, adding up to around 13 megawatts. “These things are functioning exactly as or better than we hoped,” said Josh Castonguay, vice president and chief innovation officer. “You’ve got an asset that’s improving reliability for the customer, and paying for itself, and providing a financial benefit for all of our customers.” By discharging those batteries during hours when the ISO New England grid faces monthly and annual peak demand, GMP reduces the payments it owes to the grid operator.","NG,NGG",en,Green Technology Media

The National Grid said on Oct. 14 that it was exploring various measures to create a buffer to avoid potential outages, like the one last summer that left 1 million homes without power . “We’re forecasting tight margins on the electricity system over the next few days owing to a number of factors including weather, import and export levels and availability of generators over periods of the day with higher demand,” the National Grid said in a statement. “Unusually low wind output coinciding with a number of generator outages means the cushion of spare capacity we operate the system with has been reduced.” Power outages in the UK are rare.

Located in Cornwall in the southwest of England, the 2.3-megawatt turbine will generate enough electricity for around 1,500 homes each year. But it will also test a solution to an issue that is increasingly affecting the U.K.’s clean energy transition: grid constraint. Cornwall is one of the sunniest and windiest regions of the U.K., and its high levels of renewable energy capacity have resulted in severe grid constraints. It is one of the reasons why no wind turbines have been installed there since 2016 — alongside planning restrictions and removal of government subsidy to the sector. Traditional network reinforcement is an expensive and lengthy process. However, utility Centrica has been leading trials to find more cost-effective solutions to grid constraints, that boost the business case for renewable energy generation and storage at the same time.","NG,NGG",en,Green Technology Media

In July Ofgem, the U.K's electricity and gas regulator, published its draft proposals for RIIO-2 — the price control framework for transmission networks during 2021-2026 — after lengthy consultations with the industry. The headline figure is a cap on equity returns of 3.95 percent. A separate framework for distribution networks is still in development. That 3.95 percent figure is down from the real-world returns on equity across the three operators — National Grid, SSE and SP Energy Networks — of between 8-10 percent, according to data from Ofgem. Ofgem insists the 3.95 percent cap is enough to attract investment to modernize the country's grid while also protecting consumers. But the proposals have been met with fierce opposition from the grid and gas network operators themselves. They claim such a low cap on equity returns will stall investment, put the country’s electrification agenda at risk, and even reduce reliability across the network.","NG,NGG",en,Green Technology Media

New data from London-based equity research firm Ortex Analytics shows almost three-quarters of total short losses in August came from big wagers against just five names: Ocado Group, InterContinental Hotels, International Consolidated Airlines Group, BHP and Pearson. Together, they accounted for a bruising GBP310 million loss out of a total hit of GBP420 million to hedge fund short sellers last month. As UK equities gained ground towards the end of the summer, hedge funds made gains from short positions in just a third of FTSE 100 names - 32 companies out of the total 100 in the index – as negative wagers in all sectors ultimately went awry. Hargreaves Lansdown proved the most profitable target for short sellers, delivering GBP26 million in August, followed by the National Grid (GBP17.6 million), HSBC (GBP16.2 million), and Royal Dutch Shell (GBP15.1 million).","NG,NGG",en,Hedgeweek

2020-08-30 18:01:45-05:00,"How Britain's grid became 'cleaner, cheaper, and harder to control' during the Covid-19 lockdown","Impact of lockdown offers glimpse of how a net zero energy system could operate in the future, highlighting need for more grid flexibility, study argues Lockdown measures taken to combat Covid-19 in March led to a much greener and cheaper electricity system in Britain in the weeks that followed, but at the same time the increased reliance on renewables made managing the grid far more challenging, offering a glimpse of the UK's future power requirements as the economy transitions towards net zero emissions. That is the conclusion of independent research released today by Imperial College London and energy firm Drax, which saw experts assess the tumultuous impact of the coronavirus crisis on Britain's electricity system from April to June 2020, a period characterised by near historically low levels of demand for power. As offices and factories shut up shop and millions of people were furloughed or working from home across the country during the second quarter of the year, electricity demand plummeted and renewable electricity took up its highest ever share of the energy mix, leading to record low CO2 emissions from the grid.","NG,NGG",en,BusinessGreen

In an open letter published yesterday, the energy regulator said it plans to review the actions National Grid ESO took to balance the energy system and maintain operations as the shuttering of businesses, offices and industry during lockdown saw power demand plummet in the UK, while output from renewables rose to record levels due to increased capacity and favourable weather conditions. Between March and July of this year, Ofgem said balancing costs were 39 per cent higher than usually expected at that time of year, as high levels of output from wind and solar combined with a dramatic decline in electricity demand spurred by the nationwide lockdown to halt the Covid-19 infection rate.","NG,NGG",en,BusinessGreen

The Murrow Anaerobic Digestion (AD) Plant in Cambridgeshire operated by Biocow Ltd breaks down cow manure and straw in sealed tanks to produce biomethane - also known as biogas - that delivers significant carbon emissions savings compared to fossil fuel natural gas. National Grid confirmed yesterday that a pipeline from the Murrow facility was directly connected to the Gas National Transmission System late last month, successfully enabling flows of up to 15,000 standard cubic meters per hour of the biogas into the grid. The facility is now set to provide enough biogas to meet the annual gas needs of 10 average UK households. Ian Radley, head of gas systems operations at National Grid, said that technologies supporting the use of hydrogen and biomethane would ""play a critical role in the journey to Britain achieving net zero"". ""We've collaborated closely with Biocow on this innovative project to ensure we met their needs and ultimately successfully connected their site to the National Transmission System; supporting the transition to a low carbon economy and paving the way for similar projects in the future,"" he said.","NG,NGG",en,BusinessGreen

The move brought the latest coal-free run to an end at 55 days, falling short of the 67 day record set earlier this year . The initial record run came to an end when Drax fired up some of its coal units for testing following maintenance work, and the latest run was forced to end in similarly unlikely circumstances, as the record-breaking heatwave led to reduced generation from gas power plants. High air temperatures can lead to reduced output from gas power plants as it requires more energy to compress hot humid air for use in power plant turbines. At the same time the hot, still weather conditions have led to low output from the UK's wind farms while a number of gas plants are currently offline for routine summer maintenance work.","NG,NGG",en,BusinessGreen

If the U.K. stays on track, there will be 11 million electric vehicles on U.K. roads by 2030, more than there are globally today. Residential gas boilers will be a thing of the past, with 8 million heat pumps installed to replace them. The U.K. will need to connect at least 40 gigawatts of new wind and solar in the 2020s, and an average of 3 gigawatts of wind and 1.4 gigawatts of solar every year from now till 2050, far above its current pace.

Construction of the world's longest subsea power cable has passed a major project milestone this week, after the deployment reached its halfway point. The North Sea Link, a joint venture between National Grid and its Norwegian counterpart Statnett, is to provide an interconnector cable that will link the UK and Norwegian electricity grids and enable the trading of excess renewable power between the two countries, enhancing both nations' decarbonisation efforts. National Grid confirmed today that the project was running on schedule, after an innovative floating platform was successfully built to lay the cable under a lake in southeast Norway. Once completed, the 720 kilometre interconnector will allow the UK to import enough Norwegian hydro energy to power up to 1.4 million homes, helping the country decarbonise and meet its 2050 net zero emissions target.","NG,NGG",en,BusinessGreen
2020-06-24 11:49:00-05:00,Bring-Your-Own-Batteries and EV Chargers: The Future of Distributed Energy Integration?,"Distributed energy resources (DERs) like rooftop solar, smart thermostats, behind-the-meter batteries, smart inverters and electric vehicle chargers have value for the customers installing them, and for the utilities seeing them proliferate across their distribution grids. But how can utilities and customers agree on sharing these potential values? In its latest DER research , Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables highlights how answering this questions is key to capturing the full value of behind-the-meter assets as they grow to gigawatt scale on U.S. power grids. So-called “ bring-your-own-device ” (BYOD) programs are one way to bridge this customer-utility divide. Utilities like BYOD because it avoids more expensive approaches, like rate-basing the costs of paying customers to install DERs. And customers seem to like them — at least, when they combine lucrative-enough incentives with a utility approach that doesn’t infringe on controlling their own home energy as they see fit. Brooklyn, N.Y.-based EnergyHub has focused on the BYOD approach for years now, from its early days as a software provider for smart thermostats and home energy controllers , to its more recent work on integrating solar inverters , batteries, electric vehicle chargers and grid-responsive water heaters .","NG,NGG",en,Green Technology (Feed)

In a briefing on trade policy released today, the Aldersgate Group - members of which include universities, NGOs, trade associations and businesses such as IKEA, KPMG, National Grid, John Lewis Tesco and Sky - sets out key policy recommendations it argues would help ""maximise the opportunities"" from free trade agreements. As well as calling for a green recovery package to help rebuild the UK economy after the pandemic, the Aldersgate Group said environmental and climate considerations should be at the heart of all future trade deals, and that trade barriers should be removed from low carbon goods and services.","NG,NGG",en,BusinessGreen
2020-06-23 08:21:00-05:00,Renewable Generators Are UK’s Latest Tool to Smooth Out Renewable Generation,"British wind farms are now solving the same problems they create for the grid operator, and lowering consumer bills in the process. With fewer and fewer fossil generators left in the U.K. generation mix, and more and more renewables, the network is under strain. But more than 100 large wind farms are now providing grid services to balance out the variable nature of renewables. A new ‘Power Available’ signal gives National Grid ESO eyes on all the participating wind farms, giving the grid operator visibility into how much they can contribute to providing grid stability. This was the final piece of the puzzle required to enable wind farms to participate in those flexibility markets. All this is part of National Grid ESO's plans to be able to support a fossil-fuel free network by 2025. The latest solution comes just in time. The grid operator has been forced to curtail wind power in huge volumes this summer, due to a lack of fossil fuel generators to provide essential flexibility. The cost of balancing the grid over summer has more than doubled this year to an anticipated £826 million ($1.03 billion).","NG,NGG",en,Green Technology (Feed)

2020-06-12 04:02:00-05:00,Flexibility Without A Capacity Market: What Texas Can Teach the UK,"Oil-heavy Texas could be a model for fully decarbonized energy systems around the world, at least in how it handles grid flexibility. While some other markets are paying for spare capacity to make sure the lights stay on, the Lone Star State’s energy-only market is doing fine as renewables soar. Viewing Texas’s ability to cope with rapidly growing levels of renewable generation, “I question whether a capacity market is the best way to bring forward flexibility,” said Chris Kimmett, director of the power grids business unit at Reactive Technologies, a U.K. cleantech firm. There is growing evidence, in the U.K. at least, that putting money into just-in-case capacity markets might not be necessary, he said. The British regulator Ofgem, in common with others in certain deregulated markets around the world, believes a capacity market should keep generation in reserve to deal with mismatches between electricity supply and demand. The U.K. capacity market provides support to legacy generation assets including coal-fired plants that would otherwise be at risk of closure.","NG,NGG",en,Green Technology (Feed)

Low electricity demand during the COVID-19 lockdown and ever-increasing wind and solar capacities have seen U.K. power prices collapse this year — and curtailment costs soar. A pair of public holidays in May exacerbated the problem, sending power demand even lower. National Grid ESO, the U.K. system operator, expects to spend an additional £500 million to balance the grid over the course of this summer, much of it payments to wind farms to stop generating. In total, National Grid expects to spend £826 million to balance the grid in the period May to August. A host of power companies, including major suppliers Centrica and E.ON, sent an open letter this week calling on National Grid to accelerate the deployment of smart EV charging infrastructure, energy storage and other flexibility services, allowing homeowners to make their own contribution to the energy transition and perhaps share in the profits along the way.","NG,NGG",en,Green Technology (Feed)

2020-05-29 17:34:00-05:00,National Grid Releases Latest Results on Distributed Solar Study,"Utility National Grid on Friday released results of the second phase of an extended solar interconnection study that has entangled nearly 1 gigawatt of projects in Massachusetts over the last year, and stymied development for some. Over 300 megawatts of projects may move forward without additional costs, the utility said, while another 90 megawatts of distributed solar projects will require developers to shoulder some transmission-level investments in order to connect projects to the grid. Those extra costs range from less than $1 million for a group of five projects up to a maximum of $75 million for another set of 12 projects that total 45.8 megawatts. National Grid estimated the latter group would need to wait five to seven years to interconnect while those updates happen. The significant costs and extended timeline will almost certainly push developers to drop projects in that 45.8-megawatt group, said Austin Perea, a senior solar analyst at Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables. Already, attrition has shrunk the second phase of the study from 565 megawatts last August to its current total of 391 megawatts. “[Those] projects are basically dead in the water given both the high costs associated with the upgrades, which would come out to about $1.50 per watt, and the 5 to 7-year timeframe,” said Perea. “But then again, only 50 megawatts being affected … has to be a relief to the industry.” Perea said the other projects requiring some investment may be able to move forward “if the distribution-level interconnect cost is not too onerous.” Friday's results are the second round so far in National Grid's so-called “cluster study,” named because the utility collectively analyzed a cluster of projects and their transmission impacts rather than examining projects individually.","NG,NGG",en,Green Technology (Feed)

A major cross-sector research initiative launched by the Carbon Trust is to investigate the ways a flexible energy system could advance the UK's transition towards net zero emissions. The project will use modelling, research, and stakeholder interviews to identify how different sources of flexibility services across the heat, power, and transportation sectors could reduce overall system costs for consumers. The Carbon Trust will lead the consortium, which includes distribution network operators, energy companies, professional institutions, and city governments, while Imperial College London will manage the project's modelling work. Conclusions expected for early 2021 aim to help policymakers and energy stakeholders carve out effective net zero road maps, the Carbon Trust said. ""Significant action and investment are required to transition our energy system to help achieve net zero emissions for the UK economy by 2050,"" said Andrew Lever, director at Carbon Trust.

As many as three-quarters of American households are unable to access rooftop solar — because they rent, or live in an apartment building, or a rooftop system is not affordable for them. Enter community solar: a simple, even elegant concept. Neighbors who are unable to build their own solar systems can join together, build a larger and more cost efficient installation nearby, and use the energy it provides to power their homes. Like many simple concepts, however, the details can quickly become overwhelming. In the first of a new series of explanatory articles, GTM will help you understand what community solar is and how it works. Is there a basic definition of community solar? There's no national standard for what a community solar program looks like, and there are plenty of disagreements about what makes a program most effective.

And if the scale of the current crisis has highlighted how reliant society is on certain critical services which have had to keep going at all costs - healthcare, refuse collections, food supplies, transport for key workers, to name just a few - it has also driven home the importance of reliable gas, electricity, and broadband provision. After all, for those companies which have been able to keep running, their staff are now largely working remotely from home, and video meetings, online shopping, and deliveries have quickly become the only option. As executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA) Fatih Birol pointed out last week, the coronavirus crisis has further highlighted just how much modern societies rely on electricity and energy services. ""The coronavirus crisis reminds us of electricity's indispensable role in our lives,"" he wrote in a blogpost . ""It's also providing insights into how that role is set to expand and evolve in the years and decades ahead.""

But there's still a long way to go. Latest figures from the Department for Transport have shown a steady rise in registrations of new ULEVs (Ultra Low Emission Vehicles), accounting for three per cent of all vehicles registered in the third quarter of 2019. This is a 39 per cent leap compared to the same period in 2018, but with EVs making up less than two per cent of all vehicles on the road, much more needs to be done to meet the government's target for at least 50 per cent of cars and 40 per cent of new vans to be ULEVs by 2030.","NGG,NG",en,BusinessGreen

If successful, the U.K. National Grid’s Distributed ReStart project should prove that assets such as wind, solar and battery plants can work alongside synchronous generators to restore power following a countrywide blackout. “The project is exploring how distributed energy resources can be used to restore power in the highly unlikely event of a total or partial shutdown of the national electricity transmission system,” said National Grid in a report published last month. “Past and current approaches rely on large power stations, but as the U.K. moves to cleaner, greener and more decentralized energy, new options must be developed. The enormous growth in DER presents an opportunity to develop a radically different approach to system restoration.” Distributed ReStart was launched in January 2019 and is set to run to March 2022, with £10.","NGG,NG",en,Green Technology

The grid edge space witnessed major transformations in 2019 right up through the end of Q4. In a new report , Wood Mackenzie grid edge analysts reflect on key events in the last months of 2019. Some of the highlights: Progress in transportation electrification A total of 4.8 million electric vehicle charging points were installed globally in 2019, Wood Mackenzie found in Q4, with another 18.3 million EV charging points to be installed globally by 2025. By then, more than 38 million EVs are expected to be on the road worldwide. China, North America and Europe will continue to lead electrification of transportation, with China capturing around half the market by 2025.

Now, a potentially significant opportunity is coming into focus for them: home battery systems. 2019 was a big year for both residential solar and home storage in the U.S. Power shutoffs in California and demand pull-in from the Investment Tax Credit helped both industries log new records. Yet while much of the attention on solar-plus-storage has focused on leading national installers — SunPower unveiled its in-house residential storage product in September — conversations with local solar installers across the country show that, heading into 2020, interest in storage is trickling into many more sales conversations. It’s a trend that underscores the growing interconnect between the two sectors. Rooftop solar remains a vastly larger market than home storage systems. U.S. homes added about 1.9 gigawatts of solar capacity through the first three quarters of 2019, compared to just 98.3 megawatts of storage.","NGG,NG",en,Green Technology

And it happened with Northeastern states — traditionally powerhouses in the sector — completely absent from a ranking of the top five state markets. California still accounted for about 40 percent of all installations in Q3. But the Northeast's grip on residential solar waned, with other regions rising. Record quarters in 15 states were enough to break another record at the national level, with the U.S. adding 712 megawatts of new residential systems, an increase of 8 percent from the same period last year. Substantial growth occurred in mainstays like California as well as in budding state markets such as Wyoming and Iowa. While solar success spread throughout the U.S., though, the Northeast faced headwinds. Several states kept installation volumes steady, where in the past they'd shown growth. “Higher levels of saturation and the resulting steep customer-acquisition costs have slowed installation volumes since peak installation years, as the market grows past early-adopter consumers,” write WoodMac analysts of the region.","NGG,NG",en,Green Technology

Between 2020 and 2022 the Italian group will invest €11.5 billion ($ billion) in additional renewable capacity, which it expects to equate to another 14.1 gigawatts of assets by the end that period, building on its existing 46-gigawatt renewables fleet, a large chunk of which is hydroelectric capacity. The planned investment into renewables is broken into three groups. The replacement of fossil fuel generation in Spain, Italy and Chile will account for 5.4 gigawatts. Another 5.1 gigawatts will be developed in Brazil and the U.S. to fulfill power purchase agreements, many with commercial and industrial customers. And 3.6 gigawatts will be developed in new and emerging markets for the company. According to Enel, 60 percent of this new capacity is “secured” with the remainder to be drawn from its 20-gigawatt pipeline. Enel's coal capacity will be reduced 61 percent during the period.","NGG,NG",en,Green Technology

2019-11-25 09:22:03-05:00,Lightsource BP Makes Solar Pay At Night,"An overnight trial in the U.K. has seen a solar power plant successfully provide optimization services to the broader grid during nighttime hours, clearing the way for solar projects to participate in a new reactive power support mechanism and benefit from the associated revenue. Lightsource BP modified the inverters on its 4-megawatt St Francis solar farm in the southeast of England, allowing the inverters to receive power from the grid and feed it back with the voltage optimized. It's the first time a solar plant has been used for this purpose in the U.K. The test, conducted in early November, is part of the Power Potential project, a joint effort by National Grid ESO, the country’s system operator, and UK Power Networks (UKPN), the distribution network operator in the southeast. The pair estimate that such grid services could save the system £400 million ($515 million) by 2050, and enable the equivalent of another 4 gigawatts of generating capacity by making the most efficient use of the grid network.","NGG,NG",en,Green Technology

The government investigation into the cause of an Aug. 9 blackout that affected around a million British customers is on ice pending the outcome of national elections on Dec. 12, with insiders saying it likely won’t get published until next year. A spokesman confirmed that U.K. electricity system operator National Grid ESO had not made any changes to its operating procedures following the outage. “This has happened only three times in 30 years, and Great Britain has statistically one of the most reliable energy networks not only in Europe, but anywhere in the world,” said Ben Davis, external affairs manager. According to a detailed timeline put together by National Grid ESO, a lightning strike on a transmission circuit north of London caused the almost simultaneous shutdown of Hornsea One, which is the world’s largest operating offshore wind farm, and Little Barford gas station.","NGG,NG",en,Green Technology

2019-11-15 17:33:28-05:00,National Grid: 300 MW of Halted Solar Can Move Forward With ‘No Cost’,"National Grid on Friday released results for the first part of an interconnection study that put nearly 1 gigawatt of Massachusetts solar projects on hold. Sixty-eight projects can move forward with no added transmission cost, the utility said. Just a single project out of the 320 megawatts studied in Part 1 of the so-called “ cluster study ” will have to pay for a transmission upgrade, the costs of which National Grid is still estimating. The results mean that a large chunk of projects out of the 1-gigawatt study, most of which are community solar, can progress. The utility initiated its cluster study in May, identifying nearly a gigawatt of projects that it said required transmission-level impact analysis. The first phase was designed to study projects in more advanced stages of development. After application attrition, that portion dropped from 372 megawatts to the 320 megawatts for which National Grid reported results on Friday. Though the results could allay some developer concerns, solar advocates say the study has already been the source of significant strain. “The process has caused a lot of anxiety and hardship for the development community for the past six months,” said Jeremy McDiarmid, vice president of policy and government affairs at the Northeast Clean Energy Council. “The end result … allows many developers to have a little bit of relief, but I also want to make sure we talk a little bit about the big picture and what this signifies for development in the Northeast going forward.” “I think you’re going to see a lot more studies of this type across the region, that are going to expose this challenge that if we want to have the level of clean energy investment that we’re asking for and we need, we’re going to have to build a system that can accommodate it,” McDiarmid added.","NGG,NG",en,Green Technology
2019-11-14 16:56:50-05:00,Solar Developers Smell Trouble on Long Island as Offshore Wind Arrives,"Long Island was once the “backbone” of New York’s solar industry, according to Steven Engelmann, business development director at New York-based EnterSolar. The island accounts for nearly a third of the state’s total installations to date. More recently, though, Engelmann says the region’s distributed solar market has fallen off “a cliff” due to constraints on the commercial solar market, which have only recently lifted. Total solar installations on Long Island dropped from 111.7 megawatts in 2016, to 83.2 megawatts the following year, and then 66.2 megawatts in 2018, according to numbers from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority. Solar advocates like Engelmann blame two factors for the drop: decreasing incentives from a rebate program called NY-Sun and the transition to the Value of Distributed Energy Resources (VDER) tariff, which appraises projects based on stacking of benefits like location-based price. The industry claimed problems with VDER from its early stages, arguing the stack doesn’t fully value all that distributed resources offer.","NGG,NG",en,Green Technology
