That record comes just two years after it became the first company to break the $1 trillion mark. Not bad for an outfit that started in a garage in California. Apple is the poster child for the ""large-cap"" (short for ""large-capitalization"") category of stocks — enormous companies that investors value highly. On the more conservative side of the investment landscape, they're famed for providing stable returns with relatively low risk. So how can you get in on the action? From market cap valuation to risk assessment, here's what you need to know about large-cap stocks. What is market capitalization? But first, a quick primer. Market capitalization (""market cap"" for short) is the total value of all a company's stock. It's calculated by multiplying all of the firm's outstanding shares — the ones trading on the stock market — by the current price of each share.","GOOGL,KO",en,Business Insider

Aunque parezca mentira, la Coca-Cola también se puede utilizar para quitar manchas de la ropa . Gracias al ácido fósforico y al ácido carbónico de la bebida, actúa como quitamanchas. No debes echar el refresco directamente en la ropa, sino que hay que verter un poco en la lavadora junto al detergente y una vez se acabe el lavado las manchas desaparecerán. También se puede eliminar el óxido y limpiar sartenes y cazuelas quemadas . Hay lugares como estanterías metálicas o la bañera que se pueden oxidar.

As Salesforce grew in popularity, more companies adopted that same model of selling software on a monthly, per user, or usage basis, a model often called software-as-a-service or SaaS. While software engineers are key to actually building these cloud-based products, customer facing roles like sales, marketing, and business development are equally important to companies' success. So what do top cloud software companies like Salesforce, Slack, Atlassian, and others pay their top non-tech workers? Federal data gives some insight: American companies have to disclose salaries when they apply for visas for current or prospective foreign workers. The Office of Foreign Labor Certification, which collects and processes those applications, publishes the salaries every year.

Purchase this report. To check to see if you already have access to Business Insider Intelligence through your company, click here. Esports and gaming have burst into the mainstream in recent years, transforming from a vibrant niche to a central form of entertainment around the world. While esports may have once stood for a subset of sports culture, it has grown into a full industry in its own right. That shift has been powered by championing from mainstream celebrities like Michael Jordan, Drake, and DJ Marshmello, an increasing amount of coverage from traditional outlets like ESPN, and, at least in part, the breakneck rise of Fortnite. As competitive gaming cements itself in the popular culture, global investors, brands, media outlets, and consumers are all paying attention. Total esports viewership is expected to grow at a 9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2019 and 2023, up from 454 million in 2019 to 646 million in 2023, per Business Insider Intelligence estimates.","KO,KMB",en,Business Insider

""It's gone from [brands] being a year and a half ago, 'Should we be there and what is this thing?', to as it's grown and it's diversified its audience and certainly diversified content, now it's, 'Ok we need to be here,'"" said Blake Chandlee, TikTok's vice president of global business solutions. He was speaking with Business Insider's senior media editor Nathan McAlone at the Business Insider Global Trends Festival on Tuesday. TikTok launched its suite of advertising tools out of beta in July with an eye toward courting small and mid-sized businesses. But historically its primary tools for marketers, including a self-serve ad platform and creator marketplace , have mostly drawn in test budgets from brands. But TikTok may begin to win larger budgets as its user base and ad tools continue to expand. And brands are asking TikTok's global business solutions team specific questions about its marketing capabilities as they consider investing in the platform, Chandlee said.",KO,en,Business Insider

After his father suffered a heart attack in 2017, Cohen made a series of tough calls to spend more time with him: scrapping plans to take Chewy public, selling the company for $3.4 billion, and resigning as CEO the following year. Cohen broke with convention again by investing the vast majority of his wealth in two stocks , Apple and Wells Fargo, and later placing a contrarian bet on ailing video-game retailer GameStop. The entrepreneur attributes his independent streak to the ""two biggest influences on my professional life"": his father, Ted Cohen, who passed away last December, and Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO. ""Something critical that I learned from my dad and Warren Buffett was the ability to separate myself from the herd and think independently,"" Cohen told Business Insider this week. The pair's teachings allow him to ""block out the noise, develop my own point of view, and not be influenced by daily headlines or the consensus or what's in style."" For example, many people initially doubted Chewy would be able to ship 30-pound bags of pet food to customers and make any money. ""In the early years, few investors thought Chewy was a good idea,"" Cohen said. ""I struck out raising capital over 100 times."" Ignoring the skeptics, as well as avoiding distractions and saying ""no"" to all but the best opportunities, enabled Cohen to focus on the things most critical to Chewy's success: competitive prices, compelling products, fast shipping, and personalized customer service.",KO,en,Business Insider

Newly released economic data including expanding global purchasing-manager indexes, rising retail sales in the US and Europe, increasing global trade volume, and decreasing inventory levels are all pointing to an ongoing economic rebound, Morgan Stanley said in a Friday research note. However, it is the strength of the US consumer that cements the equity strategy team's view on the ""intact"" recovery, wrote strategist Adam Virgadamo, noting that ""US household personal income already reached 2% above pre-COVID levels in August."" Further driving the recovery will be the efficacy data from three coronavirus vaccine candidates in November. Under ""operation warp speed,"" the US government has purchased hundreds of millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses from Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Sanofi/GSK, and Novavax.

But when Coca-Cola announced a spiked version in July, it marked the beverage giant's first foray into alcohol in decades. Coke knew how to get new drinks into the soda aisles at grocers, but it had less experience navigating the beer section or liquor stores.

The companies announced their agreement Tuesday, which will allow Molson Coors to produce and distribute four flavors of the hard seltzer, including Strawberry Guava and Tropical Mango, starting in 2021. Neither company is a stranger to partnerships, having struck distribution agreements with beverage incubators as well as large peers such as Heineken and Monster in recent years. Under the deal, Molson will scale up Topo Chico hard seltzer in the US, focusing first on areas of the country where its non-alcoholic cousin is already well-known.",KO,en,Business Insider

Of course, the U.S. recycling system had been a mess for far longer — seeing as the country never fully developed the infrastructure to recycle anywhere near the amount of plastic waste it produces. Indeed, only 8.4 percent of all the plastic produced in 2017 eventually got recycled, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency . But a new agreement announced last week at Circularity 20, GreenBiz Group’s virtual conference on the circular economy, has the potential to change that: The U.S. Plastics Pact. This new initiative is a collaborative project launched by the Recycling Partnership and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) that aims to redesign the way the United States uses plastics so that they don't become waste in the first place.",KO,en,GreenBiz

Media reports suggest that two, five and 30-year Green sales will thus follow in due course. Kukies also suggested that the planned 10-year sale would be priced in line with outstanding conventional bonds, without specifying which issue would be ""twinned"" with a green equivalent.

Y cada vez es más pequeño. En una sociedad que ha evolucionado sin respiro en las últimas décadas, las marcas, incluso las que parecen más sólidas, están expuestas a una caducidad inmediata si no avanzan al ritmo de ese cambio. Un informe del profesor de Yale Richard Foster puso cifras a ese vértigo desatado: si en 1958 la longevidad media de las empresas del S&P500 (las mayores cotizadas de EE.UU.) era de 61 años, en 1980 se había reducido a 25 y había caído hasta los 18 en la segunda década del sigloXXI. Un repaso al tradicional ranking «BrandZ 2020» de Kantar y WPP, recientemente publicado, confirma que, ahora más que nunca, la tecnología marca el camino. Y se recorre en un sprint permanente en el que EE.UU. lidera el pelotón, el aliento del perseguidor chino cada vez se siente más cerca y Europa resuella descolgada, sin protagonismo. En este ranking, que valora los activos y la percepción del consumidor para fijar las cien marcas globales más valiosas, las «big tech» dominan de forma apabullante la «zona noble» (Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google y Visa copan el «top 5»), representando un 37% del valor de marca total del «top 100» y creciendo a ritmos superiores al 10% anual.",KO,es,ABC Spain

There was a time when the major players in the plastics industry — the big resin producers primarily — promoted plastics’ benefits in our lives with TV ads and slogans, such as “Plastic Makes It Possible” and “We don’t make the products you buy — we make the products you buy better.” Somewhere along the line that messaging stopped and a void was created. You know what happens when there’s void? Something comes along to fill it. That something turned out to be the many activist groups who put plastics in their sights, targeting the material through the use of hard-hitting campaigns. And those groups know how to create a message that resonates with consumers. Activist groups such as Greenpeace and As You Sow launched campaigns to pressure large consumer goods companies (CPGs) and brand owners such as Kraft, Mondelez, McDonalds, and Starbucks to ditch plastics.",KO,en,PlasticsToday

The lab-engineered enzyme molecules can biologically break down PET plastic waste into its original components which can then be rebuilt afresh into new products, in a process that can be repeated infinitiely, claims the study, which was published yesterday in the scientific journal Nature . The solution holds particular promise for coloured, opaque and multilayered PET plastic products, which it claims are difficult to recycle via traditional methods as they degrade rapidly, meaning they often end up incinerated or landfilled after only a few cycles. Yet the newly-developed enzyme solution, meanwhile, can break down 90 per cent of PET waste in just 10 hours, and a demonstrator plant for the technology is sheduled to be running in Lyon by as soon as next year, according to the researchers.",KO,en,BusinessGreen

Making a really big deal,"By Tara LachapelleHe’s making a list and checking it twice, but can’t find a takeover target that’s nice.Warren Buffett is the jolly man of the stock market. However, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has also been a bit of a Scrooge this year, as he continues to pass up acquisitions and instead hoard his money. The billionaire has long been seeking a really big deal on which to spend some of his company’s $128 billion of cash, except everything is overpriced in his view. To make matters more frustrating, Berkshire’s own shares are lagging behind the broader U.S. market by the most since 2009.While 2019 wasn’t Buffett’s worst year, it was surely one of his dullest. With Berkshire’s cash pile reaching new heights, Buffett has said that just the thought of taking over another company — he’s acquired nearly 200 during his career — causes his heart “to beat faster.” Instead, this chart of Berkshire’s stock performance looks like it’s almost flat-lining:72943352 Berkshire shares are on track to end the year up a modest 11%, trailing the S&P 500 index by 20 percentage points.",KO,en,The Economic Times India

An effort to lock down the vaping crisis had actually sent people out to stock up. This sales data, which comes from marijuana retail shops, shows that in Washington, California, and Colorado, regions that have instituted some vape bans, sales of vape pens have been sliding since August.

But a deep dive into Berkshire Hathaway's equity holdings reveals a more complicated picture. Berkshire Hathaway held positions in 48 separate stocks as of Sept. 30, according to the most recent regulatory filing (Nov. 14) with the Securities and Exchange Commission - up from 47 during the second quarter of this year. But the portfolio of ""Buffett stocks"" isn't as diversified as the number might suggest. In some cases, BRK.B holds more than one share class in the same company. Also, some holdings are immaterial leftovers from earlier bets that the Oracle of Omaha has mostly exited, just not completely. In fact, Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio is actually pretty concentrated. The top six holdings account for almost 70% of the portfolio's total value. The top 10 positions comprise a little more than 80%.",KO,en,Kiplinger Washington Editors

Although Fanta is now well known for its bright colors and bold flavors, it was originally made from food scraps.

Modern-day Fanta evolved from the Fanta that was re-introduced to Italy in 1955. This Fanta was produced from local produce rather than food scraps. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. Following is a transcript of the video. This is Fanta, one of the most popular soft drinks in the world. It's easily identifiable by its bright colors and bold advertisements, which often feature a group of diverse people dancing to loud, upbeat music. The brand presents itself as multicultural and fun-loving and lures consumers in with the promise of fresh, bold flavors. But would you believe the first bottle of Fanta was made from food scraps?

The goal is stated in the name of the initiative—Every Bottle Back—that will support the circular plastics economy by reinforcing to consumers the value of their 100% recyclable plastic bottles and caps and ensuring they don’t end up as waste in oceans, rivers or landfills, said the announcement.

2019-11-01 04:32:24-05:00,This Harvard scientist has a plan to solve the mysterious vaping illness,"A mysterious illness has killed 37 people and severely damaged the lungs of roughly 2,000 people. The disease will continue to spread, because no one seems to know what exactly is causing it. Part of the problem may stem from asking the wrong questions. A new online survey from researchers at Harvard hopes to fix that. The project, called YouVape , serves two purposes: to let people check to see if they have symptoms of vaping-related pulmonary disease and to give researchers access to more specific information around patient symptoms and what they vape. This will not only yield more about where the disease is popping up, but potentially what’s causing it. Yulin Hswen, a researcher based at the Harvard-affiliated Boston Children’s Hospital who’s behind the YouVape project, first took an interest in the subject because of the fanatical blogs around vaping. It was not because she suspected it might cause a public health crisis. “I didn’t see that coming,” she says. So when the infectious disease tracking tool she works on called HealthMap registered a health alert from Wisconsin’s Health Department about eight lung injury cases related to vaping in July, she didn’t think too much of it.",KO,en,Fast Company

Mule (pronounced Moo-LAY), a morning radio host in Rochester, N.Y., pops into his local grocery store daily for some Vietnamese spring rolls, a rotisserie chicken, or just a coffee and some chitchat with Jimmy, his pal in the produce department. The broadcaster likes the place so much he hired the supermarket to cater his wedding. He often takes out-of-town guests on a tour of the place. “They say, ‘It’s a goddamn grocery store, how good could it be?’ ” he says. “But I say it’s the best shopping experience you’ve ever had.” Mule’s retail nirvana is Wegmans Food Markets. If you haven’t heard of it, you’re not alone. The privately held, family-run chain based in Rochester has only 98 stores scattered across six eastern states, fewer than Walmart operates in New York state alone.

Buffett continued to bid up bank shares, making his Omaha-based firm a major shareholder in four of the five largest US banks. This includes increasing stakes in JP Morgan and Bank of America during the last three months of the year. Buffett also boosted his stakes in regional lenders like PNC Financial Services Group and US Bancorp which may have been plays on consolidation in the industry (a trend that is starting to play out following the recent BB&T-Suntrust deal ).

The big news catalyst overnight hit late on Monday night following a report that Trump was considering pushing back the deadline for imposition of higher tariffs on Chinese imports by 60 days, after earlier telling reporters that trade talks are ""going along very well"" and, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in China, investors had been daring to hope for good news. And while traders were happy to bid up risk assets for one more day on a variation of the same positive news that has hit wires - or Trump's twitter feed - for the past two months, they ignored a tweet from the editor in chief of China's Global Times who said that ""speculations of trade negotiations will be extended are inaccurate.""

Because it's the day we finally learned - thanks to a repoert in the Wall Street Journal - that Jeff Bezos (and, presumably, his investors) tolerance for loss-making businesses does have its limits. According to emails obtained by the paper, Amazon-owned Whole Foods Market raised prices this month on dozens of items ranging from Dr. Bronner’s soaps to Häagen-Dazs ice cream. These prices hikes followed increases on another 55 items, including crackers, olives and cookies, according to an email from December. The reason for the price hikes? As we have previously reported , Clorox, Coca-Cola and Mondelez are just a few of the producers of consumer products, snack foods and beverages who were preparing to raise prices. According to figures cited by WSJ, nearly half of 52 consumer-goods manufacturers surveyed recently by consulting firm Acosta raised prices last year. The hikes, we argued at the time, would blindside consumers who have grown accustomed to sub-2% inflation in a world where the Phillips Curve has broken down.",KO,en,Zero Hedge

And apparently, millennials who use the RobinHood free stock-trading app have taken this advice to heart. According to Business Insider , shares of Aurora Cannabis, the Canadian cannabis producer, are now more popular among the app's (mostly millennial) users than Apple. That's not to say millennials aren't absolutely enamored with Apple products (they are). But the bubbly ""green rush"" into marijuana stocks is more in keeping with the get-rich-quick ethos favored by their generation than the traditional buy-and-hold approach associated with owning a blue-chip stock. Aurora Cannabis is now held by 247,517 Robinhood users, up more than 20,000 from last week. The marijuana stock outranked all the others on the app, including Apple, which had maintained its top-ranking position since the week of November 8.
