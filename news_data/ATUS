The pandemic has accelerated cord cutting as the number of streaming services grows while advertisers cut linear TV budgets and rework big commitments with networks like NBCUniversal, Disney, and ViacomCBS. And AT&T — one of the biggest sellers of targeted, or so-called addressable advertising — is reportedly mulling spinning off its pay-TV service DirecTV and digital ad firm Xandr that was supposed to help it along. Addressable advertising has always represented a small amount of TV inventory, but the coronavirus has exposed some of its pitfalls like high ad prices, a lack of measurement standards, and growing competition from streaming TV companies. When the coronavirus shut down production schedules and sports, advertisers pulled their addressable campaigns along with national ad spend, said Matt Kramer, managing director of advanced advertising at Omnicom Media Group.",ATUS,en,Business Insider

The CBRS spectrum — also sought after by mobile network operators AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile — would enable the cable operators to handle a greater portion of MVNO traffic on standalone networks. Now that Cox announced its reentry into the mobile market, all three cable operators are looking to expand MVNO services, which have proven to be relatively resilient business segments amid the current economic downturn. Purchasing CBRS spectrum would enable Cox, Comcast, and Charter to strategically deploy standalone mobile networks to realize cost savings in their hybrid MVNO models. When they launched, cable MVNOs aimed to realize cost savings by first steering customers toward their wired cable networks, and then supplementing coverage with wireless carrier partnerships.
