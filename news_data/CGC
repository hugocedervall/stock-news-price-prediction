While Biden has stopped short of endorsing federal legalization, both he and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, have campaigned on decriminalizing marijuana .

The campaign said Biden's administration would move cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substance Act (CSA) to Schedule II, which would allow more researchers to study the drug's impacts as both a medicine and a consumer product. On top of that, the Biden administration has said it will back legislation to expunge the records of those convicted for marijuana-related crimes. Biden also supports cannabis legalization for medical uses and wants to allow states to legalize recreational cannabis and create commercial markets without federal interference.

For Linton, the CBD craze will blow over, but the hemp plant is here to stay. And he doesn’t intend to be left behind. Earlier this year, Linton launched Collective Growth Corp (NASDAQ: CGROW), a special-purpose acquisition company that went public on the Nadaq exchange in May, and aims to exploit the potential of hemp, seeking to disrupt many industries that go well-beyond medical and recreational cannabis. “The biggest disruption opportunity related to cannabis plants at large is to use the whole plant and hemp for what it can do.",CGC,en,Benzinga

Despite record legal cannabis sales in major markets (which can be attributed to the pandemic) cannabis producers have had to grapple with an uncomfortable truth: there is too much weed . This fact remains true for both Canadian and U.S. companies, even though cannabis remains federally illegal in the latter. Predictably, the oversupply of cannabis and hemp has created downward pressure on prices , a problem for companies in the business of selling cannabis-based products. “We’re seeing lower grade flower commoditized, the price of distillate commoditized, and it puts even more strain on processors that are not the most efficient,” said Paul Pedersen, co-founder and CEO of Nextleaf Solutions (OTCQB: OILFF ). “Because as the price of the commodity you’re selling comes down, you’ve got to be able to lean on price and efficiency.” This is why, as Pedersen describes it, the future of the cannabis industry is not a question of who can grow the most, sell the most, or even make the best product.",CGC,en,Benzinga

The U.K. relaxed its rules for the import of medical marijuana and derivate products, promising “[p]atients prescribed cannabis-based medicines will be able to get their treatment in days rather than months.” In Mexico, three Senate commissions passed a bill to legalize cannabis for all of its uses in a coordinated effort. The legislation will now be subject to vote in the full Senate. If approved it will move to the last instance: the lower legislative chamber. The World Health Organization, which supposed to hold a vote on cannabis scheduling, decided to postpone the decision until December. Alfredo Pascual of MJBizDaily, who keeps a close eye on all international developments, explained “The delay underscores the difficulty in reaching agreements on cannabis policy on a level that transcends national borders.” In his view, “Given the current level of disagreement, postponing the vote was the best outcome for the recommendations to stand any chance of approval.” Back in the U.S., South by Southwest, which was offering a cannabusiness track again this year, was cancelled due to concerns over COVID-19.

It seems fair to say that to this point the sector has rewarded those who invested early, however it has generally frustrated efforts by investors to get involved more recently. With significant volatility in share prices, there is more to the returns of the sector for investors, namely the revenues from lending shares to short sellers. One of the best examples is Tilray, which has been one of the highest revenue generating US equities since its IPO in July 2018. Since going public, shares of TLRY have generated $148m in revenue, contributing 2.9% of all North American equity lending revenue.

We'll also look at the positive impact an increase in same-store sales could have on the company going forward. Product returns One of the major concerns I have for Canopy Growth is its inability to accurately identify demand trends, which in the last quarter came back to bite them, as it had product returns of just under $27 million, much of that coming from a lack of demand for its oil products. I don't think that's only from misreading demand, but from misreading the trend itself. It remains to be seen if oils will be the positive catalyst some following the industry, and some in the industry itself, have believed it would be.

The passage of the 2018 Agriculture Improvement Act (farm bill) legalized hemp production setting the market up for a strong sales ramp. Hemp contains less than 0.3% of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), whereas marijuana contains up to 30% of the psychoactive compound. CBD is increasingly presumed to contain properties for wellness and pain management increasing the attractiveness of hemp-infused CBD products, but the U.S. FDA has other thoughts. The FDA has questioned the lack of safety research on CBD products and placed into question the approval of edibles. In addition, CBD products aren’t allowed to advertise any medical benefits from the products such as pain relief. For this reason, the large proclamations for huge CBD sales have taken a hit.

That was followed by the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill which federally legalized hemp in the United States for the first time in seven decades.

Canopy Growth Corp (NYSE: CGC ) released second-quarter financial results that sent the stock trading lower last week. To better understand what’s going on, Benzinga reached out to CEO Mark Zekulin, who became the company’s public face after Bruce Linton stepped down in July . The CEO is enthusiastic about Canopy's future and the quarterly results are a natural setback as the legal cannabis market develops. What's Wall Street Missing? Canopy’s shares have lost roughy 47% percent of their value year-to-date. While Zekulin said he recognizes the weaker points in the cannabis company's financials, he also highlighted some positive ones. On the negative side, the CEO acknowledged that “one obvious bad [factor] is that we took a number of return and inventory provisions to address the fact that oils and soft gels in the rec market are not selling as fast as we expected. That was a large number and had a cascading impact throughout all the financials.” Without minimizing this, the Zekulin went into the positive aspects of Canopy's position. “On a line-by-line basis, particularly in light of what we're seeing our competitors do, and in terms of the Canadian market, I'm actually quite happy with our performance,” he told Benzinga.",CGC,en,Benzinga

Consequently, the shift towards different cannabis-based products led to a major decline in flower sales.

After California's ruling, numerous states began to follow suit and also legalized medical cannabis. Then in 2012, the cannabis industry was completely reshaped after Colorado and Washington both legalized recreational cannabis.

Cannabis projections often fall far short of actual sales growth. Cannabis-infused beverages looks to be next area of explosive upside. Beverage and cannabis companies striking deals to gain market access. New technologies could snag significant market share. Once viewed as wild conjecture for the future of cannabis markets, forecasts in 2015 fell severely short of actuality.

Under international regulations, cannabis is considered an illicit drug, yet, a handful of countries have already moved to legalize cannabis on some level. Cannabis is a family of plants that falls under two primary classifications: Indica and Sativa. The plant is also comprised of two counterparts; marijuana and hemp. Although the two derivatives widely differ in their biological makeup, the two still offer similar therapeutic effects. Marijuana can fall under both the Indica or Sativa family, while hemp is categorized solely into the Sativa family. However, marijuana provides consumers with psychoactive effects because of its high THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, content. On the other hand, hemp does not cause psychoactive effects because it is mainly comprised of CBD or cannabidiol. As such, the potent THC concentration within the marijuana plant is the major reason why cannabis is strictly enforced around the globe.",CGC,en,Benzinga

2019-04-01 08:00:00-05:00,Cannabis Continues to Garner Attention with the Rapid Expansion of CBD Products,"NEW YORK , April 1, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Cannabis has become one of the most controversial topics on many countries' political agendas. Cannabis is still internationally illegal under regulatory statutes, but clinical trials and research have led countries to explore opportunities within the medical cannabis market. However, the recreational market is still widely being heavily enforced. Nonetheless, certain regions have moved to decriminalize, or even fully legalize, recreational cannabis use. Unlike marijuana, hemp's main component is CBD. While THC provides psychoactive effects to consumers, CBD does not induce psychoactive effects, but provide a therapeutic and relaxing effect akin to that of THC. Furthermore, because CBD does not provide any psychoactive effects, many countries have allowed personal use of the CBD as long as it contains less than 0.3% THC. According to data compiled by Hemp Business Journal, a division of New Frontier Data, the total sales for the U.S. hemp industry totaled USD 820 Million and is expected to grow to reach USD 1.9 Billion by 2022.",CGC,en,Benzinga

On the other hand, the state of New Jersey cancelled its vote on a bill that would legalize recreational cannabis due to a lack of support from legislators. “There have been so many advancements in cannabis, that many in the industry just feel like there will be no barriers in the way,” Debra Borchard, CEO of Green Market Report, told Benzinga. “However, New Jersey was a good reminder that there are still lots of people with concerns. It's still an infant industry with a long way to go.” Commenting on the SAFE Banking Act, Kyle Detwiler, CEO of Northern Swan Holdings said, “This is a great step forward for the industry as a whole, and this should improve efficiency and worker safety… We hope this is a stepping stone towards full legalization which will allow greater competition, product innovation and patient health.” The Cannabis Capital Conference is coming back to Toronto April 17-18!",CGC,en,Benzinga
