In an update to its climate strategy released today , the company said it would support existing thermal coal customers, but would do so alongside ""a commitment to reduce our exposure to zero by 2030"". As such, the bank has now committed to not establish relationships with new thermal coal customers; limit support for thermal coal mines or projects to existing basins; and maintain strict quality criteria for any lending. It added that it would continue to provide financing for metallurgical coal production, but would do so while seeking to ""support technological developments and industry initiatives that reduce the dependence of the steel industry on coal"". It also stressed that while it would continue to invest in carbon intensive sectors, it would aim to do so in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.

The planned capital raising, via a discounted share sale, is the biggest by an Australian company since the virus outbreak, which has killed 83 people in the country and shut down large parts of the world's 12th-biggest economy. The bank, Australia's third-biggest, said it had decided to pay more than A$850 million in dividends, or about a third of what it paid last year, rather than scrapping it as it did not want investors who depended on the income to dump the stock. Its decision follows a regulatory directive to consider postponing shareholder payouts until the impact of the pandemic was better known. NAB, which brought forward its results by 10 days, is the first Australian bank to report earnings since the pandemic arrived in the country and so portends what could come from the rest of the sector.","WBC,WBK",en,The Sun Daily

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said it lowered the one-year interest rate on the TMLF by 20 basis points to 2.95% from 3.15% in the previous operation. In the same statement, the central bank said it injected 56.1 billion yuan ($7.93 billion) into the economy on Friday, when a batch of 267.4 billion yuan of TMLF loans was due to expire. TMLF loans are aimed at struggling areas of the economy. The gap between the one-year MLF and TMLF was effectively wiped out following Friday's rate move. The gap was kept at 10 basis points in the previous operation in January. The one-year MLF rate now also stands at 2.95%. ""The role of TMLF as a low-cost alternative to MLF is diminishing, as there are various measures providing cheaper funding already,"" said Frances Cheung, head of Asia macro strategy at Westpac in Singapore. ""While the rates are the same, the recipients can be different, hence these are still two facilities,"" she said.","WBC,WBK",en,The Sun Daily

2020-03-06 10:29:00-05:00,Xinja has paused new savings account opening after high-yield 'Stash' deposits skyrocket,"This story was delivered to Business Insider Intelligence Banking subscribers earlier this morning. To get this story plus others to your inbox each day, hours before they're published on Business Insider, click here. Australian neobank Xinja has decided to stop allowing customers to open new accounts, Business Insider Australia reports . The neobank's high-yield ""Stash"" savings account — which offers an impressive 2.25% rate — has seen blistering deposit growth since its launch in mid-January, amassing more than $350 million in deposits in less than two months. These skyrocketing deposits, combined with the recent decision by the Royal Bank of Australia to cut the official cash rate to a record low of 0.5%, have pressured Xinja to contain costs associated with Stash accounts, and the neobank has opted to pause new account opening in order to maintain its current interest rate. Holding its high interest rate steady could work wonders for Xinja's customer loyalty. The neobank's existing Stash customers were likely drawn to Xinja primarily because of its interest rates, which are far higher than those of incumbent banks and on par with other neobanks'.","WBK,WBC",en,Business Insider

At its first meeting of the year, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) held the official cash rate (OCR) at 1.0%, taking comfort from a stabilising economy after its 75 basis points of easing last year. While the central bank flagged coronavirus risks, more upbeat comments about employment and consumer prices bolstered expectations it may not need to cut rates this year, which helped the New Zealand dollar climb 0.5% to $0.6440. All economists polled by Reuters had tipped a hold in policy given domestic risks had receded but said the big unknown would be the hit from the coronavirus epidemic. RBNZ said the overall economic effects of the outbreak in New Zealand would be of a short duration, with most of the impact likely in the first half of 2020. ""Nevertheless, some sectors are being significantly affected,"" RBNZ's monetary policy committee said in a statement accompanying the rates decision.

The neobanks' competitive interest rates are making their accounts more compelling.

2019-11-27 21:36:49-05:00,Australian Q3 business investment flatlines as recovery proves elusive,"SYDNEY: Australian business investment flatlined last quarter as gains in mining and manufacturing were offset by weakness elsewhere, frustrating hopes for a long-awaited and much-needed pick up in spending. During the September quarter, investment dipped 0.2% to A$29.4 billion ($19.95 billion), figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed on Thursday. That was near market forecasts and followed a 0.6% fall in the June quarter. Worryingly, spending on equipment and machinery slid 3.5% and likely dragged on economic growth in the September quarter. The reluctance of businesses to invest is a global problem, blamed in part on the uncertainty generated by the endless Sino-U.S. trade dispute. Australian firms seemed no more confident, with plans for spending in 2019/20 edging up only modestly to A$116.7 billion when analysts had hoped for something around A$120 billion. ""A subdued domestic environment and uncertainty in the global economy may be weighing,"" said Sarah Hunter, chief Australia economist at BIS Oxford Economics. ""Given the challenging economic conditions, firms may well be choosing to sit on their hands, rather than take on a risky capital investment project."" Figures due next week are likely to show Australia's A$1.9 trillion annual gross domestic product (GDP) expanded around 0.5% in the quarter, much as in the previous two quarters, though analysts had yet to finalise their forecasts.","WBK,WBC",en,The Sun Daily

Confidence averaged +9 over the first half of 2018.” “The conditions index rose by 3pts to +7, which still leaves the sharp downtrend in place. By comparison, conditions averaged +18 over the first half of 2018.” “The slowing of the Australian economy during the second half of 2018, which has extended into 2019, is centred on housing and the consumer, with spill-over effects to other sectors.” “A key question, how will this loss of confidence impact business spending decisions? On this, the March NAB business survey is mixed.”","WBK,WBC",en,FXStreet
2019-03-31 23:21:18-05:00,Australia: Correction in dwelling prices continues - Westpac,"Matthew Hassan, analyst at Westpac, notes that the Australia's housing market correction continued in March with prices nationally recording an 18th consecutive monthly decline. Key Quotes “While there are some tentative signs that the pace of falls may be moderating, the start of the year has also seen prices soften in some markets that had been more stable through the correction to date.” “The CoreLogic home value index, covering the eight major capital cities, declined 0.7% in March following a 0.9% decline in Feb and average monthly falls of 1.2% over Nov-Jan. Much of the more moderate pace of decline likely reflects seasonality coming out of the summer holiday period which tends to see weaker prices. Prices nationally are down 8.2%yr and are now 9.2% below their Sep 2017 peak.”","WBK,WBC",en,FXStreet

2019-03-29 04:47:39-05:00,Australia: All eyes on federal budget next week - Westpac,"Sean Callow, analyst at Westpac, notes that Australia’s federal budget is typically delivered in May but with an election required no later than 18 May, the government has opted to announce the budget on Tuesday. Key Quotes “Given that even a short election campaign would be around a month, parliament will be dissolved in April, allowing very little time for any legislation announced on Tuesday to become law.” “But the RBA will be among those watching to see how much stimulus is announced by the government and also the response of the opposition Labor Party, which remains well ahead in opinion polls. The budget will probably draw more interest than the RBA decision a few hours earlier, with a steady hand at 1.5% very likely, along with limited change to the statement.” “The week ahead includes plenty of Australian data, with February updates on retail sales, building approvals and the trade balance all due. Along with the federal budget, these will be important for the Aussie dollar’s ability to keep avoiding a break of 0.","WBK,WBC",en,FXStreet

Key Quotes “Today’s result was stronger than we had expected – we were forecasting a 10% drop after last month’s 13% rise. However, the construction sector is showing some solid momentum, particularly in Auckland.” “Auckland consented more than 14,000 new homes over the past year – the highest level in decades.” “Strength in consent numbers is not limited to Auckland. Low interest rates, strong house price gains and firmness in export incomes supporting home building in many areas.” “Today’s data, along with firmness in recent months, reinforces our expectations that building activity will take another leg higher over 2019. In fact, the extend of that pick up could be even larger than we had been factoring in.","WBK,WBC",en,FXStreet
2019-03-28 23:32:52-05:00,Australia: Softness in private credit continues - Westpac,"Andrew Hanlan, analyst at Westpac, notes that after the Australia’s private credit grew 0.26% in February, while the annual growth edged lower to 4.2%. Key Quotes “Notably, the three month annualised pace for total credit has slipped below 3%, to 2.9%, the weakest result since the post GFC period, 2009 to 2011 - when business credit was contracting.” “Credit growth has progressively slowed since increasing by 6.6% in 2015, followed by a +5.6% in 2016, +4.8% in 2017 and +4.4% in 2018.” “Key to this trend has been the housing sector. Housing credit growth has slowed over recent years: from 7.4% in 2015; 6.3% in both 2016 and 2017; to 4.7% in 2018. The latest annual reading is 4.2%.”","WBK,WBC",en,FXStreet

2019-03-27 23:40:14-05:00,NZ: Business confidence fell back again in March – Westpac,"Michael Gordon, analyst at Westpac, notes that the New Zealand’s business confidence fell again in March, reversing most of the improvement that was seen towards the end of last year. Key Quotes “Sentiment about the general economy fell to a net -38%, while firms’ views of their own activity fell to +6%.” “Confidence was markedly weaker in the construction sector, though more so in the general outlook than in their own activity.” “The pricing gauges in the survey were mixed. Inflation expectations were little changed in March, and have eased back in recent months as fuel prices fell. Pricing intentions rose slightly but remained within their recent ranges.” “The ANZ business confidence survey has greatly overstated the extent of the slowdown in growth over the last year or so. Nevertheless, there is a risk of this pessimism becoming self-fulfilling, which would weigh on business investment and domestic demand. That risk was certainly on the RBNZ’s radar in yesterday’s OCR review statement; the key question will be whether it shows up in the hard activity data.","WBK,WBC",en,FXStreet

Key Quotes “In previous years the Reserve Bank has generally observed that fiscal policy has had only a very limited bearing on monetary policy decisions.” “It is reasonable to contemplate whether 2019 will be different.” “Firstly, if we take the expected approach from the Budget (an expansionary budget with a focus on supporting households) then the Reserve Bank will be much more interested than in previous years.” “We have estimated that the government will have around $3bn to allocate before June 30; and $5bn in 2019/20. In addition there will be the $2.5bn in 2019/20 which was earmarked in MYEFO as “allocated but not announced”.”","WBK,WBC",en,FXStreet

Key Quotes “The RBNZ is now saying that ""the more likely direction of the next OCR move is down."" It also said that the balance of risks to the economic outlook "" has shifted to the downside."" This is very different to February, when the RBNZ said the next move could be ""up or down"" and that there were ""both upside and downside risks."" “With only a few paragraphs to go on, it is difficult to discern exactly how serious the RBNZ is about cutting the OCR. The additional spanner in the works is that a committee will take over the decision making from 1 April, and the committee could chose a different stance. But clearly, the odds of an OCR reduction this year have increased.” “We were very surprised by this change of stance, because the economic situation has not changed much since the RBNZ's last missive in February.","WBK,WBC",en,FXStreet

Key Quotes “We anticipate that all of the upside surprise to the Budget will be returned to the people – in the form of lower taxes and higher spending. This is a budget that will 'give back to the people'.” “Key points on the budget: a return to an underlying cash surplus in 2019/20, to the tune of $4bn, for the first time since 2007/08; and net debt as a share of the economy peaked in 2017/18, at 18.5% of GDP.” “The budget profile in MYEFO and expected to be confirmed in the Budget, is: –$5.2bn in 2018/19; +$4.1bn in 2019/20; widening to +$19bn in 2021/22.” “On spending flexibility, recall that MYEFO factored in 'decisions taken but not yet announced' to the tune of $2.5bn for 2019/20, $3.8bn in 2020/21 and $3.0bn in $2021/22.”","WBK,WBC",en,FXStreet

The greenback was advancing from the midpoint of the 96 handle and when on to make a high of 96.85 surrounded by an hourly bullish Ichimoku cloud formation and forming an ascending channel with a target on the 97 handle, albeit with momentum spent according to stochastics.

2019-03-26 00:15:09-05:00,US: Recession talk is on the rise – Westpac,"According to Richard Franulovich, head of FX strategy at Westpac, the inversion of the 3m-10yr US yield curve late last week has understandably put US recession risk back in the spotlight given its enviable track record as a predictor of US recessions. Key Quotes “The yield curve based model accurately predicted all five US recessions that occurred in-sample between 1970-1996 (i.e. the estimated probability of a recession exceeded 50%) and accurately predicted the two recessions that occurred out of sample in 2001 and 2008-2009 too.” “This same model currently estimates the probability of a US recession at a relatively high 20% over the next twelve months. But, if the curve remains inverted for another two months the probability rises to just over 40%; a very elevated reading.”","WBK,WBC",en,FXStreet

Key Quotes “In seasonally adjusted terms, exports rose by 7.7% in February, reversing most of an 8.6% decline in January. There were large gains in dairy, reflecting the strong growth in milk production during spring and early summer, and a rebound in meat exports.” “Imports were up 0.7% in seasonally adjusted terms. Oil import volumes pulled back from an elevated level, while imports of capital equipment and consumer goods remained strong.” “The annual trade deficit widened further to $6.62bn, the largest since July 2006. Export earnings have been growing modestly, and will soon receive a further boost from the sharp rise in dairy prices at recent auctions. However, the growth in exports has been outweighed by a strong rise in imports, reflecting the growth in domestic demand. Higher oil import prices also played a role over 2018, but they have eased back in recent months.","WBK,WBC",en,FXStreet

Key Quotes “On Tuesday (or Wednesday) this week another “meaningful vote” is likely on a largely unchanged deal. Parliamentary support for her deal is already low and the lack of support could mean that the deal is not tabled and Parliament could go straight into seeking alternative plans or purposes for a longer extension.” What have EU-27 offered? If May’s deal is passed, the Brexit date is extended until 22nd May. If May’s deal fails, UK has until 12th April to find an alternative plan or purpose after which another 9 month extension is available to facilitate the new plan or purpose.” “So what now ?

Key Quotes “After raising rates four times in 2018, global markets had expected to see a fairly sharp twist in guidance at the FOMC meeting this week.” “But the FOMC still managed to deliver a dovish surprise. In the Dec 2018 projections, 11 of 17 members projected either 2 or 3 rate hikes over 2019, with a median of 2 hikes. The median is now for no hikes at all in 2019 and just 1 by end-2021. That’s down from 3 in December.” “Global markets were clearly surprised by the outcome, with officials cutting their forecast for US growth, abandoning projections for rate rises this year and a surprisingly abrupt end to the process of offloading their bond holdings by September this year.” “US 10 year Treasury bond yields traded below 2.5% for the first time since January 2018, the S&P 500 hit highs since October 2018 and the US dollar slipped from 20 month highs.","WBK,WBC",en,FXStreet

Key Quotes “Along with the “dots”, the Fed trimmed its 2019 and 2020 GDP forecasts to 2.1% and 1.9% (the White House budget projections are 3.2% and 3.0%) and announced that its balance sheet runoff (quantitative tightening) would conclude in Sep 2019, earlier than many expected.” “The Fed’s switch to projection of a rates pause of at least 12 months should reverberate on the dollar and US yields for some time, weighing on DXY towards its January lows.

Key Quotes “In 2019 to date, the FOMC have been cautious on the economic outlook and the need for any further tightening of policy – a stark contrast to the optimistic view put forward at the December 2018 meeting, and the Committee’s expectation then of 3 further hikes.” “At their March 2019 meeting, the Committee formally confirmed this shift in stance, with downward revisions to their forecasts for the US’ real economy and their federal funds rate profile. Chair Powell also announced that balance sheet reduction would slow from May and end in September 2019.” “The Committee’s projected policy path sees no hikes in 2019 (the view of 11 of 17 Committee members), and only one more hike to a mid-point of 2.625% in 2020.” “While the Committee’s longer-run view on the federal funds rate is a touch higher at 2.","WBK,WBC",en,FXStreet

The consensus amongst most economists and analysts suggest, that the Fed will likely leave its current policy rate unchanged, while the central bank is likely to move the median policy rate forecast for 2019 to just one hike from two previously . In addition, they are expecting that Fed will likely announce an end to its quantitative tightening. ABN AMRO “We expect the FOMC to keep interest rates on hold this Wednesday, and to announce an end to the balance sheet runoff in September, though there is a risk the announcement could slip to a subsequent meeting.” “We expect Chair Powell to strike a somewhat dovish tone in his press conference, noting the continued global economic uncertainty given the lack of a stabilisation in the global industrial sector. However, we also expect him to acknowledge the substantial improvement in domestic financial conditions since late last year, and signs of resilience in domestic demand, such as the rebound in consumer confidence.” “At the same time, while we expect a shift lower in the dots rate hike projections to show just one rate hike in 2019, this might disappoint financial markets, which now price in around 6bp of rate cuts by year end.","WBK,WBC",en,FXStreet

Key Quotes “The Index has now registered three consecutive months in which the growth rate has been negative. This is a strengthening signal that growth through the first two to three quarters of 2019 is likely to be below trend.” “The signal from the Index is certainly consistent with the weak momentum in the second half of 2018 revealed in the print of the December quarter national accounts. In the second half of 2018 growth momentum slowed to an annualised pace of 1% from a 4% pace in the first half of the year.” “Westpac expects growth in the Australian economy in 2019 to be around 2.2% – significantly below trend which is generally assessed as 2.75%.” “The Index growth rate has shown a significant deterioration over the last six months, declining from +0.47% in September to –0.56% in February.","WBK,WBC",en,FXStreet

Key Quotes “The balance of goods trade moved further into deficit, offset by higher tourism earnings and solid investment income inflows.” “The deficit has widened over the last year due to a decline in the terms of trade and, until recently, high import volumes.” “With trade prices turning more favourable in recent months, we expect the current account deficit to narrow again over 2019.”","WBK,WBC",en,FXStreet

Key Quotes “The next Official Cash Rate review on 27 March will have to acknowledge that the balance of developments since February has been to the downside. If our GDP forecast proves correct, the market response is very likely to be negative (i.e. NZD and swap yields lower).” “Our observation of the full set of NZ GDP data surprises since the 2009 GFC is that every disappointment resulted in a lower NZD/USD one hour after announcement.” “The average magnitude of response is 1.7% for a 1% data surprise. Thus, in this case, if the surprise is -0.3ppts (Westpac 0.3% - median 0.6%), the response should be a 0.5% fall in NZD/USD, or a 5bp fall in NZ 2yr swap rates.

Key Quotes “The reading for the Composite index is supported by rising output, overtime and backlog, but partly offset by new orders increasing at a slower pace and a flattening of employment. The Australian economy slowed significantly in the second half of 2018 to finish with below-trend growth of 2.3% through the year. That reflects weaker private demand, with public spending remaining a bright spot.” “A number of components of the Survey are suggestive of an emerging slowdown. Assessments of the general business situation, new orders expectations and equipment investment intentions are all at or around lows back to 2015.” “Manufacturing is benefitting from the public infrastructure boom and a relatively low Australian dollar is boosting international competitiveness.",WBK,en,FXStreet

Key Quotes “In the final paragraph of the section on the policy outlook, the Board noted “they assessed that it would be appropriate to hold the cash rate steady while new information became available that could help resolve the current tensions in the domestic economic data”.” “In the minutes, the Board speculated that “GDP growth over 2018 had been a little lower than anticipated at the time of the February Statement on Monetary Policy”. In fact, annual GDP growth in 2018 printed 2.3% compared to the RBA’s estimate in February of 2.75% - hardly consistent with the description “a little lower”. The minutes also noted that the accounts were likely to confirm a “markedly slower pace of growth in the second half of 2018 than in the first half”. In fact, the accounts printed a 4% annualised pace in the first half, down to a 1% annualised pace in the second half.” “The tension that the minutes refer to is around conditions in the labour market, which “had continued to improve”, while “leading indicators continued to suggest that employment growth was likely to remain above average, although some indicators have turned down a little recently”.” “ The Board has raised the importance of data releases over the next few months and has left open the possibility to cut rates should those releases disappoint.",WBK,en,FXStreet
2019-03-18 23:49:29-05:00,NZ: Consumer confidence down 5.3 points to 103.8 in March – Westpac,"Satish Ranchhod, senior economist at Westpac, notes that the New Zealand’s Westpac-McDermott Miller Consumer Confidence Index fell 5.3 points in March to a level of 103.8, suggesting that the consumer confidence has lost altitude and now sits at a below average level. Key Quotes “Confidence was down across all income brackets, age groups and regions.” “Households have highlighted increased concern about their personal financial situation. They are also concerned about the trajectory of the economy over the next few years.” “Despite the increased concern about the economic outlook, spending appetites only softened a little.”",WBK,en,FXStreet
2019-03-18 07:41:58-05:00,FOMC likely to again emphasis a need for patience - Westpac,"According to analysts at Westpac, the market focus this week will be on Wednesday’s FOMC meeting, which is again likely to emphasis a need for patience. Key Quotes “Of key interest will be the quarterly Summary of Economic Projections, including revisions to key forecasts, as well as any discussion around balance sheet normalisation.” “The consensus is that the Fed Funds “dots” will be lower, but the key question is how far will they fall? The existing median for two hikes this year should likely fall to one, consistent with Westpac’s view. Two of seventeen dots expect no hikes this year, but with the Fed in data dependent mode and key communications underscoring the need for patience, it would be no surprise if this number was to jump significantly from two.” “In addition, we will be very interested in the long run projection. It is likely to fall to 2.5%, which will provide some scope for a further fall in 10yr yields, although considering our expectation that yields should peak at or around the Fed Funds peak, an extended rally under that scenario should be short-lived.","WBK,WBC",en,FXStreet

2019-03-18 00:00:45-05:00,Australia: Employment likely to fall by –5k in February - Westpac,"Justin Smirk, analyst at Westpac, suggests that their –5k forecast for February is more about monthly volatility than the start of a new trend for the Australian economy, after the total employment lifted a solid 39.1k in January, well clear of the market median of 15k. Key Quotes “The year started with a solid trend pace of employment growth with a three month average gain of 31.9k. While it is just one month into the year, employment has gained 271k in the year to January (2.2%yr) with a very solid 2.9%yr six month annualised pace.” “There is, however, an important caveat – January is the peak holiday month in Australia as Christmas, New Year and school summer vacation all come together. Little business happens in Australia at this time.” “We believe that employment growth is set to stall through the first half of 2019, in part due to uncertainty surrounding the April Federal election but also some payback for the earlier strength in the labour market. However, our –5k forecast for February is more about monthly volatility than the start of a new trend.","WBK,WBC",en,FXStreet

Key Quotes “The ECB has additionally extended the potential of an end to its Negative Interest Rate Policy (NIRP) into next year.” “Markets are likely to focus on interest rate differentials favouring US and so maintain a EUR downside bias. However, the purpose of ECB’s policy accommodation is to bolster vulnerable sentiment and expectations. ZEW’s Eurozone expectations and EC’s regional consumer confidence have shown tentative signs of basing and an upturn could at least limit the downside should EUR/USD break below 1.1250.” “In the interim, UK‘s inability to agree a Withdrawal Agreement is likely to cloud sentiment into the EU Leaders’ Summit (21st-22nd) and also raise political concerns around the forthcoming elections for the EU Parliament (18th-23rd May).","WBK,WBC",en,FXStreet

2019-03-15 00:43:38-05:00,UK: A week full of drama – Westpac,"According to analysts at Westpac, the past week has been high on drama for the UK economy, with three Brexit votes in Parliament. Key Quotes “First, Prime Minister May’s deal was voted down for a second time. Then a ‘no deal’ Brexit was precluded by the second vote. And finally via the third vote, scope for an extension of the Article 50 negotiation period was approved.” “While the second and third votes are positive steps, they do not narrow the divide between the various political factions. Indeed, the potential length of the extension is particularly divisive. If PM May’s agreement is successful, Parliament have agreed on an extension to 30 June.” “But, if unsuccessful, uncertainty is set to remain rife as the extension date for this scenario was not made absolute by the third vote. It is likely that the EU will push for as lengthy a negotiation period as possible. In our view, this is the best that can be hoped for, in order to allow perspective and time for fruitful discussions.”","WBK,WBC",en,FXStreet

Key Quotes “On top of that the previous month was revised up from 5,080 to 6,800. Those are some of the strongest figures we’ve seen in at least 18 years. However, these figures need to be taken with a large grain of salt.” “Today’s data and the related revisions leave the annual inflow of people into the country running at 58,000. That implies a significant and sudden change in direction in net migration over the past two months.”","WBK,WBC",en,FXStreet

2019-03-14 03:53:19-05:00,Fed: Dots should see a dovish shift - Westpac,"Richard Franulovich, head of FX strategy at Westpac, suggests that the Fed’s dots should see a dovish shift, the existing median for two hikes this year likely falling to one, but the big story could be the dovish tail. Key Quotes “Two of seventeen dots expected no hikes this year in Dec 2018 (likely Bullard and Kashkari) but with the Fed in a data dependent mode and influential commentators like Brainard highlighting the expiry of Bipartisan Budget Act in early 2020 (+0.3% of GDP 2018/19) the threshold for hikes later this year is very high.” “It wouldn’t be a surprise if the number of dots for no hikes this year jumps significantly from two. Powell, Clarida and Williams all reiterated last week that Fed Funds is “at” or “within the range” of neutral, but with Fed Funds at 2.375% and neutral ranging from 2.5-3.5% it must be the case that the neutral dot has fallen, likely to a new median of 2.50%.” “USD sticking to its broad 95-97.7 range for yet another week, a dovish Fed next week likely to see the lower end of that range tested.","WBK,WBC",en,FXStreet

2019-03-14 01:11:17-05:00,Fed dots for steady rates? - Westpac,"comments underscore that the Fed’s dots will likely see a meaningful dovish shift. Key Quotes “Chair Powell’s assessment of where Fed Funds sits in relation to neutral remains “fluid” but the trend remains dovish. Last week Powell said, “federal funds rate is now within the broad range of estimates of the neutral rate”. That appears to be yet another shift on his part, albeit subtle, when compared with to his comments in Dec 2018 when he said, “Where we are right now is the lower end of neutral”.” “Clarida echoed Powell’s “within the range” comments, noting; “ federal funds rate (is) now in the range of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants' estimates of its longer-run neutral level.” NY Fed President Williams, longtime key “point man” on the neutral debate agreed, noting that the Fed is “… right at neutral”, based on his estimate that real r-star is 0.5% + 2% inflation.” “Separately, Brainard cited a key potential headwind for early 2020 last week, “The Bipartisan Budget Act, which is estimated to boost GDP growth by 0.3 percentage point, on average, per year in 2018 and 2019, is scheduled to expire in 2020.","WBK,WBC",en,FXStreet

2019-03-13 19:17:36-05:00,When is China’s retail sales and industrial production release and how could it affect the AUD/USD?,"Early Thursday sees the annualized figures of January month retail sales and industrial production from the National Bureau of Statistics of China at 02:00 GMT. Investors would emphasize more on the monthly release as a week-long Lunar New Year holiday in February makes present updates the year’s first data dump from the dragon nation. Retail sales growth is expected to have softened to 8.1% year-on-year against 8.2% reported prior whereas industrial production is seen following macro weakness with 5.5% YoY figure versus 5.7% previous. Ahead of the release, analysts at Westpac say, “China activity data is the main focus in Sydney trade, with Jan-Feb readings on industrial production, retail sales and fixed asset investment due at 1pm Syd/10am local. We are most interested in IP. The last reading was 5.7%yr in Dec, a modest improvement from 5.4% in Nov which was the slowest pace of growth since the depths of the GFC. Note that this is still a decent rate of expansion, in contrast to the PMI surveys which have been touted as implying outright contraction.","WBK,WBC",en,FXStreet
2019-03-13 06:29:00-05:00,Stocks Tread Water Ahead Of No-Deal Brexit Vote; Boeing Slide Continues,"Global markets slipped on Wednesday after two days of gains amid mounting concern over world growth and trade, as S&P500 futures were coiled around the critical 2,800 ""quad top"" support level again, European stocks edged higher, and Asian shares declined amid mounting concern over world growth and trade and ahead of a key ""no deal"" Brexit vote, where optimism that lawmakers were set to eventually delay Brexit sent the pound higher. Europe's Stoxx 600 index jumped into positive territory, gaining as much as 0.2%, led by oil stocks after a mixed open, as gains for car makers and miners offset a slide for retailers following disappointing earnings from Inditex, owner of the Zara chain, and Adidas. Attempts to boost European optimism were unable to shake off the somber mood in Asian trading, where last week’s optimism over U.S.-China trade talks has faded after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said it was unclear whether gaps between the two sides could be closed. Meanwhile, Asian data continue to reinforce the picture of a slowing world economy.","WBK,WBC",en,Zero Hedge
