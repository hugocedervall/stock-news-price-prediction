According to Allison Ullo of the public relations firm With Sara, which caters to health and beauty product companies, many of the brands she represents have had multiple issues as they frantically search for bottles so they can continue to fill orders. “Self-care products, as well as natural hair products, in particular, have seen a spike in sales as people look to care for their bodies and minds during this difficult time,” said Ullo. She contacted PlasticsToday to see if running a story about this shortage might prompt some producers of plastic bottles and jars for the health and beauty market to step up production. A recent article in Breitbart News , “Coronavirus: US Reliance on China Spurs Plastic Bottle Shortage,” supports Ullo’s claim, noting that about 34% of the plastic bottles imported to the United States are made in China and 28% in Canada.",BERY,en,PlasticsToday
