2020-09-08 02:00:00-05:00,Winners and Losers of BlackRock’s Climate Pushback (So Far),"In January, the world's largest asset manager issued a warning shot that the status quo on climate change is not going to cut it. In his annual letter, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink wrote: “We don’t yet know which predictions about the climate will be most accurate, nor what effects we have failed to consider. But there is no denying the direction we are heading. Every government, company, and shareholder must confront climate change.” With more than $6 trillion of investments under management and influence in boardrooms of nearly 1,800 companies, what BlackRock says carries big weight across the corporate and political world. But that weight only hits home if BlackRock follows through and presses for a response to climate change in boardrooms. Among its specific pledges, BlackRock said it will divest from companies deriving 25 percent or more of their revenue from thermal coal, and press companies to make climate and sustainability disclosures aligned with Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).",CTRA,en,Green Technology Media

2020-08-04 13:00:44-05:00,How Contura Energy built a letter of credit application on Amazon Managed Blockchain | Amazon Web Services,"This is a guest post from Sammy Jordan, Assistant Treasurer at Contura Energy, in partnership with Emile Baizel, Sr. Blockchain Architect at AWS. In their own words, “Contura Energy is a Tennessee-based coal supplier with affiliate mining operations across major coal basins in Virginia, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. We export metallurgical coal, a key raw material in steelmaking, to customers on five continents and approximately 25 countries.” Contura chose to run the blockchain network on Amazon Managed Blockchain because it's a fully managed service that scales automatically, as needed, and removes a lot of the heavy lifting needed to operate a blockchain network. Additionally, you can easily integrate Managed Blockchain with other AWS services, and Managed Blockchain simplifies growing and administering the blockchain network.
