In terms of expectations the US numbers are expected to tick up from the high 40s to the 51-52 range. In Europe there is more of a spread but the composite is expected to be at 51. It will be interesting to see if the European numbers can edge ahead of the US given the clearer run of reopenings.

""I'm very confident that as we do add back resources, we will not add them back on a one-to-one basis,"" said Canadian National Railway (NYSE: CNI ) Chief Financial Officer Ghislain Houle at the Deutsche Bank 11th Annual Virtual Global Industrials & Materials Summit on June 9. Houle was explaining how CN would call back furloughed employees as the North American economy rebounds and demand for rail capacity grows. Given the uncertainties of how the economy and certain sectors, such as the automotive sector, might recover, CN would be ""patient"" in bringing people back from furlough, Houle said.

Hamann also spoke at an investor conference sponsored by investment firm UBS on June 2. Although international intermodal volumes have fallen by about 16% quarter-to-date amid canceled vessel sailings to U.S. West Coast ports, the railroad is ""feeling just a tad more optimistic"" amid expectations that volumes might have bottomed out in April and May, Hamann said on June 2. However, ""it's hard to call the bottom"" because it's hard to gauge how U.S. consumers will respond to the easing of shelter-in-place mandates, and so ""a lot of question marks out there still need to be answered,"" she said at UBS.",UNP,en,Benzinga Feeds

But factories still have to ramp up manufacturing, and it's unclear when production will return to normal. How a production lull in China will affect North American railroads remains to be seen, executives said. ""I would not be surprised if we see another two, three, four weeks of ramp up before we … get to the point where we were four months ago,"" said Keith Reardon, senior vice president of the consumer product supply chain for Canadian National (NYSE: CNI ). Not only do Chinese manufacturers need to ramp up production, they also need to get the country's supply chain from the plants to the ports back in order, Reardon said Thursday at a Barclays investor conference.",UNP,en,Benzinga Feeds

On Monday, Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP ) told customers of its premium segment that it would open a number of domestic interline lanes originating on Union Pacific (UP) and destined for various points in the Eastern U.S. These lanes, which interchange with Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC ) and CSX (NASDAQ: CSX ) will be activated on Saturday. UP's premium segment includes its intermodal service. Shipping finished vehicles and automotive parts is also part of UP's premium segment. Meanwhile, Norfolk Southern (NS) said the opportunities to take market share away from trucks are not only in intermodal but also in merchandise. NS's merchandise segment includes commodities such as agricultural products, automotive parts, chemicals, construction materials and metals.

Operating ratio (OR), a measure of a company's financial health, can be calculated by dividing operating expenses by revenue. Union Pacific's (UP) full-year OR for 2019 was 60.6%, compared with 62.7% for 2018. The company is eyeing an OR of ""sub-60"" for 2020. The operating efficiencies that UP has laid out for the year follow expectations for rail volumes to grow by about 1% in 2020 amid gains for its agricultural and intermodal segments and despite anticipated declines for coal and frac sand. ""I don't think we put a fine point on exactly what volume is going to look like next year,"" said UP CEO Lance Fritz during his company's fourth-quarter 2019 earnings call on Thursday. ""But let's walk you through what needs to happen to have volume growth occur. In intermodal, we need international intermodal to get back to normal, where U.S. consumers feel healthy and they are consuming and it's coming in off West Coast ports.""

2019-12-31 11:54:22-05:00,2019 Rocks The Railroads,"A slump in North American rail volumes, record Canadian grain rail shipments and an active Surface Transportation Board were just some of the prominent themes in 2019. Here's a list — far from exhaustive — of some of the key issues that faced the rail industry this year. Lower Rail Volumes In North America Perhaps the most visible theme in 2019 was the weekly year-over-year decline in rail volumes, which resulted in the readjusting of earnings guidance by some of the Class I railroads. In the first half of the year, severe floods stymied Midwest freight rail operations, with Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP ), BNSF (NYSE: BRK ), Kansas City Southern (NYSE: KSU ) and even Eastern U.S. railroad Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC ) needing to reroute service and/or repair damaged sections of track in states such as Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri. But as the year progressed, rail volumes continued to trend lower as a result of a variety of factors, which deserve their own heading: Trade uncertainty : Strained trade relations between the U.S. and China, in which each country slapped tariffs on the other country's goods (soybeans, consumer goods, etc.), contributed to weakening the U.S. industrial economy because investors were hesitant to proceed with projects until they had more clarity on the direction of the U.S. economy.",UNP,en,Benzinga Feeds
