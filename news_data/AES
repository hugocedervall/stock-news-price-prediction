The deal hands an exit to AMS investors, including former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who bought into the startup's early vision of turning commercial buildings into flexible grid assets. After winning pivotal utility contracts in California, AMS ran up against the capital constraints of managing a multi-year infrastructure buildout as a venture-backed company. In 2017, it pivoted to software to dispatch grid assets more profitably in competitive markets. That's the expertise Fluence bought. The joint venture between AES and Siemens already provides software to its battery customers to govern system safety and performance, and to dispatch according to market rules and interconnection constraints. But the AI-backed real-time trading algorithm AMS built will help Fluence customers make more money on their projects, said Fluence CTO Brett Galura. ""Energy storage is really the first truly dispatchable digital asset on the electric grid,"" Galura said in an interview Wednesday. ""We knew that the best way to continue to add value would be to continue to add more digital capabilities.""

The transition to a low carbon economy depends on the decarbonisation of the electricity utilities sector, which is expected to grow rapidly over the next few decades as power demand soars to support new clean technologies such as electric vehicles and heat pumps. Yet a report published today by the global benchmarking body highlights how the sector's largest and most influential companies are still failing to set rigorous, Paris Agreement-aligned goals. While 42 companies assessed in WBA's report have low carbon transition plans in place, only half contain appropriate financial content and just four companies have aligned their strategies with the Paris Agreement's climate goals, according to the group.",AES,en,BusinessGreen

The first installations will happen by the end of the year, COO John Zahurancik said in an interview. This marks the first new edition since Fluence formed as a joint venture between AES and Siemens in 2018; AES Energy Storage had developed the Advancion product previously. It follows similar product updates from other leading storage integrators, like Tesla’s Megapack and Powin Energy’s BESS. NEC Energy Solutions went a different route; its parent company decided last week to wind down operations rather than invest in technological advancement.

But there’s a big difference between discounts and straight-up free thermostat giveaways. At least that’s what Michigan utility Consumers Energy is hoping. On Tuesday, Consumers announced it has started giving away up to 100,000 Google Nest E thermostats to customers, in a bid to boost energy efficiency as part of its 50 percent clean energy by 2030 goals. In exchange, customers must agree to let energy services provider Uplight remotely control their thermostats to reduce air conditioner loads up to four hours per day during no more than 14 of the hottest days per year. Consumers Energy is relying on this load reduction to yield as much as 14 megawatts of peak capacity to bid into the markets of midwestern grid operator MISO.

The SPDR Utilities Select Sector ETF shed 1.0% in afternoon trade, with 27 of 28 equity components losing ground. The biggest decliner was NRG Energy Inc.'s stock which slumped 5.1%. Among other more active utilities ETF components, shares of AES Corp. lost 2.3%, Excelon Corp. gave up 0.9% and Southern Co. shed 0.6%. The lone gainer was Sempra Energy's stock which tacked on 0.6%. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose 3.6 basis points to 2.484%, after falling 10.4 basis points the previous three sessions, as a bounce in the stock market helped calm risk-off trades. Utilities stocks tend to have relatively high dividend yields, so a rise in yields on low-risk Treasurys make them less attractive.
