2019-11-27 04:24:58-05:00,Capital Markets Weekly: China successfully returns to dollar market in Thanksgiving-affected week,"Emerging market issuance China mandated 13 banks on 25 November for USD-denominated issuance, opening books on 26 November and offering three, five, 10 and 20-year tranches. Initial price guidance was reported at 60, 65, 70 and 75 basis points over US Treasuries respectively for the four tranches. Final pricing was set at margins of 35, 40, 50 and 70 basis points, with books exceeding USD20 billion. China sized the deal to raise USD6 billion in total, comprising USD1.5 billion and USD2 billion for the two shorter-dated tranches: it placed USD2 billion for 10-years and USD500 million for the 20-year tranche. Within China's domestic market, China Development Bank has filed to sell CNY6 billion (USD852 million) of debt. This is of note in that half the sale will comprise two-year floating rate notes linked to the one-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR), a central bank policy rate. The issue is the first issue by a Chinese policy bank linked to LPR. The relatively modest size involved suggests that this is a largely-symbolic step designed to increase the market's usage of LPR as a reference rate, rather than a more fundamental reconfiguration of the market.",IIF,en,IHS Markit
