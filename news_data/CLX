CBS News reported last week that “Online, sales of virus protection products have skyrocketed, up 817% in the last two months. Two large bottles of Purell hand sanitizer were on sale for $299 on Amazon. That size normally sells for about $9 a bottle. Another listing, for four boxes of masks, is usually about $20 — it was being sold for more than $1,000.” In response, some state governments have already vowed to punish “price gouging.” “California’s attorney general told businesses that if they violated price gouging laws, ‘You’d better be prepared to pay the price for your lawbreaking.’ New York City is issuing $500 fines to any stores found price gouging, starting this week,” CBS reported. Indeed, even the Department of Justice issued a warning that they “stand(s) ready to make sure that bad actors do not take advantage of emergency response efforts, healthcare providers, or the American people during this crucial time.” The trade group The Consumer Brands Association praised the DOJ’s response, saying “We appreciate the Department of Justice’s swift response to Consumer Brands’ request to combat price gouging and ensure American consumers have access to critical products at affordable prices.” But does preventing ‘price gouging’ during times of distress actually help ensure that critical products will remain available at affordable prices?",CLX,en,Zero Hedge

The woman's family opposed the abortion , but the woman is under the care of a UK National Health Service trust, where doctors argued an abortion would be less traumatic than giving birth. The case was heard in the Court of Protection , which handles cases concerning individuals who are judged to lack the mental capacity to make decisions for themselves. Read more stories like this on INSIDER. A UK judge authorized doctors to perform an abortion on a 22-weeks pregnant London woman in her twenties after deciding it was in the best interest of the woman, whose developmental disabilities and mood disorder are believed to give her the mental capacity of a child between the ages of six and nine. The woman's family opposed the abortion procedure, but the woman's doctors in a UK National Health Service Trust argued that an abortion would be less traumatic than giving birth, and the judge decided that giving a child up for adoption would cause the woman to ""suffer greater trauma."" "" I am acutely conscious of the fact that for the state to order a woman to have a termination where it appears that she doesn't want it is an immense intrusion,"" Justice Nathalie Lieven said in her ruling, according to The Independent . ""I have to operate in [her] best interests, not on society's views of termination.""'

Because it's the day we finally learned - thanks to a repoert in the Wall Street Journal - that Jeff Bezos (and, presumably, his investors) tolerance for loss-making businesses does have its limits. According to emails obtained by the paper, Amazon-owned Whole Foods Market raised prices this month on dozens of items ranging from Dr. Bronner’s soaps to Häagen-Dazs ice cream. These prices hikes followed increases on another 55 items, including crackers, olives and cookies, according to an email from December. The reason for the price hikes? As we have previously reported , Clorox, Coca-Cola and Mondelez are just a few of the producers of consumer products, snack foods and beverages who were preparing to raise prices. According to figures cited by WSJ, nearly half of 52 consumer-goods manufacturers surveyed recently by consulting firm Acosta raised prices last year. The hikes, we argued at the time, would blindside consumers who have grown accustomed to sub-2% inflation in a world where the Phillips Curve has broken down.",CLX,en,Zero Hedge
