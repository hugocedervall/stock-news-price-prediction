Riley analyst Dave Kang upgraded the stock to buy from neutral, arguing that the uncertainty over a U.S. ban on sales to Huawei Technologies Co. has been ""de-risked."" Shares dropped more than 30% last week after the ban was announced. ""One of the reasons for our renewed bullishness is that we believe the Huawei ban could be another leverage point for President Trump, who is set to meet with China's President Xi at the G20 Summit in late June, and as such, we believe the ban could be fairly brief,"" Kang wrote. ""Furthermore, we believe the Huawei ban will pressure NeoPhotonics management to weigh strategic options, including the potential sale of the company."" The upgrade comes as fellow optoelectronics company Lumentum Holdings Inc. lowered its outlook as a result of the Huawei ban and as companies like Alphabet Inc.'s Google began to comply with the order. NeoPhotonics shares are still off 35% on the year, as the S&P 500 has risen 14%.",NPTN,en,MarketWatch

2019-05-17 07:37:46-05:00,"NeoPhotonics' stock set to extend selloff after MKM cuts rating, slashed price target in half","Shares of NeoPhotonics Corp. were indicated down nearly 7% in premarket trade, extending the previous session's 21% plunge, after MKM Partners analyst Michael Genovese cut his rating on the optical equipment maker and slashed his price target in half, following the Trump administration's moves to ban business with China's Huawei Technologies. Genovese downgraded NeoPhotonics to neutral from buy, and lowered his stock fair value estimate to $4.50 from $9.00, given that Huawei is the company's largest customer, representing about 46% of sales in 2018. He said he ""holds out hope"" that there is a 50% probability that the ban is walked back as part of a trade agreement, which would then turn the recent selloff into a great buying opportunity.

""Management did not refute potential inventory builds from Chinese customers but considered these moderate and largely linked to expected regional activity."" Needham analyst Alex Henderson said there was ""some improvement in the outlook,"" though it was clouded by issues with mix and foreign exchange. ""Even as demand out of China is improving, the mix has surprised with a shift to 100G/200G older products for longhaul backbones,"" he wrote. ""This put a bit of unexpected pressure on GMs which came in at 22.5% below our forecast of 26%."" Henderson has a strong buy rating on the shares and a $12 target.
