2020-01-16 09:41:19-05:00,3 Buy-Rated Mortgage REIT Stocks That Pay a 7% Dividend Yield — Or More,"Do you love dividends? Of course you do -- and rightly so! Scholars who study the stock market's historical performance estimate that over time, the payment (and reinvestment, and compounding) of dividends have contributed anywhere from 30% to 90% of the S&P 500's total returns. Simply put, if you're not investing in dividend stocks, you're doing it wrong. And if you do love dividends, there's one sector in particular you should be focusing on: Real estate investment trusts, or REITs, pay out some of the most generous yields available to investors today, in many cases, several times more yield than the 2% average on the S&P 500. Knowing this, and having just been presented with a new stock report from investment bank B. Riley FBR, we've taken a good close look at the REITs highlighted therein -- and run them through our TipRanks Stock Screener tool to ensure that other analysts agree with B. Riley.
