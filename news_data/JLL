Esta tendencia se siguió consolidando hasta entrado el siglo XXI y los edificios de oficinas, además de fungir como un segundo hogar para los trabajadores (por el tiempo que pasaban allí) y diseñados para promover la eficiencia, se convirtieron en símbolo del poder de las empresas. A través de sus construcciones, las compañías reflejaban su influencia, capacidad económica y bienestar.

Entrusted with marketing and branding roles in the company for the past 15 years, she seems to have been groomed to take charge. JLL underwent rebranding and changed its brand logo last year. The change at the helm comes at a time when JLL has been underperforming on the ground as well as on the bourses.The company’s third quarter net sales dropped exceptionally by 6% over the year-ago level to the lowest in the past ten quarters. It is likely to miss its target of 12-14% revenue growth for this fiscal. Stress in the rural market, which accounts for nearly 40% of the company’s business, has impacted the overall performance.
