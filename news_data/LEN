Seinen ursprünglichen Zweck erfüllt es aus verschiedensten Gründen nicht: Mal ist der Farbton nicht der gewünschte, mal gibt es minimale Makel – oder es wurde schlichtweg viel zu viel davon hergestellt. In der nächsten Saison kann selbst Letzteres meist nicht mehr verwendet werden, schließlich lebt die Modewelt von ihrer ständigen Neuerfindung. Ein auffälliges Muster oder ein außergewöhnlicher Farbton sind für eine kommende Kollektion kaum zu gebrauchen.

This follows the market’s historic drop on Thursday. Looking back, the dramatic selloff probably indicated that investors believe the government’s fiscal plans and the Fed’s ramped-up funding actions won’t be enough to offset the economic impact of the virus.

But if we’re talking price action, it might be this: In a bear market, rallies tend to fade, and in bull markets, a downside scare tends to reverse quickly, as bargain hunters swoop in. By that definition, yesterday’s bounce might indicate this bull still has some room to run. The market started the week on the back foot as investors remained worried about the fallout from the killing last week of a top Iranian official in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq. But stocks ended up moving into positive territory during the session. Other signs this morning that tensions have been easing—at least among investors—include that oil was pulling back and equity index futures were pointing to a flat-to-slightly-higher open after gains in Asian and European markets.

2019-03-26 11:59:43-05:00,Homebuilders ETF falls despite appearance of 1st bullish 'golden cross' pattern in more than 2 years,"The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF fell 0.5% in afternoon trade Tuesday, in the wake of disappointing housing data, ironically on the same day that a bullish ""golden cross"" chart pattern is set to appear. Of the ETF's 35 equity components, 25 were trading lower. Earlier, data showed that February housing starts dropped a more-than-expected 9% and home price growth slowed in January, to the slowest pace in 6 1/2 years. Meanwhile, a ""golden cross"" is when the 50-day moving average, a short-term trend guide, crosses above the 200-day moving average (DMA), a longer-term trend tracker. Many chart watcher believe the crosses mark the spot a short-term rally transforms into a longer-term uptrend. The homebuilders ETF's (XHB) 50-DMA currently extended to $37.377 while 200-DMA was at $37.370, according to FactSet. That would mark the first time the XHB's 50-DMA was above the 200-DMA since April 20, 2018, and be the first ""golden cross"" since Jan. 23, 2017.

2019-03-26 08:15:22-05:00,"Home builder stocks mostly lower, after disappointing data and loss warning from Beacon Roofing","The home-building sector was trading mostly lower Tuesday, in the wake of disappointing housing starts data and a warning of a wider-than-expected loss from roofing materials distributor Beacon Roofing Supply Inc. . The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF fell 0.8%, with 31 of 48 components losing ground. Earlier, the Commerce Department reported February housing starts fell almost 9% to an annual pace of 1.16 million, below the average forecast of economists surveyed by MarketWatch of a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.21 million. And Beacon Roofing's stock tumbled 7.2% after the company said late Monday that it expected a fiscal second-quarter adjusted loss of 45 cents to 55 cents, compared with the current FactSet loss-per-share consensus of 39 cents, and the loss consensus of 25 cents a share at the end of February. The company blamed ""extremely harsh weather conditions"" for the miss.

The company is slated to report results after Tuesday's close. ""We particularly like the set up for KBH into tomorrow's print,"" Micenko wrote in a note to clients. ""The focus will be on orders and we think they will come in better than consensus."" The FactSet consensus for deliveries is 2,187 units and for new orders is 2,576. Micenko said he believes Lennar Corp. , which is scheduled to report results before Wednesday's open, can also beat orders expectations given conservative guidance, but is worried about gross margin guidance for the rest of the year. Lennar shares rose 3.0% in afternoon trade. KB Home's stock has rallied 24.8% year to date and Lennar's stock has run up 26.8%, while the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF has hiked up 16.9% and the S&P 500 has gained 9.4%.","LEN,LEN.B",en,MarketWatch
