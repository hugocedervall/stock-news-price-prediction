The White House has reportedly opposed that measure , with President Donald Trump saying on September 23 it ""sounds like a political move."" While White House officials had blocked the FDA from publicly releasing those guidelines , the man leading the US government's efforts to help develop a vaccine said he supports the FDA's decision. ""I do think it is appropriate to set the threshold of safety follow-up,"" Moncef Slaoui, the chief advisor to Operation Warp Speed, told Business Insider in a Tuesday phone interview. ""It's very important."" 'A good thing to do' Slaoui added that the ""vast majority"" of serious side effects from vaccines happen in about the first 40 days after getting the shot.

2020-10-01 07:00:00-05:00,We could know if a coronavirus vaccine works in October. Here are the 7 most important events to watch for this month.,"Summary List Placement The month of October could be a turning point in the fight against the pandemic. Within the month, we could have results from the final stage of clinical trials for leading coronavirus vaccine candidates. While the timeline is aggressive because late-stage vaccine trials started just a few months ago, Pfizer's CEO has repeatedly said he expects results in October. If successful, a safe and effective vaccine would shift the challenge from science to logistics: ramping up production and distributing the shot across the nation and world. It's far from certain that any vaccine will have results so early. The studies depend on enough volunteers falling sick, so a board of independent experts can see if a group getting the experimental shots is getting less sick than people receiving a placebo. The trials may require more time to run, going into November, December, or even later before any results are unveiled. Here are the seven key events to watch out for in October in the vaccine race.",GSK,en,Business Insider

If the results are successful, GSK and Sanofi will request regulatory approval in the first half of next year.

Until very recently, the notion that the world could quickly develop and mass produce a vaccine for some new infectious disease within a matter of months seemed impossible. Of course, these aren't normal times. After unveiling the adenovirus-vector vaccine developed by the Gameleya Institute, Russian President Putin claimed that the vaccine was tested first on a small group of willing participants, including one of his own adult daughters.
