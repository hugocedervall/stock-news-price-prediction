(MSFT),"On Thursday, Microsoft revealed that it has generated $9.5 billion in annual contracted partner revenue in the past two years. In two years, partners' earnings from cloud-based services are expected to more than double, according to an MDC Research survey of nearly 1,000 Microsoft cloud partners. The biggest way partners are helping customers is through data and server migration. Read more BI Prime stories here . Microsoft's partner program — a network of partners who help resell Microsoft's software to large customers— is a major part of its business. In fact, 95% of Microsoft's commercial revenue flows through partners. On Thursday, Microsoft revealed that since the partnership program was introduced two years ago, it has generated $9.5 billion in annual contracted partner revenue.

The end of the free-software perk has been met with a huge backlash, with over 3,300 people signing a petition to Microsoft to reverse the changes. Gavriella Schuster, corporate vice president and One Commercial Partner channel chief at Microsoft, says that while it cost the company practically nothing to provide partners with traditional software, it would be a significant expense for the company to provide cloud services like Office 365 for free. Microsoft will instead focus its resources on programs that support business growth for partners, and says that customers will feel more comfortable with the change after these new programs help them land more customers and revenue.
