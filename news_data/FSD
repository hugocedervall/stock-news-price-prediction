2020-08-21 11:49:00-05:00,The Solar Singularity: 2020 Update (Part 2),"For five years running, author Tam Hunt has provided his take on global clean energy markets in his Solar Singularity series. Read his first installment in this year's update here , covering solar and batteries. *** I was optimistic about EV growth in last year’s update and was growing more optimistic this year because of the breadth and depth of the global EV market. Numerous new EV models became available in 2019 and 2020, and global markets showed strong sales for 2019 and early 2020. But some forecasts show EV sales slumping up to 43 percent in 2020 year-over-year, so 2020 is sure to be a serious blip in the overall growth story. We need to look past the current downturn to see the long-term growth story more clearly. As with solar and wind energy, China has become the global leader in terms of both technology development and adoption of EVs and many other green energy technologies. The Chinese EV car market tripled in just the last two years, and China dominates the now-large global electric bus market.",FSD,en,Green Technology Media

Even as the sell-side drums up Tesla's ability to replicate its success in the U.S. EV market in potentially larger markets such as China and Europe, hard data says otherwise, Johnson said. Tesla's Chinese Hopes Falter Amid Weak April Numbers Tesla's car sales in China fell 34.8% month-over-month in April after a strong 449% jump in March, the analyst said in a note. The numbers were even more disappointing, as most competitors gained materially over Tesla in April, he said. Johnson highlighted reports of showroom expansion by Polestar, the luxury EV brand owned by Chinese automaker Geely, and rival Xpeng's plan of opening about 200 outlets by the end of 2020.

2020-05-19 09:25:00-05:00,April Tesla Registrations Plunge 64% In China,"April Tesla Registrations Plunge 64% In China Tyler Durden Tue, 05/19/2020 - 10:25 We might be starting to realize why Tesla CEO Elon Musk appears to have been under such stress lately. While Musk was throwing a weeks-long temper tantrum to the state of California about re-opening his Fremont factory, Tesla China registrations were plunging for April as a result of the coronavirus lockdown and a potential drop-off in demand. Registrations fell 64% year over year in April, according to LMC Automotive and Reuters . The numbers also fell sequentially, with registrations down to 4,633 from 12,709 in March . Corresponding data from the China Passenger Car Association shows that 3,635 Model 3 sedans were registered. Tesla has said that it is striving for 4,000 cars produced per week in June and ""mass production"" of its Model Y SUV starting in the first quarter of 2021. But that begs the question: what if there's nobody there to buy them? Perhaps Musk is asking himself that same question, as he has pulled out one of his favorite ""bait and switch-du jours"" on Twitter last night, stating the price of the company's full self-driving feature (which is both non-existent and illegal right now) will be going up by $1,000 soon.",FSD,en,Zero Hedge

Last week, a report from Jalopnik revealed that Tesla surreptitiously removed the Enhanced Autopilot (EAP) and Full Self-Driving (FSD) features from a Model S that was sold second-hand, through a third-party dealer. On one hand, it looks like a quick attempt to make more money by selling upgrades multiple times on the same vehicle. On the other, it looks like another classic poorly handled Tesla mess-up.

Which was no surprise to us, we already knew that our Heads of State were no match for Macron”, Bathily said.
