WTI crashed into unprecedented negative territory last month. The world is also witnessing one of its biggest demand shocks, as travel curbs due to the coronavirus outbreak have crimped oil consumption by millions of barrels per day. Chevron on Friday said it would further cut its spending by $2 billion to $14 billion, bringing total cuts to $6 billion or 30% Exxon Mobil last month cut its 2020 exploration expenditure by the same, while ConocoPhillips cut its spending for a second time.
