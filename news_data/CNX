2020-10-07 10:10:00-05:00,Morgan Stanley expects more mega-mergers in the oil industry. Here are the 11 deals the bank says are most likely.,"Summary List Placement Hammered by a collapse in oil prices, the energy industry is entering a new phase focused on returns, which is likely to bring a wave of consolidation, analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note Wednesday. Deals could help US oil companies Exxon and Chevron diversify and build out their clean-energy assets, they said. ""European peers have begun to reposition portfolios away from oil & gas production,"" the analysts said in the note. ""Majors in the US have been slower to adapt despite sharing similar advantages of scale. Focusing on M&A in the power sector, companies with renewable development capabilities could be particularly attractive alternatives to oil & gas."" Today, the energy industry remains fragmented, the analysts said, resulting in a recent spike in deals. Most notably, Chevron acquired Noble Energy in early October through a $5 billion all-stock deal, while shale giants Devon Energy and WPX Energy announced plans to merge in late September. Read more: Layoffs, bankruptcies, and dividend cuts: We're tracking how 20 energy giants from Shell to Exxon are responding to the collapse in oil prices ""M&A has picked up again and, largely for the first time in recent memory, been rewarded by the market,"" Morgan Stanley said. ""We expect that to continue."" The bank says future deals are most likely between companies focused on oil production, and among the largest integrated oil majors and smaller energy producers.","CNX,COP",en,Business Insider

The leaders of the two major parties are both unloved by large swathes of their own party’s traditional base. Brexit has created divides within both tribes as well. And the question of a second Scottish independence referendum offers a high-stakes backdrop. A marked shift in this election is the emergence of the environment as a major issue of concern for voters. Pollsters YouGov asked people to list their three top issues in the run to the 2017 election and again last month. The environment was named by just under 10 percent in 2017 but has jumped to 25 percent for 2019 — the same as the economy. (Brexit was top in both polls.)

2019-11-15 08:53:03-05:00,Microgrids Take Off Among Airport Operators,"On December 17, 2017, a fire at an underground electrical facility damaged two substations that serve Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport — then and now the world’s busiest airport. The resulting 11-hour-long power outage led to the cancellation of nearly 1,200 flights. The Atlanta outage, and another that disrupted power for several hours at Los Angeles International Airport in June of this year, is motivating airport operators across the United States to take steps to ensure an uninterruptible supply of power. In this quest for more reliable power, an increasing number of airports are turning to microgrids — self-contained grids capable of operating independently from the traditional grid. In the latest such project, Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT) will become the first major American airport to be 100 percent powered by a microgrid . In an interview, Tom Woodrow, VP of engineering, Allegheny County Airport Authority, said being able to maintain operations and always be open for business was top of mind for Pittsburgh’s airport. “The primary goal was to avoid being the next Atlanta or LA and to be able to get that resilience and reliability.",CNX,en,Green Technology
