They're all owned by Authentic Brands Group. Next question: What is Authentic Brands Group?

As the only media entity in ABG's portfolio, it appears to be an outlier. But ABG didn't buy Sports Illustrated because it wanted to run a magazine, it bought it because it's a good brand. ""Our vision is, how do we take arguably the most famous sports brand that's meant a lot to a lot of people, and create a 21st-century media brand,"" Marc Rosen, the executive vice president for ABG's business unit, told Business Insider in an interview.
