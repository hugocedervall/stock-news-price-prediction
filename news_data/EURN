2020-06-28 05:08:36-05:00,It’s time to wave goodbye to bonanza crude oil trade,"By Firat KayakiranAn oil trade that made its way into Donald Trump’s press briefings -- and earned big profits for commodity merchants and tanker owners alike -- is fading away with every dollar that the price of crude rallies.When oil demand cratered earlier this year because of the coronavirus and a flood of cargoes, the U.S. president talked about “oil all over the oceans.” It was a reference to the tens of millions of barrels of unwanted crude that traders were hoarding on ships at profit. Tanker owners including Frontline Ltd. and Euronav NV also reaped windfalls as a frenzy to book the ships on storage charters drove up rates.Those days are done. The big financial incentive to store, known in trader jargon as contango, has all but vanished. Worse still for tanker owners: it’s disappeared partly because the OPEC+ oil-producer alliance has drastically curtailed the supply of cargoes. In other words, no incentive to store and fewer shipments.“For now, this play is largely over,” said Richard Matthews, an analyst who monitors the trade at E.A.",EURN,en,Economic Times India
2020-06-08 16:33:09-05:00,Can Shipping Shares Catch Wave Of (Ir)rational Exuberance?,"To the growing bewilderment of skeptics, equities continue their rally, trading as if the recovery is nigh, there will be no second-wave lockdowns, and government largesse will offset unemployment. The S&P 500 closed at 3,232on Monday, up 44% from its March 23 low and down less than 1% year-to-date (YTD), effectively erasing its losses for the year. ""The broader equity market is beginning to buy into the idea of a rapid recovery to the extent which just two months ago I would never have believed possible, and frankly [I] am still a little guarded,"" acknowledged Stifel shipping analyst Ben Nolan in a research note on Sunday. Stifel's Ben Nolan (Photo: Chris Preovolos/Marine Money) ""The confidence in a broader market recovery expressed by the sharp improvement in the S&P has not translated into nearly the same magnitude within the shipping equities,"" he said. ""Average tanker names under coverage are down 33% YTD, average container names are down 31%, and average dry bulk names are down 41%. ""Transportation as a sector has lagged the broader market, but still, the S&P transportation index, which is mostly railroads, airlines, and trucking companies, is only down 7% through the year, so clearly [ocean] shipping is underperforming by any measure. ""If the broader equities are correct in predicting a rapid recovery of economic activity, shipping equities could be poised for a substantial catchup trade and outperformance,"" he concluded.",EURN,en,Benzinga Feeds

Plunging oil demand has precipitated surging tanker demand. As the saying goes, ""One man's misfortune is another man's fortune.""

2020-04-23 15:03:40-05:00,Iran Threat Looms As Tanker Market Booms,"It was October 2019, just six months ago, but ancient history for tanker trades. Rates for very large crude carriers (VLCCs, tankers that carry 2 million barrels of crude oil) spiked to $200,000 per day. Tension in the Middle East was a key driver. The threat that military action with Iran could halt tanker transits via the Strait of Hormuz spurred fear that oil prices could skyrocket. This prompted shippers to pull bookings forward, boosting VLCC demand and rates. The world has turned upside down since then. Today, low crude prices are driving tanker rates above $200,000 per day. As the coronavirus cripples oil demand, an unprecedented wave of petroleum is going to sea, whether intentionally for storage or unintentionally because cargo owners can't find anywhere to unload. The more laden tankers on the water, the fewer available to bid on the next spot deal and the higher the spot rate. If oil prices bounce back up, it would be negative for tanker sentiment — exactly the opposite of what happened in October.",EURN,en,Benzinga Feeds

2019-11-27 09:19:00-05:00,Shipping's Spot-Rate Model Could Collide With Green Agenda,"The past two months have offered a textbook example of just how much stock investors crave the volatility of ocean shipping spot markets. Spot rates for very large crude carriers (VLCCs, tankers designed to carry 2 million barrels of crude oil) skyrocketed from $50,000 per day at the end of September to around $200,000 per day on Oct. 11, dropped back to $60,000 by mid-November and have now popped back above $100,000 per day. It's hard to find other markets to bet on that gyrate to this extreme. Tanker stocks with exposure to these spot rates have surged in response. This deep-seated focus on spot rates — not just among public and private investors but also among commodity charterers — could complicate plans to reduce the shipping industry's carbon footprint in the years ahead, a move that will almost certainly require much more time-charter coverage. Penalizing Period Charters Investors react negatively when ship owners do not have enough exposure to soaring spot rates. Case in point: the stock of Tsakos Energy Navigation or TEN (NYSE: TNP ), one of the largest tanker owners in the public market, which has lagged its compatriots, not just because it focuses on smaller vessel classes, but also because of its higher time-charter coverage.",EURN,en,Benzinga Feeds

2019-11-07 14:09:57-05:00,Shipping Earnings Roundup: Here Come The Dividends,"In the recent flood of earnings reports by U.S.-listed ocean shipping companies, common themes have risen to the surface: Third-quarter results are still in the red and weaker than expected, earnings are being impaired by out-of-service time due to exhaust-gas scrubber installations, rates are up sharply in the fourth quarter – and most importantly, as sentiment brightens, dividends are now back in vogue. Here Come The Dividends ""We think the reemergence of dividends will become a major theme in shipping equity markets over the next 12 months as companies institute and grow payouts in response to firming day rates and cleaned-up balance sheets across the group,"" asserted Amit Mehrotra, transportation analyst of Deutsche Bank, in a new client note. Dry bulk owner Genco Shipping & Trading (NYSE: GNK ) has just announced instituted a regular dividend of $0.175 per quarter – its first regular dividend since 2008 – plus a special dividend of $0.325 per share.

2019-10-29 14:21:03-05:00,Euronav Sees Rising Constraints On Supertanker Capacity,"There are usually more bulk ships on the high seas than cargoes for them to carry, ergo weak returns for vessel owners. Every once in a while, though, the balance tightens and an unexpected chain of events sends moribund freight rates through the roof. That's what just happened with very large crude carriers (VLCCs, tankers that carry 2 million barrels of crude oil), and conditions are still ripe for more VLCC rate spikes in the months ahead due to constraints on tanker capacity that could extend well into 2020. Executives of crude-tanker owner Euronav (NYSE: EURN ) outlined three rising capacity constraints during their quarterly call with analysts on Oct. 29: heightened floating storage, delays for exhaust-gas scrubber installations, and uncertainty over newbuilding designs. Floating Storage is Up On Jan. 1, the IMO 2020 rule goes into effect, requiring the use of fuel with sulfur content of 0.5% or less aboard all ships not equipped with exhaust-gas scrubbers. This will split the market into those using scrubbers and staying with 3.5% sulfur heavy fuel oil (HFO) on one hand and those switching to blended 0.5% sulfur low-sulfur fuel oil (LSFO) or 0.1% marine gas oil (MGO) on the other.",EURN,en,Benzinga Feeds
