The bank's head of derivatives research has been skeptical throughout the recent 35% surge in the S&P, urging clients to fade the rally or simply to ignore it, as highlighted in recent posts: The Higher Stocks Rise, The More Fragile The Market Becomes "" Fade The Rip"": BofA Warns ""Bear Market Far From Over Unless We Escape A Recession"" Here Is The One Indicator That Convinced BofA Another Market Crash Is Coming To be sure Bowler is not alone, because as the latest BofA Fund Manager Survey showed , a sizable majority (68%) of investors still believe this is a bear market which would make this a bear market rally (arguably one of the fastest on record) despite the S&P crossing the psychologically important 3,000 level and breaking above what historical analogs suggest as bear-rally peaks. As such, in his latest note the BofA strategist writes that ""the pain trade is clearly up"", which reinforced by weak fundamentals (BofA economists downgraded their global growth forecasts again last week following a worsening projection by the IMF earlier in May), means that ""the risk is getting forced into chasing a reflexive bubble in a late-stage bear-market rally."" The liquidity easing provided by policymakers is likely helping to create a disconnect between fundamentals and asset prices, as investors are forced deeper into the risk spectrum.",AFL,en,Zero Hedge
2020-05-27 17:17:59,Bank of America warns a new bubble may be forming in the stock market — and shares a cheap strategy for protection that is 'significantly' more profitable than during the last 10 years,"The attractiveness of US assets relative to the rest of the world is brewing a bubble in the stock market, according to equity-derivatives strategists at Bank of America. They formulated a cheap strategy designed to profit from limited gains in some of the worst-performing stocks. Click here for more BI Prime stories . Stock-market rallies do not have to be as monumental as the dot-com boom in order to qualify as bubbles. For equity-derivatives strategists at Bank of America, the forces lifting the market higher are powerful enough to potentially make stocks vastly overpriced. None of these catalysts is hard to dismiss — even for bearish investors who doubt that the economy will quickly recover from the coronavirus crisis in a V-shaped manner. Most importantly, the US has provided more monetary and fiscal support than any other country during this downturn and made the appeal of its financial assets irresistible. The concern shared by Bank of America is these gains could prompt investors to dust off a playbook that worked after the 2008 financial crisis: buying price dips and betting that weaknesses will be short-lived.",AFL,en,Business Insider
