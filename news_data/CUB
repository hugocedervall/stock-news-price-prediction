Its deposits and advances grew by 5% and 7% respectively y-o-y. While its net interest income (NII) moved up by 5% y-o-y, its net profit fell by 17%. A lower than expected increase of 6% in operating expenditure due to cost control measures and higher treasury gains of Rs 78 crore as compared to Rs 30 crore during same period last year are the major reasons behind this.However, analysts are getting bullish on CUB, due to improvement in its asset quality profiles. Its loans under full moratorium came down to 12% from 52% in the previous quarter. Considering the fact that CUB has a high share of loans towards micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), this is a significantly better performance compared to its peers.The real asset quality situation of the banking industry will be known only after the moratorium ends on 31 August and the next restructuring phase begins.",CUB,en,Economic Times India
