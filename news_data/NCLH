Observers wondered whether mega-lines like Carnival, prevented from sailing in US waters by CDC edicts since March, might even survive. It wasn't just passenger tickets and onboard meals that businesses like Carnival were losing out on. Luxury retail at Carnival alone is thought to make up $300 million, according to one expert . And those losses in retail made up part of Carnival's 50% decline in revenue in the 12 months ending on August 2020 . Malls have become a mainstay of mega-ship design, from duty-free staples like liquor and tobacco to onboard galleries selling prints and paintings and an increasing number of branded boutiques from luxury marques like Bulgari. There was a glimmer of hope when the CDC lifted its sailing ban. But incidents like the one on the private cruise line SeaDream , where positive COVID-19 cases popped up despite precautions, have confirmed that the cruise industry's recovery will be a long and complicated one.",NCLH,en,Business Insider
