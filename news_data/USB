2020-04-14 05:15:00-05:00,How to tell whether a USB-C cable can carry high-wattage power and Thunderbolt 3 data,"USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 are no longer new technology. But the similarities and differences can still wind up confusing even long-time users of the Mac. Where this tends to manifest itself these days isn’t so much with connectors and adapters, but with power. Some cables with USB-C connectors can carry data, video, and networking traffic while also supplying low-wattage power to USB devices. They’re capable of charging iPhones and iPads, but not maintaining or recharging an Apple laptop. Others cables with the same connectors can pass up up 29W (watts), 30W, or 100W of power—but may be limited to USB 2.0 data transfer speeds…or might handle anything built into the Thunderbolt 3 specification including 100W of juice!

As more of us ""cut the cord"" and turn to streaming media services , we are also discovering that we don't need to be tethered to traditional televisions. Home theater projectors are an increasingly attractive alternative due to their ability to render a broad range of image sizes. With that in mind, projectors are a perfect solution for buyers who want a truly big screen experience in their home. I've relied on projectors for watching movies and shows for five years now, and the Epson Home Cinema 3800 4K 3LCD Projector is the best I've used.",USB,en,Business Insider

In the article, it described how the man had retired in the last year because of cancer. Then, two days later, my wife asked me if I had read the article. When I said that I had, she responded: “ Scary, huh? He was healthy .” I replied: “ What do you mean? He had underlying issues “. And when we logged-on to read the article again, it was tagged as “updated 7 hours ago” and many of the words I’d read two nights before were…. gone. In the paragraph where it said he retired, it mentioned nothing of his cancer and instead described how the man was “active and enjoyed riding his bike”. Of course, even a tin-foil-hat-wearing blogger like me would have a hard time believing that any conspiratorial pressure could be applied to my local paper.

Kuo believes that Arm-based processors will significantly enhance the competitive advantage of the Mac lineup, allow Apple to refresh its Mac models without relying on Intel's processor roadmap, reduce processor costs by 40 to 60 percent, and provide Macs with more hardware differentiation from Windows PCs. Earlier this month, Kuo said Apple's first Mac notebooks with Arm-based processors will launch in the fourth quarter of 2020 or the first quarter of 2021 . Kuo expects ASMedia Technology to become the exclusive supplier of USB controllers for Arm-based Macs, adding that the Taiwanese integrated circuit designer will benefit from Macs gaining support for USB4 in 2022.

Areca's 30-meter optical Thunderbolt 3 cable There is an alternative to copper cables that allows for longer cable lengths, and that's optical fiber cables, which use light to transmit signals over long distances with high fidelity. While there have been optical versions of Thunderbolt 1 and 2 cables, the Thunderbolt 3 standard has been very slow in seeing optical cables come to market.

It started with the MacBook Pro and the new 12-inch MacBook, which had only one USB-C port that had to be used for both power and peripherals. That was a frustration, but the reasoning for dumping USB-A seemed sound: USB-C was the obvious future. One port that is smaller, thinner, reversible and easier to plug in, that guaranteed high-speed USB 3.0 speeds, and maybe even other stuff like Thunderbolt connectivity. Just as Apple did when it dropped serial and parallel ports with the original iMac in favor of only USB, it was embracing the obvious future, and pressuring the rest of the industry to keep up.

But the Galaxy S20 flagships will apparently be more expensive than we expected , so you'll have to pay a pretty penny if you want to see what Samsung has in store for the next generation. On the other hand, if you're shopping for a budget phone capable of pulling off a 120Hz screen, you're in luck, especially if you happen to live in India. Poco, a Xiaomi offshoot that recently became its own company, launched the Poco F1 last year -- a super-affordable flagship that was even cheaper than the latest OnePlus 7 phones. Going forward, the company plans to launch a successor to the F1 , which comes with a brand new name -- the Poco X2 -- and it will be unveiled in just a few days. The company mounted a massive marketing campaign to tease a phone that's supposed to be ""smooth AF"" according to the clever website that demands to be loaded up on a smartphone rather than a computer.",USB,en,BGR.com
2020-01-27 09:56:16-05:00,Apple is under pressure to kill the iPhone's Lightning charger — but here's why that probably won't happen anytime soon (AAPL),"The EU is pushing for the adoption of a common charging cable that would work across all types of smartphones, a measure that would likely require Apple to switch from its proprietary Lightning charging method to USB-C. Apple has pushed back against such regulation, saying that it would stifle innovation and pose an inconvenience to consumers. There are several reasons why Apple isn't likely to ditch the more than 7-years-old Lightning cable unless it has to. For example, doing so would cause a headache for iPhone accessory makers. It's also uncharacteristic for Apple to adopt a technology just because the rest of the industry is — without making some improvements or changes to it. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. Apple is facing pressure to ditch the Lightning port on its iPhones as the European Union pushes for smartphone makers to adopt a universal charging standard that works across all devices. Such a move would signal the first major update to the technology Apple uses for powering its line of smartphones since it introduced Lightning in 2012.",USB,en,Business Insider

All three phones, however, will have a slightly tweaked design compared to last year’s S10 series, and that includes different sizes for all of them. The Galaxy S20 will feature a hole-punch display like the Galaxy S10, but the selfie cam is placed in the middle rather than on the side, which makes the S20 look more like the Note 10.",USB,en,BGR.com

All of them support USB-C Power Delivery for fast charging, and they all have folding prongs.

The Lightning port replaced the 30-pin connector on the iPhone 5, and a few years later the iPhone 7 killed the 3.5mm headphone jack.

It’s not the lightest battery pack, weighing in at 1.4 pounds, and I definitely notice that it’s in my bag, but it has essentially replaced the power strip I would bring with me on trips. Note: This review is part of our roundup of portable power banks . Go there for details on competing products and our testing methods. On the front of the Sherpa 100PD is a USB-C Power Delivery (PD) port, two USB-A ports, a power button, a display that shows the pack’s numerical charge level, and a button that turns on wireless charging. The USB-C port is two-way, meaning that you use it to both charge the pack itself and to charge Power Delivery devices. Included in the box is a USB-A to USB-C cable.

2019-12-03 06:00:00-05:00,Microsoft Surface Pro X review: This isn't the long-lasting tablet we were hoping for,"Microsoft’s Surface Pro X was supposed to signal a new chapter for Qualcomm’s foray into Windows PCs and tablets, one where battery life was no longer the sole selling point. To its credit, the new, semi-custom Microsoft SQ1 chip (based on the Snapdragon 8cx) delivers improvements in graphics and performance. We also appreciate the appearance of USB-C and a marvelously-engineered pen cubby. But in a baffling turn of events, the Surface Pro X falls short in battery life. Meanwhile, the app compatibility issues and bugs that are an unfortunate staple of Snapdragon-powered PCs remain. Maybe it can be tolerated in a system like the Samsung Galaxy Book 2 , which delivered 18 hours of battery life. But not the Surface Pro X, with a mere 8 to 10 hours. The tired chant of “this is a new architecture, give it some time,” doesn’t fly anymore. When a bug or another issue pops up—and it probably will—it’s painful.

While that sounds scary, it may be nothing to worry about. Back in 2013, security researchers showed that a mini computer disguised as a USB charging brick could install data-stealing malware on iPhones, which at the time were running iOS 6 or earlier. Apple took notice and promptly closed the loophole in iOS 7 . In another attack, called video jacking, what looks like a USB port is actually equipped to pull HDMI video from devices, allowing hackers to copy everything you do on the screen, such as enter passwords. This kind of attack has been shown to work, but has never been seen in the wild.

Extension cords aren't glamorous. They aren't interesting or exciting, and you probably don't spend much time thinking about them in the course of any given day. But when you need an extension cord — whether to power a leaf blower or saw, to light up the trees and roofline of your property with thousands of festive lights, or to connect the television to an outlet across the room — having the right extension cord is the difference between a quick and easy solution and serious bout of frustration. The good news is that most well-made extension cords will last for years and years. When considering which is the best extension cord for your needs, think about where you will use it (inside at home, inside at work, outside in a static placement, or outside moving around during use), when you will use it (for winter holiday lights, fall leaf blowing, or summer weed trimming, e.g.) and what devices will be connected to the cord (how many amps does that skill saw need for ideal performance, again?).",USB,en,Business Insider

That's still the case, but today's budget laptops are now plenty capable of doing what most people need — word processing, web browsing, and emailing — thanks to improvements in processors, graphics, and other chipsets, as well as standardization in features like USB and HDMI.

You can also plug a USB-C charging cable directly into the Switch while you're playing it in handheld mode. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . The Nintendo Switch's portability sets it apart from all other home consoles. Even after you disconnect it from its screen, you can keep playing, no matter where you go. But if your Switch runs out of battery, the fun is over until you get back to a power source. And unfortunately, the Switch's battery life isn't tremendously long — on an original Nintendo Switch, you'll usually get between three and nine hours of active use, depending on how hardware intensive the game you're playing is. The Switch Lite will give you three to seven hours. However, charging your Switch back to full power only takes about three and a half hours.",USB,en,Business Insider

The PS4 uses the Dualshock 4 controller by default, and all PS4 games are designed to use it.

All games on your PlayStation 4 are built to be played with the default controller, called the Dualshock 4. It's a well-made controller, and for most games, it's a great option. However, if you're used to playing PC games, you might be used to the precision of a keyboard and mouse instead. Luckily, the PS4 supports keyboard and mouse controls — sometimes. Some games can be played with a keyboard and mouse, but many don't allow it. In fact, most won't — some, like Call of Duty, will even ban you from multiplayer if you use them, because a keyboard and mouse give a competitive advantage. Few games natively support keyboard and mouse, but you will be able to use it to navigate the system menus, and use the PS4's web browser with it.",USB,en,Business Insider

The Mophie Powerstation XL external battery is one of my most essential items, but it's admittedly a hassle to carry. I found a great solution with another Mophie product. The Mophie Juice Pack Access is the brand's newest charging case available for the latest generation of iPhones X, Xs, Xs Max, and Xr. It uses wireless charging to give and receive a charge, so it works completely independent of the lightning port. At $99.99, the Mophie Juice Pack Access is a convenient and cost-effective alternative to buying a good case and separate external battery. It's also cheaper and better-looking than Apple's $129 battery case . In more ways than I'm willing to count, smartphones have become the center of our lives.

We think the Libratone Zipp 2 Mini is the best speaker for those that want something portable and relatively small. AirPlay 2-enabled speakers have slowly but surely become more popular and accessible; there are a lot of options that give you high-quality, multi-room audio straight from your iPhone without having to install other apps.

Apple's 13-inch MacBook Pro from 2017, with no Touch Bar, might be one of the best laptops Apple has ever made. The computer is powerful, but also sleek, thin, and quiet.

Wireless headphones provide an alternative for those times when the device's charging port is already in use. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . The tech world has a way of cannibalizing itself: Trends become standards, and progress is made. Apple was the first to announce that it would forego the headphone jack in favor of a wireless future — despite pushback from iPhone users due to the ubiquity of the jack and the fact that removing it entirely meant removing their ability to choose what sort of headphones to use. Apple's announcement came months before the original Google Pixel, which features a standard headphone jack, made its debut on the phone market in October 2016. Samsung responded to Apple's move with criticism — before doing a sharp course-correction and removing the jack from some of their phone models as well .",USB,en,Business Insider
