Back in September, shortly after the Fed unleashed the "" Not QE "" meltup in markets (which despite the Fed's most valiant effort to pretend was not QE ended up being steamrolled by the unlimited QE which has since bought $2 trillion in Tsys and MBS in the past 2 months), we wrote that when it comes to the ""fair value"" of stocks, nobody knows it better than insiders, who tend to aggressively offload shares any time they see the price of their equity holdings as generously high. Which, as we pointed out, was a problem for the bulls as ""executives across the US are shedding stock in their own companies at the fastest pace in two decades, amid concerns that the long bull market in equities is reaching its final stages."" To wit: at the end of Q3 2019, corporate insiders - CEOs, CFOs, and board members, but also venture capital and other early state investors - sold a combined $19BN of stock in their companies YTD.",KMI,en,Zero Hedge

2020-04-02 12:19:11-05:00,The top 25 oil and gas companies lost more than $810 billion in the last three months. Here's a ranking of the biggest losers.,"Energy stocks crashed over the last three months as the coronavirus pandemic cratered demand for oil, according to new data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The top 25 oil and gas companies lost an eye-popping $811 billion altogether in market capitalization between the end of 2019 to the end of March 2020. Those remarkable losses are sending the industry spiraling , with companies filing for bankruptcy , firing staff, and slashing their 2020 capital expenditure . Using data provided by S&P, Business Insider ranked the top oil and gas companies by market cap loss in the last three months as a percent. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . Energy stocks crashed in the first three months of 2020, falling by more than 50%, according to a report published earlier this week by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The broader S&P 500 slid, as well, by about 20%, the firm said. What that looks like in dollars is especially striking. The top 25 oil and gas companies by market capitalization at the end of March lost an eye-popping $811 billion in just three months, falling from a total market capitalization of nearly $2 trillion at the end of last year.",KMI,en,Business Insider

While we are still waiting for the first big activist to take a swing - or the first signs of large M&A that can sometimes come with selloffs, there's one group of people that aren't waiting to pull the trigger. Executives are hitting the clearance rack and buying shares of their own companies at what Bloomberg calls a ""breakneck"" pace during the first couple of weeks of March. The total purchased has exceeded the last two months combined and insider buys are outpacing sales by the most since 2011. Megan Horneman, director of portfolio strategy at Verdence Capital Advisors commented: “When insiders are buying, they think their companies are well undervalued. It can be a good sign that we’re trying to find a bottom around here -- not necessarily that it is the bottom but at least that we’re trying to find the bottom here.” The S&P 500 is now trading at a 14% discount to its 5 year average, which could perhaps be why almost 1,400 executives have bought shares of their own companies .",KMI,en,Zero Hedge

In "" Hunting Angels: What The World's Most Bearish Hedge Fund Will Short Next"", we quoted from the IMF's Oct 2017 "" Global Financial Stability Report"" which issued an ominous warning: … BBB bonds now make up nearly 50% of the index of investment grade bonds, an all time high. BBB bonds are only one notch above high yield, and are at the greatest risk of becoming fallen angels, that is bonds that were investment grade when issued, but subsequently get downgraded to below investment grade, or what is known these days as high yield. It then points out that investors have never been more at risk of capital loss if yields were to rise. In addition, it notes volatility targeting investors will mechanically increase leverage as volatility drops, with variable annuities investors having little flexibility to deviate from target volatility Following this article, the topic of a tsunami in ""fallen angel"" credits took on greater urgency, because with over $3 trillion in bonds on the cusp of downgrade , as we discussed in "" The $6.4 Trillion Question: How Many BBB Bonds Are About To Be Downgraded "", countless asset managers warned ( here , here and here ) that this was the biggest threat to the credit pillar of both the US economy and stock market (recall the bulk of BBB rated issuance was used to fund the trillions in buybacks that levitated the stock market over the past few years).",KMI,en,Zero Hedge
