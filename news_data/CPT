2020-08-18 10:02:00-05:00,A Conversation with a Short Seller,"A short seller leads a lonely life, it seems. Short sellers profit from stocks that decline in value. So, when they win, it means that most of their friends and family are likely losing. And when they lose? Well … they don't generally get a lot of sympathy. After all, they made money while the rest of us lost our shirts. Suffice it to say, it takes a special type of person to hack it as a short seller. You have to have a contrarian mindset and exceptionally thick skin. And today, I had the pleasure of speaking with one of the all-time living greats in this space, David Tice. David is a forensic accountant with a history of sniffing out fraud and overly aggressive accounting, and he previously managed the Prudent Bear Fund In 2008, he exited the industry by selling his mutual fund business at the top (for short sellers!) just as the crisis was bottoming. Now, after more than a decade in hibernation and after a huge bull market run, David has decided to get back into the short selling business and recently became the Chief Investment Officer of the AdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear ETF ( HDGE ).",CPT,en,Kiplinger Washington Editors
