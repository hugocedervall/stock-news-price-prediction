2020-12-09 21:25:00-05:00,Reseller Bot Software Is Making It Impossible To Buy A Playstation 5 Online In Time For The Holidays,"Reseller Bot Software Is Making It Impossible To Buy A Playstation 5 Online In Time For The Holidays Tyler Durden Wed, 12/09/2020 - 21:25 The surge of e-commerce comes with numerous new positives: you can shop at home, you don't have to go outside during a pandemic and items are shipped right to your door. But now, as some Christmas shoppers are finding out, it also comes with some brand new negatives - including bots that have been tasked with buying up every new ""hot"" Christmas item as soon as it goes on sale online with major retailers. Such has been the case with items like the Playstation 5, which has been bought up on sites by bots that ""resellers use to snatch up products online and relist them moments later at significant mark-ups on eBay and Amazon Marketplace,"" according to Reuters . And with most people shopping from home this year, the total addressable market for online resellers has never been bigger. 26 year old Benjamin Karmis from Illinois, who has been trying for weeks to buy a Playstation 5, said: “There is no possible way that I could have been more prepared to get one, and I have failed every single time.” And it's not just Playstations the bots are looking to buy.",GME,en,Zero Hedge

Stores will start to sell more PS5 stock, although supply is expected to be limited. Retailers will not sell the PS5 in retail locations, but only online. Walmart and Target will both stock the two PS5 versions on release day. The lucky gamers who were able to preorder the PS5 several weeks ago during Sony’s deeply flawed PlayStation 5 preorder launch will soon get the console version of their choosing or the one that was still in stock when they attempted to buy one. Both the PS5 and PS5 Digital Edition ship to buyers on Thursday and they also launch in stores. However, this isn’t the launch that Sony envisioned for its biggest console launch since the PS4. It all happens during a massive pandemic. The novel coronavirus is infected hundreds of thousands of people each day worldwide, with the US alone accounting for well over 100,000 daily new cases. This makes any in-store launch event practically impossible, no matter what the product is.",GME,en,BGR

After his father suffered a heart attack in 2017, Cohen made a series of tough calls to spend more time with him: scrapping plans to take Chewy public, selling the company for $3.4 billion, and resigning as CEO the following year. Cohen broke with convention again by investing the vast majority of his wealth in two stocks , Apple and Wells Fargo, and later placing a contrarian bet on ailing video-game retailer GameStop. The entrepreneur attributes his independent streak to the ""two biggest influences on my professional life"": his father, Ted Cohen, who passed away last December, and Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO. ""Something critical that I learned from my dad and Warren Buffett was the ability to separate myself from the herd and think independently,"" Cohen told Business Insider this week. The pair's teachings allow him to ""block out the noise, develop my own point of view, and not be influenced by daily headlines or the consensus or what's in style."" For example, many people initially doubted Chewy would be able to ship 30-pound bags of pet food to customers and make any money. ""In the early years, few investors thought Chewy was a good idea,"" Cohen said. ""I struck out raising capital over 100 times."" Ignoring the skeptics, as well as avoiding distractions and saying ""no"" to all but the best opportunities, enabled Cohen to focus on the things most critical to Chewy's success: competitive prices, compelling products, fast shipping, and personalized customer service.",GME,en,Business Insider

2019-03-16 05:55:40-05:00,Here's how a tiny toymaker dodged the Toys R Us disaster that whacked Hasbro and Mattel (FNKO),"Toys R Us store closures and liquidation sales hammered Hasbro, Mattel, Spin Master and Jakks Pacific last year. Funko was hardly affected due to its large and diversified customer base, multiple sales channels, and devoted shoppers. The liquidation of Toys R Us and closure of more than 800 of its toy stores hammered Hasbro, Mattel, Spin Master and Jakks Pacific last year, as their recent results show. The only major toy stock to escape the fallout was Funko, thanks to its diversified customer base, range of sales channels, and devoted buyers. How did Funko dodge the Toys R Us bullet? In stark contrast to its peers, Funko's sales jumped 33% to $686 million last financial year, driving operating profit up 51% to $63.5 million. Funko - which makes pop-culture figurines and bobbleheads under licence from Disney, Netflix, Nintendo, Warner Bros. and others - relied on Toys R Us for less than 4% of its sales in 2017, meaning its sales were hardly affected by the retailer's sudden demise. The key differences between Funko and rivals are that its "" products are channel-agnostic, and we have a diverse set of customers, of which no retailer accounts for more than 10% of our year's sales to date,"" CEO Brian Mariotti said on the group's third-quarter earnings call . ""Because of this, we have been successful in regaining any sales we would have lost because of [Toys R Us] with other retailers."" Funko doesn't publicly break out its sales channels.",GME,en,Business Insider

Hestia and Permit, which combined own 1.3% of GameStop shares outstanding, sent a letter to the company's board sharing concerns regarding the ""dramatic underperformance"" of the stock. They said they believe a fair value of the company is ""at least"" $19 per share, which is 70% above Wednesday's closing price.
