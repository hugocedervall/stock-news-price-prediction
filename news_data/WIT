Both the promoters or one promoter and the other group of Tata Sons would like some liquidity and that is also driving this.

So in the nearly $4 trillion dollar global IT pie, digital, automation, work from home, cloud and remote working are getting a lot of scope.

It is vital to ask, using such criteria, whether we are creating ‘sustainable finance’ today.The measures are clear. If you are financing a coal-based power station, that is not sustainable finance. That undermines natural capital, and damages human capital with its negative health impacts. Finance also should be sound from the point of view of risk and return – that soundness is shaped by what finance is financing. As an example, in the last four years, the US stock market has gone up by about 50% – yet, oil and gas companies have come down by around 50%.",WIT,en,Economic Times India

It is still doing quite well,” Gopinathan said. “Its relevance will increase significantly as we go into a distributed operating model.”Ignio is part of TCS-owned Digitate and helps companies reduce outages by identifying potential hotspots for failure in their networks.“The ability to look forward and predict where the hotspot is, the ability to look backwards and say where the core problem is, is one of the critical features of Ignio,” Gopinathan added. “Now, take that into a distributed operating model of an enterprise, because when you're using that for a server, you could as well use it for any distributed asset or any distributed resource that the enterprise has.”Ignio was expanded from Ignio AIOps to include four other products in the last year.It was a central product in the software exporter’s large deals in the previous fiscal year, said chief operating officer NG Subramaniam.“At the core is Ignio, our cognitive automation software, which can autonomously pre-empt or resolve system failures…The benefits were especially visible in the retail vertical during the holiday season peak and again during the panic shopping in March,” he said.Analysts said the market for such ‘self-healing’ software products will become bigger due to new work arrangements caused by the Covid-19 virus outbreak.IBM introduced its Watson AIOps last month, while Infosys' NIA and Wipro’s Holmes compete for market share.",WIT,en,Economic Times India

Business continuity plans typically allow a subset of employees to work from home, with work also getting distributed to other cities as employees travel between them. But the spread of Covid-19 to multiple metro cities could result in centres across the country shutting down, requiring broader work-from-home authorisations. “We need the waivers because some service agreements stipulate a high level of security in the development centre. Some employees have WFH (work-from-home) authorisations, but we have not prepared country-wide work-from-home requirements,” a senior IT services executive said. He said clients were open to issuing the waivers but there were some projects that were governed by stricter privacy and data security laws that were harder to transition.",WIT,en,The Economic Times India

The move could trigger business disruption for Bengaluru’s IT companies that generate over a third of India’s software exports of $ 147 billion. The state health department has also sought details on employees who have travelled to Covid-19- affected countries since February 21.“We had earlier advised technology companies to avoid sending employees to foreign countries,” state health minister B Sriramulu told ET. “We are (now) telling them not to send any employees, unless it is an emergency,” he said.The government has not yet issued a formal letter in this regard. The state’s IT&BT director Prashant Kumar Mishra said that his department has not received any communication on the ban. 74568438 “We will implement the ban if the health department asks us to,” he said.Two of India’s top four technology services companies, Infosys and Wipro, are based in Bengaluru.B’luru Home to Many Tech MNCsThe city is also home to several multinational technology majors such as Intel, Dell, Microsoft, Google and SAP Labs, whose executives and engineers typically travel overseas to locations in the US and Europe for meetings and short-term projects.In 2019, 4.87 million passengers travelled to overseas locations from Bengaluru and back, a growth of 14% over the previous year.Over a dozen technology companies, including Infosys, Wipro, Accenture and Intel, declined comment on ET’s queries over the issue.Analysts are of the view that Karnataka’s directive is in line with similar moves by global technology firms that have issued a ban on (avoidable) travel by employees to stem the tide of rising infections worldwide.“The Covid-19 is a serious health issue the world is facing.",WIT,en,The Economic Times India
2020-03-08 21:52:02-05:00,Wipro plans a fresh shot at a ‘Quantum’ digital leap,"BENGALURU: Wipro, which missed last year’s deadline for its internal digital transformation, is expected to operationalise it across departments this year, company executives told ET.The Bengaluru-headquartered software services exporter had planned for Quantum — as the project is known — to go live across all departments by August last year, sources privy to the matter told ET.Wipro is trying to create a global identity for itself as a digital technology services provider.Quantum, initiated after an external audit, includes transformation of various processes and operations across finance, sales, delivery, human resources and other departments.For example, the company has made a single process of employee onboarding across all geographies.“The company has so far invested heavily on implementation of SAP HANA applications across departments. This has seen sluggish growth across the organisation. While the finance department under (CFO) Jatin Dalal has taken a lead, other departments are seeing slow growth,” one of the people, who did not want to be named, said.Quantum is meant to closely appraise the size of teams across departments and bring in technology to speed up operations.Analysts, however, said such transformations were not easy and that change management creates challenges more than technology.“…It (slow progress) is not unusual….what Wipro is finding out is that it is not the technology that creates the problem, but the change management,” said Peter Bendor-Samuel, chief executive officer of Everest Group, a global IT advisory and research firm.“I see this as a typical digital transformation, and a great learning for Wipro,” he added.Responding to ET’s queries, Wipro CFO Dalal said that the company has implemented Quantum phase-wise, with three to four large “sprints” done in 2019, and that it would go live this year.“We realised that digital was growing leaps and bounds and we felt the need to transform internally.",WIT,en,The Economic Times India

On board were top executives of a Mumbai-based company in the banking and finance sector, who were in the Nepal capital for an important meeting.As the aircraft rose to nearly 25,000 feet, there were exclamations of delight from the executives, each of whom was seated next to a window and were also allowed to wander into the cockpit for a better view. Spread out below was the panorama of a line of snow-capped peaks, including Mount Everest.To top it off, as the one-hour flight landed back in Kathmandu, the passengers were served flutes of champagne. “For many, the whole experience came as a surprise,” says Baljeet Gujral, founder of BucketList Experiences from Mumbai, who had organised the trip.Whether it is board meetings, a huddle with vertical heads to discuss the next year’s strategy or an attempt to foster synergy among top executives otherwise spread across geographies, the corporate getaway for senior management has been changing over the last couple of years, according to travel industry executives.73206661 As more Indians travel abroad (one estimate suggests this number will be 50 million in 2020) and their appetite for unconventional destinations and experiences goes up, boutique travel firms say this trend has now spread to corporate offsites for the top deck.BucketList, whose clients include Standard Chartered, Wipro and Emirates, organises two to three such board meetings every quarter at “unexplored” destinations, which offer interesting recreational activities.“Companies no longer want to do these high-level meetings at beach resorts in the Maldives or Mauritius.",WIT,en,The Economic Times India

Over the last few months, Tech Mahindra and Wipro said that they would set up centres in Finland, while HCL Technologies has been present there for a decade now. Infosys, in addition to working with companies in the region, got a foothold in the market through its acquisition of Fluido in 2018.The Nordic countries — Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland — are largely English speaking, which removes the language barrier that exists in some other countries within continental Europe.Even as they are bound by EU guidelines, these countries are making it easier for foreign nationals to move there, given the shortage of highskilled local talent.73147714 “The Nordic region of Europe is definitely one of the most progressive and innovative regions, with many leading technology companies — including chipmakers, semiconductor, equipment manufacturers and service providers — having their research and development base in the country,” said Jagdish Mitra, chief strategy officer, Tech Mahindra. “With such a futuristic communication ecosystem and a high-quality workforce that understands technology, it makes good sense to step-up our presence in the region.”L&T Infotech (LTI), a group firm of engineering conglomerate Larsen & Toubro which was set up by two Danish engineers in 1938, looked at this region first when it decided to expand into Europe. “Nordics’ IT & BPO services market size is estimated to be over $25 billion, and has a high outsourcing maturity in the region… Our investment and expansion are further driven by the fact that Nordic countries have been at the forefront of innovation,” said Sudhir Chaturvedi, president-sales, LTI, which also provides services to the region from its nearshore centre in Poland.",WIT,en,The Economic Times India

Tata Sons, briefly led by Ratan Tata during turbulent times after Mistry’s dismissal, needed him out as a result of failed trust. That has since been achieved.Mistry left the group’s leadership over three years ago, and stated in several representations that he did not want to return. Mistry’s fight has been to restore his pride after the ignominious firing in October 2016.The order, which will now be appealed at the Supreme Court, cleared Mistry as being fired wrongfully in no uncertain terms.

The rapid proliferation of digital technologies is redesigning business supply chains, and is poised to transform the way procurement function delivers its value.

USCIS follows the October to September financial year.“The denial rates for H-1B petitions have increased because USCIS has changed the standards for approval without new regulations or Congress passing a new law,” Stuart Anderson, executive director of NFAP, told ET.Denial rates for initial H-1B petitions or fresh applications stood at around 6% in FY 2015.“The denial rate for initial employment, primarily for new employees, has increased for nearly all leading companies but it’s clear USCIS adjudicators have singled out information technology services companies for the most restrictive policies,” Anderson said.Cognizant saw over 60% of its initial applications rejected, followed by Capgemini, Accenture, Wipro and Infosys.In 2018, the top six Indian firms got just 16% or 2,145 H-1B work permits, less than the 2,399 visas that Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, secured for its employees.Apple, Cummins and Walmart are the three companies that have seen no change in the percentage of rejections, according to the analysis of 27 top technology companies by NFAP.Immigration experts say such high rejection rates for work permits could hit talent movement and thereby the tech services companies’ ongoing business.“There is a problem… a sharp increase in denials.","WIT,WMT",en,The Economic Times India

And, because the purpose of PeopleSoft Financials was to operate the entirety of Crawford’s finances, the damages resulting from Cognizant’s failure have been severe,” the lawsuit filed in February with the Georgia Northern District Court said. “The combination of poor coding standards and insufficient testing resulted in multi-million dollar revenue recognition problems and a multi-million dollar effect on the bottom line,” the suit added.Crawford said complaints were made not only by Crawford’s project manager but its chief global information officer and its chief operating officer also escalated the pro-blem. “Crawford had worked with Cognizant for years in good faith to implement PeopleSoft Financials.In 2018, as the second phase of implementation experienced greater problems, with no remedy from Cognizant, Crawford tried to resolve the problems with Cognizant’s work,” the suit said.In October 2018, the company told Cognizant it was transferring the work to another provider.",WIT,en,The Economic Times India
