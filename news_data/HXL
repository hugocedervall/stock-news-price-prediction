Here are the 14 stocks best-positioned to benefit from the boom.","Summary List Placement Investing in space can seem like a million miles away for most investors with the majority of pure play space organizations remaining private. However, over the years the space industry has grown more complex. There are significantly more providers of satellite equipment and services in addition to the expansion into new areas of the space market, such as space tourism. A new research note from Bank of America explains why the space economy is likely to grow by $1 trillion in the next decade. ""In our view, the space economy will likely grow by over $1tn in the next decade alone. While the COVID-19 pandemic has led to delays in some public and private programs (Arianespace, Rocket Labs, ESA), the outbreak has not appeared detrimental to overall investment,"" said Bank of America's equity analyst, Ron Epstein, in the note. The main drivers in growth will be increased spending from the United States Space Force, a branch of the Armed Forces that was established in 2019.",HXL,en,Business Insider
