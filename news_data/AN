In a bizarre - and for now successful - attempt to pump HTZ stock, Jefferies analysts Hamzah Mazari and Bret Jordan wrote this morning that the bankrupt company could sell its roughly 150,000-car inventory and somehow pocket $3 billion in proceeds (roughly $20K per used car) as it looks to stay afloat after filing for bankruptcy. According to the Mazari and Jordan, who probably did not know that one of their roles as a ""research analyst"" would be to moonlight as the world's biggest used car salesmen, ""channel checks"" suggest used-car firms like CarMax and AutoNation could be among the firms looking to purchase used Hertz vehicles amid rise in demand for used cars. The very hypothetical move could, in theory, help ease some pressure for Hertz, as a sale of its used-car fleet would shore up some cash concerns and could fetch about $3 billion, the analysts said. ""Given what appears to be robust demand for inventory in a rapidly recovering used retail market, we see ~150k HTZ cars as an attractive option for retailers such as AN and KMX with strategic focus on expanding used volumes,"" Mazari said. ""The most logical step would be to buy the fleet of cars which are available at a good price and shape … that's where the value lies,"" the Jefferies used car salesman noted, adding that the sale of cars - taking place at rather overinflated values - would help HTZ pay its lenders but also shore up some cash.",AN,en,Zero Hedge
