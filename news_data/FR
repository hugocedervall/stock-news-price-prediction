The test site in County Clare is set to monitor how a number of self-driving vehicles, including the Jagaur I-PACE, fare as they navigate a variety of road environments and traffic scenarios, the carmaker said. Cisco, Red Hat, Renovo, Valeo, and Mergon are also supporting the Future Campus Mobility Ireland (FCMI) project, which will involve retrofitting 12 kilometres of roads with sensors and high-accuracy location systems, according to Jaguar Land Rover. It explained the site will include a dedicated on-site control centre, electric vehicle charge points, autonomous parking, 'smart' junctions, and will link to a 450 kilometre stretch of highway and Shannon Airport's air traffic corridor. ""The smart city zone provides a first-class facility for global companies to work together and develop world-leading technology, from autonomous vehicles to connected infrastructure,"" said Russell Vickers, chief executive of FCMI. ""The testbed provides an opportunity to test in the real world and help answer some of the questions posed by the future of mobility in a collaborative and efficient way.""

Swiss giant Roche Holding AG is following up with its own version.Antibodies are markers of infection, and testing for them helps health officials see how widely the virus has spread. Until now, most tests could tell only whether they’re present. The newer ones go a step further, measuring the quantity of these proteins, which are raised by the immune system to disable viral invaders.The level of the body’s response is important in determining whether patients will develop immunity. It’s also key to determining the effectiveness of vaccines as developers bring promising candidates into late-stage trials.“You need a test that shows whether a vaccine has triggered the right level of antibodies in a patient’s blood,” said Deepak Nath, president of laboratory diagnostics at Healthineers. “It’s important to say how much of it you have.”Vaccine TrialsModerna Inc. used a form of quantitative testing to show that all 45 participants in a phase I trial of its experimental coronavirus vaccine developed antibodies.",FR,en,Economic Times India

The Global Commercial Vehicle & Off-highway Radar market accounted for $94.37 million in 2018 and is expected to reach $723.61 million by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 25.4% during the forecast period. Some of the key factors propelling the market growth are increasing number of autonomous vehicles, rising demand for commercial vehicles, and need for measuring the velocity of vehicles with high accuracy. However, inability of the system to distinguish multiple targets is the restraining factor for the growth of the market. By vehicle type, commercial vehicle segment is expected to grow at a significant market share during the forecast period as it is becoming necessary to tackle speed, distance, and such parameters of the commercial vehicles. On the basis of geography, Asia Pacific is anticipated to hold considerable market share during the forecast period due to the increasing infrastructure projects initiated by governments in the region.",FR,en,Benzinga Feeds
