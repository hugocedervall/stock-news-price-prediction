You can hold virtual meetings with virtual friends using virtual reality systems hosted on virtual servers. And in energy circles, one of the biggest buzzwords in recent years is the virtual power plant, or VPP. The term first started to be bandied about in the 1990s. But VPPs have really taken off in the last 10 years, not just as a concept but as something that a growing number of energy companies are creating, using and commercializing. Here’s the real deal on this virtual energy phenomenon. Explain this ‘VPP’ thing… According to Germany’s Next Kraftwerke, one of the pioneers of modern VPPs, it’s “a network of decentralized, medium-scale power generating units such as wind farms, solar parks and combined heat and power units, as well as flexible power consumers and storage systems.” In practice, a VPP can be made up of multiple units of a single type of asset, such as a battery or a device in a demand response program, or a heterogeneous mix of assets.",CNA,en,Green Technology Media

The partnership, called Calibrant Energy, will initially focus its energy-as-a-service model in the United States, where corporate and industrial customers have become heavyweight renewables buyers as they seek to reach decarbonization goals. Calibrant will offer a range of energy solutions — including solar, storage and microgrids — for C&I customers, as well as the so-called ""MUSH"" market of municipal entities, schools and hospitals. The JV will fund projects with no-money-down terms for customers, and earn money through revenues from long-term power purchase agreements. Siemens will build the projects and handle operations and maintenance, although the venture may work with development partners as well, depending on the project. “We're pretty flexible on the way in which opportunities come to us,” said Chris Archer, Macquarie’s head of green energy in the Americas. “The JV is designed to respond to the different routes in which a project can be originated.” Calibrant brings together Macquarie’s Green Investment Group, the firm’s clean energy investment arm, and Siemens’ Smart Infrastructure and Financial Services groups, both housed under the Siemens AG mothership.",CNA,en,Green Technology Media

Financial terms of the acquisition weren’t disclosed, but Enbala CEO Bud Vos said in a Tuesday interview said that “our investors would call it a very large success.” Enbala’s DER orchestration software platform is orchestrating roughly 600 megawatts of flexible loads like pumps and motors, backup generators and behind-the-meter batteries grid services in the U.S., Canada and Australia, according to Wood Mackenzie data. That software can now be put to use enabling Generac’s existing fleet of thousands of megawatts of residential and industrial standby power generation deployed across the United States, as well as its expanding business selling its PWRCell batteries for standalone or solar-linked home backup.

Located in Cornwall in the southwest of England, the 2.3-megawatt turbine will generate enough electricity for around 1,500 homes each year. But it will also test a solution to an issue that is increasingly affecting the U.K.’s clean energy transition: grid constraint. Cornwall is one of the sunniest and windiest regions of the U.K., and its high levels of renewable energy capacity have resulted in severe grid constraints. It is one of the reasons why no wind turbines have been installed there since 2016 — alongside planning restrictions and removal of government subsidy to the sector. Traditional network reinforcement is an expensive and lengthy process. However, utility Centrica has been leading trials to find more cost-effective solutions to grid constraints, that boost the business case for renewable energy generation and storage at the same time.",CNA,en,Green Technology Media

Speaking at a virtual automotive industry event today, Shapps said it the current generation was driving the transition to zero emission transport, a major transformation which he compared in scale to the invention of the railways and the internal combustion engine in 18 th and 19 th centuries. And, with the Covid-19 crisis shifting behaviours and leading to a major uptake in cycling and walking across UK cities, Shapps said: ""Now is the time for a green transport revolution."" ""Part of the opportunity is to shift opinions - to impress on the country that the green transport revolution which we've been talking about for many years is actually happening now,"" added Shapps. ""Some of the transformational improvements are literally within touching distance.""

Low electricity demand during the COVID-19 lockdown and ever-increasing wind and solar capacities have seen U.K. power prices collapse this year — and curtailment costs soar. A pair of public holidays in May exacerbated the problem, sending power demand even lower. National Grid ESO, the U.K. system operator, expects to spend an additional £500 million to balance the grid over the course of this summer, much of it payments to wind farms to stop generating. In total, National Grid expects to spend £826 million to balance the grid in the period May to August. A host of power companies, including major suppliers Centrica and E.ON, sent an open letter this week calling on National Grid to accelerate the deployment of smart EV charging infrastructure, energy storage and other flexibility services, allowing homeowners to make their own contribution to the energy transition and perhaps share in the profits along the way.",CNA,en,Green Technology (Feed)

Now the plan is to bring the supply arms of the big six energy firms under public ownership. We’re talking here about the retail units of EDF Energy, Centrica (meaning British Gas), Npower, E.ON, ScottishPower and SSE, businesses that supply gas and electricity to about 75% of households in the UK. In other words, it’s a big proposal to be slipped into a single paragraph of an election manifesto. You might have assumed the big six were already on Labour’s nationalisation list, but they weren’t. The original plan for the energy sector, unveiled in May in a 24-page “bringing energy home” document, confined the ambition to the energy networks. They are the companies that own the cables, pipes and pylons that transmit and transport electricity and gas. Continue reading…",CNA,en,The Guardian

But while the layer of digital tech in buildings is advancing all the time, the IoT revolution is taking longer to play out than some expected. “In short, a lot of the promise has not been fulfilled,” says Paul Kuehn, a senior sales director at Centrica Business Solutions. “I don't think it's necessarily a measure of the technology at this point. We've gotten past the hype of having the devices. It's the use of the devices and the competency of the operators to be able to figure out how to solve problems with those devices,” explains Kuehn. By next year, there will be 10 billion IoT devices connected to the cloud globally. In another three years, the number could double to more than 20 billion, according to Gartner Research. Billions of those devices — sensors, intelligent lighting and HVAC systems, control systems — are being deployed in commercial buildings and industrial facilities.",CNA,en,Green Technology

2019-09-02 08:34:00-05:00,How businesses can be responsible with energy in today’s demanding world,"Many companies recognize the importance of sustainability, but not enough are doing something about it, according to a survey from Centric Business Solutions. Being sustainable requires a holistic approach that combines business and energy strategies. Technology has made it easier for businesses to be more sustainable overall. Sustainability is one of the biggest buzzwords today. And some businesses have already started to think about their green credentials. A recent study from Centrica Business Solutions showed that between 2017 and 2019 ""being socially and environmentally responsible"" jumped from sixth to third place in terms of priorities for companies surveyed in Europe and North America. But many more need to develop their plans further to become energy responsible — or risk being left behind. Centrica's study found that only 13% of the companies surveyed were performing well in terms of being a sustainable business – one that balances environmental and economic aspects. The study surveyed more than 1,500 people in Europe and North America who make financial or technical decisions on energy matters for businesses with 100 employees or more. (Read the full report here .) Of course, there is no single answer to the challenge of becoming more responsible with energy.",CNA,en,Business Insider
