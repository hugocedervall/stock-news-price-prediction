Subscribe today to receive industry-changing banking news and analysis to your inbox. As digital channels become a more critical part of the overall banking journey, banks' design teams need to strategize on how best to create user experiences (UX) that resonate with their customers. A strong UX enables banks to deliver a simple, intuitive, and frictionless digital banking experience. A superior UX can also help banks improve customer satisfaction and bring in new customers. Offering a wide range of in-demand mobile banking features, for example, can satisfy existing customers and drive bank selection among new ones — but only if these features are designed and implemented well: JD Power found that customer satisfaction was negatively impacted across both online and mobile channels by the flood of complex and hard to understand features that are common in banking apps today, per an analysis from its 2019 customer satisfaction ratings.",HSBC,en,Business Insider

This year we've seen varying degrees of commitment from big lenders in the UK and across the pond, all of them inadequate and far more complicated than they need to be. Barclays has just announced how it intends to reach 'net-zero' by 2050, after facing serious investor scrutiny at the start of the year. It's created a fancy new 'methodology' called BlueTrack and introduced some inadequate reduction targets, the detail of which is unsurprisingly and conveniently tricky to untangle. But it's still just a methodology. Most importantly, the bank still hasn't made any changes to its policy on the energies it can fund. As the UK is preparing to host the UN Climate Conference in Glasgow at the end of next year, British banks are under more and more pressure to demonstrate they care about climate change.",HSBC,en,BusinessGreen

But there are many other ways industrial and agricultural operations harm the planet. Australian-based environmental project developer GreenCollar decided to tackle one problem by creating a new type of credit to address an environmental issue very close to its country’s heart: the degradation of the Great Barrier Reef. Behind climate change, the biggest threat to the Great Barrier Reef is poor water quality. Agricultural runoff from The Great Barrier Reef Catchments, a rural area covering 163,700 square miles of coastal Queensland that drains directly onto the reef, causes high levels of nitrogen and sediment to seep into the ocean and damage the reef ecosystem. GreenCollar’s new system creates a marketplace for ""reef credits"" aimed at mitigating those practices. Similar to carbon credits, these reef credits are sold by farmers or project developers to organizations and companies looking to offset their environmental footprints.",HSBC,en,GreenBiz

Updraft was founded by financial services executive Aseem Munshi, former head of cards and unsecured lending for HSBC UK. Munshi realised that consumers drift into borrowing more and more every month without noticing - and that consumers will pay over GBP10 billion in fees and interests for overdraft and credit cards this year alone. Updraft builds a 360-degree picture of a user's spending and borrowing and provides interventions in order to lift the consumer back into the black.

An internal HSBC UK report seen by the Guardian shows compliance staff tried to warn Britain’s largest bank more than three years ago that it should make a concerted effort to reunite customers with their cash, and was running a “significant reputational risk” by failing to address the issue. HSBC was too quick to make accounts dormant once reactivated. Accounts were allegedly falling back into dormancy within four weeks without regular use – despite HSBC’s formal policies stating that this period should be 90 days. Over half of dormant funds belonged to customers who had active accounts with HSBC, meaning the bank could more easily contact customers to reunite them with their cash.",HSBC,en,The Guardian

Conventionally, lenders would have to process hundreds of pages of paperwork to make a mortgage decision, making this a tedious and lengthy process that's prone to human error. The latest solution is a specialized version of Google's existing technology, Document AI, that leverages optical character recognition to extract important information from complex documents.",HSBC,en,Business Insider

Over the past three months, dividends have slumped by 49.1 per cent, making it the lowest third quarter total since 2010, when the UK was suffering the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis. “Though by any normal standards a fall of this magnitude is terrible for investors, it is significantly better than the 57.2 per cent drop in the second quarter,” writes Link Group. Banks accounted for almost two fifths of the GBP14.5 billion cuts in the third quarter of 2020, as they remain barred from paying dividends by the Bank of England until 2021. Meanwhile, the oil sector contributed another fifth to the cuts, which Link Group says will be “longer lasting” than the cuts made by banks.","HL,HSBC",en,InstitutionAlassetManager

HSBC also expanded its cloud investments during the outbreak.

New data from London-based equity research firm Ortex Analytics shows almost three-quarters of total short losses in August came from big wagers against just five names: Ocado Group, InterContinental Hotels, International Consolidated Airlines Group, BHP and Pearson. Together, they accounted for a bruising GBP310 million loss out of a total hit of GBP420 million to hedge fund short sellers last month. As UK equities gained ground towards the end of the summer, hedge funds made gains from short positions in just a third of FTSE 100 names - 32 companies out of the total 100 in the index – as negative wagers in all sectors ultimately went awry. Hargreaves Lansdown proved the most profitable target for short sellers, delivering GBP26 million in August, followed by the National Grid (GBP17.6 million), HSBC (GBP16.2 million), and Royal Dutch Shell (GBP15.1 million).","HSBC,HL",en,Hedgeweek

An earlier attempt between January and March to regain control over paper gold markets has backfired on the bullion banks. Unallocated gold account holders with LBMA member banks will shortly discover that that market is trading on vapour. According to the Bank for International Settlements, at the end of last year LBMA gold positions, the vast majority being unallocated, totalled $512bn — the London Mythical Bullion Market is a more appropriate description for the surprise to come. An awful lot of gold bulls are going to be disappointed when their unallocated bullion bank holdings turn to dust in the coming months — perhaps it’s a matter of a few weeks, perhaps only days — and synthetic ETFs will also blow up. The systemic demolition of paper gold and silver markets is a predictable catastrophe in the course of the collapse of fiat money’s purchasing power, for which the evidence is mounting.",HSBC,en,Zero Hedge

Open banking has arrived, and it's transforming the UK's banking landscape — next up could be the world. Regulatory efforts in the UK are transforming retail banking, reshaping incumbents' relationships with customers, and easing entry for fintechs. Regulators across every continent are responding with actions of their own. Underpinning open banking initiatives is the idea that ownership of transactional data belongs to consumers instead of incumbent financial institutions. The implications of this change for established lenders in the UK are significant. For those that act, open banking presents substantial revenue-generating opportunities. But the consequences of inaction are even more severe: Business Insider Intelligence estimates that by 2024, £6.5 billion ($8.4 billion) of UK incumbents' revenues will be under threat of being scooped up by forward-thinking companies like fintechs and neobanks.",HSBC,en,Business Insider

Yes, of course, it could be. Desperate governments will take desperate actions. And as the world economy is now slumping into a hyperinflationary depression, unlimited money printing will cause currencies to collapse, leading to a surge in the gold price measured in worthless paper money. So the first question we must ask is: Why would governments punish prudent savers who have taken protection in gold against the irresponsible mismanagement of the economy and the currency?

The only problem is that VaR calculations look at the past, not future, and when we get a forced global economic shutdown as a result of a viral pandemic which sends the VIX above 80, VaR models tend to… fail. That's what happened with the two largest European banks HSBC and BNP, whose risk limits were brutally and repeatedly violated in March as unprecedented market volatility made a mockery out of the banks' estimates on how much they could lose or gain on their trading desks. According to Bloomberg calcualtions, Europe’s two biggest banks exceeded their value-at-risk, or VaR limits, a measure of risk used to calculate how much capital they need to hold against potential losses, more times in March than over several years during calmer times. In March alone, London-based HSBC’s trading models breached the daily expected profit-and-loss threshold 12 times, while French megabank BNP Paribas, which suffered hundreds of millions in losses on its various equity derivative products as discussed previously, reported nine such violations during the same quarter, close to a third of all such instances reported since 2007.",HSBC,en,Zero Hedge

For the past two years, crypto-media outlets and Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocates have placed heavy emphasis on the need for institutional investors to embrace the cryptocurrency sector. The oft-stated belief was that institutional inflow would lead to mass adoption and an incredible spike in the value of crypto-assets as a whole. Fast forward to the present, and the total cryptocurrency market capitalization has yet to reach the $750 billion all-time high seen in late 2017. The slow recovery of crypto prices raises a few hard to answer questions. If institutional funds have been flowing into cryptocurrencies, why hasn’t there been a significant price increase over the last three years? Either there is an almost infinite sell pressure — which shouldn’t be a barrier considering the total crypto market cap is just $248 billion — or this theory that institutional investment will pump crypto prices does not hold.",HSBC,en,Cointelegraph

They did this by constant intervention into the market, pooling their gold reserves to sell down the market. Conceived and coordinated at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Switzerland by the G10 central bank governors, the dirty work of actual gold market intervention was done by the Pool's agent, the Bank of England gold trading desk in London. The syndicate, known as the London Gold Pool was successful until it wasn’t, with the beginning of the end in early March 1968 as the huge run on gold became a tidal wave with sterling and US dollar weakness. On 10 March 1968, a Sunday, the consortium released a statement claiming that: “the London Gold Pool reaffirm their determination to support the pool at a fixed price of $35 per ounce”.",HSBC,en,Zero Hedge

Earlier this month, Hohn – whose fund gained more than 40 per cent in 2019 - called on Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered to withdraw financing for new fossil fuel projects. “Investing in a company that doesn’t disclose its pollution is like investing in a company that doesn’t disclose its balance sheet,” Hohn wrote last year. “If governments won’t force disclosure, then investors can force it themselves.” The pace of change suggests ESG is no longer simply a “luxury” within the investment management industry, say some market participants.",HSBC,en,Hedgeweek

The authority said it could cut the buffer requirement to zero if needed. The countercyclical capital buffer is part of the Basel III regulatory capital framework and aims to build up additional capital during periods of excessive credit growth. This capital can then be released when the credit cycle turns to absorb losses and enable the banking system to continue lending in the subsequent downturn. The central bank's chief executive Eddie Yue told reporters the move was expected to release HK$500 billion ($64.3 billion) into the market and hoped this would support small and medium-sized firms. He said local markets were functioning smoothly despite a large correction in stocks. The Hang Seng Index was down 4% on the day.

On his board were two attorneys with Dentons, the world's biggest law firm.

One of the main draws of this technology is the belief that cryptocurrency and stablecoins offer a genuine route out of the traditional centralised model of banking that epitomises fiat currency.

Other options, if you can get in, include European cooking at Kitchen Table; a British menu at Lyle’s; hot dogs at Bubbledogs; Persian cuisine at Berenjak; Taiwanese specialties at Xu or Indian cuisine at Trishna and Brigadiers or at Michelin-starred Gymkhana in Mayfair (which is scheduled to reopen in mid-February after a fire).These are among the U.K.’s hottest restaurants and all are part of a group owned by three siblings who were born to an Indian family in North London.

The backing by U.K. Export Finance (UKEF), the national credit agency, is effectively a guarantee on the loans and enabled Solarcentury to borrow more than they could have on the open market. The deal represents UKEF’s first in the solar energy market. The funds will be used for the 300-megawatt Talayuela project and the 200-megawatt Cabrera site, both set to be operational by the end of this year. The fresh funds for Solarcentury’s Spanish portfolio are coming from a €27.7 million loan from NatWest and a €27.1m million line of finance from HSBC UK. Both are larger given the backing from UKEF. Additional financing for Talayuela comes from the European Investment Bank and Deutsche Bank. “Having UKEF’s endorsement provides further credibility for our projects internationally, while demonstrating the U.K. government’s commitment to extending the reach of U.K. solar innovation into new markets,” Neil Perry, CFO at Solarcentury, told GTM. “UKEF’s backing on these projects is a major positive for Solarcentury and the U.K. renewables industry as a whole, as it demonstrates the government’s confidence in supporting renewables deals outside of the U.K., both in Europe and emerging energy markets,” added Perry.",HSBC,en,Green Technology

Early attempts at electronic fund transfers still relied on net settlement systems: Banks aggregated their balances with one another before settling up at the end of each business day. If, for example, Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC ) transferred $10 million to Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC ), and Wells Fargo sent $10 million to HSBC (NYSE: HSBC ), these amounts would be aggregated and the ledger would only reflect the money travelling from Bank of America to HSBC, without any information as to the intermediate step. As the volume of economic activity grew, it became imperative to design a financial messaging protocol that would facilitate the transfer of money or securities in real-time. So financial institutions, central banks and government agencies came together to build real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS) capable of clearing and settling payments between banks on a per-transaction basis.",HSBC,en,Benzinga Feeds

But these individuals (their identities have not been released) were not simply collared out in the street. Instead, police described the four as leaders of Spark Alliance, a mysterious organization that has been one of the main financiers of the protest movement, including by bailing protesters out of jail and helping to defray their legal fees. Police seized HK$70 million ($9 million) in bank deposits and personal insurance products from Spark, claiming that the group broke laws about money laundering. In a response posted to its FB group, Spark blasted the police, accusing them of deliberately trying to cut off one of the most important avenues of financing in the protest movement.

During the opening years of this decade, Goldman organized a series of bond issues for 1MDB - short for 1Malaysia Development Bhd - a sovereign wealth fund that was supposed to finance major public works projects for the people of Malaysia.

Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.Talk to us about this case which you are making, why NBFCs are very critical for the health of rural India?What we found in our research is that rural incomes are quite interlinked with what is going on in NBFCs. The old thinking is rural Indians only do agriculture work, but increasingly, over the last decade or two, the reliance on agriculture has been coming down and rural Indians are going out and doing a lot of other activities, for example construction activity. About 75% of construction is real-estate linked and if you come down to real estate, you will see that they depend a lot on NBFCs for their funding. In fact, in 2018, 100% of incremental credit that real estate developers got were from NBFCs and not from the commercial banks.",HSBC,en,The Economic Times India

On paper, what we have heard on Friday is great, but we should we get realistic now and the realistic approach is that this tax cut will take time before it actually kicks in?Yes, you have got it absolutely right. There are definitely some short-term positives out there but it will take time for us to have a proper growth impact. For example, in the short run, there could be a sentiment boost if companies cut prices for consumers during the festive season leading to some consumption demand. I am afraid at this point we are not going to see investment rise a lot which a lot of people are hoping for and the reason is that demand is still very weak.

To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here . JPMorgan Chase has closed its digital bank, Finn, merely a year after launching it nationwide in June 2018, according to The Wall Street Journal . While Finn was mainly available via app, users could also access JPMorgan Chase's branch services, like visiting tellers. Additionally, Finn didn't charge its users any monthly fees.

It remains our view that while the labour market still has positive momentum the RBA will be able to credibly argue that wages growth should continue to rise and that should be enough to keep them from considering cutting the cash rate. In our view, the RBA would need to believe that the unemployment rate was set to rise materially (most likely to 5.5%) before they would consider cutting the cash rate. Our central case is that the unemployment rate will continue to edge lower in coming quarters. This is also conditioned on our economists' positive view on the global outlook, and particularly China. However, if it turns out that global growth weakens more sharply, or that China has a hard landing, the RBA would clearly have considerable scope to deliver policy stimulus.”",HSBC,en,FXStreet

2019-03-20 01:44:23-05:00,FOMC Preview: What 17 major banks are expecting from March meeting?,"Today, world markets are keenly awaiting the outcome of an all-important FOMC’s March meeting, and as we move towards the decision timings, here are the expectations as forecasted by the economists and researchers of 17 major banks. The consensus amongst most economists and analysts suggest, that the Fed will likely leave its current policy rate unchanged, while the central bank is likely to move the median policy rate forecast for 2019 to just one hike from two previously . In addition, they are expecting that Fed will likely announce an end to its quantitative tightening. ABN AMRO “We expect the FOMC to keep interest rates on hold this Wednesday, and to announce an end to the balance sheet runoff in September, though there is a risk the announcement could slip to a subsequent meeting.” “We expect Chair Powell to strike a somewhat dovish tone in his press conference, noting the continued global economic uncertainty given the lack of a stabilisation in the global industrial sector. However, we also expect him to acknowledge the substantial improvement in domestic financial conditions since late last year, and signs of resilience in domestic demand, such as the rebound in consumer confidence.” “At the same time, while we expect a shift lower in the dots rate hike projections to show just one rate hike in 2019, this might disappoint financial markets, which now price in around 6bp of rate cuts by year end.",HSBC,en,FXStreet

To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here . Citibank has abandoned its plans to launch a crypto, dubbed CitiCoin, according to Gulru Atak, head of the bank’s innovation lab, per CoinDesk. Citi’s announcement comes within a month of JPMorgan launching its own crypto solution, JPM Coin, amid great fanfare. Although CitiCoin was never formally announced, Atak’s predecessor Kenneth Moore said in a 2015 interview with International Business Times the bank had the crypto up and running in its labs. Here’s why Citi is abandoning CitiCoin and what it means for the bank's blockchain efforts: Citi was exploring crypto to streamline cross-border payments, but has decided to focus on improving existing infrastructure. Following its experiments with CitiCoin, the bank decided that a better payoff would be gained by making improvements to existing payment ecosystems like SWIFT, rather than starting fresh, according to Atak.",HSBC,en,Business Insider

While Canadian courts will make the final decision, the case will move forward, in a process that could take months or even years. Meng is wanted in the US on charges of fraud and sanctions violations for her role in deceiving HSBC and other banks into processing transactions for Huawei that were linked to Iran. US prosecutors filed roughly a dozen charges against Meng and Huawei in January, as well as a formal request for her extradition, according to the BBC .

According to HSBC filings, the outsized gains ""driven by volatility in Turkish lira spot"" were more than twice as big as predicted by HSBC’s market risk models, with the bank adding that this profit was the biggest of three exceptions it found when it back-tested its model against actual gains and losses for the year.",HSBC,en,Zero Hedge
