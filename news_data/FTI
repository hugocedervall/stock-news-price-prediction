2020-11-23 13:40:00-05:00,Facebook Plans To Promote COVID Vaccines To Curry Favor With Biden White House,"Facebook Plans To Promote COVID Vaccines To Curry Favor With Biden White House Tyler Durden Mon, 11/23/2020 - 13:40 Facebook has decided on a novel strategy to try and get back in Joe Biden's good graces (and hopefully stave off a heavy-handed antitrust crackdown): brainwash convince its 2 billion users that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, while also promoting content about the Paris Climate Accords, especially arguments about the US rejoining the agreement. Part of the company's strategy, as we've noted before, is to elevate the status of Nick Clegg, a former deputy PM from the UK who already has a close relationship with Biden (who served as VP in the US for part of Clegg's time in the highest echelons of British government). But will this be enough to salve the fury of progressive Democrats who accuse Facebook of failing to safeguard American Democracy by allowing too many conservative voices to flourish on its platform. Progressives have accused Facebook of allowing hate speech and Russian propaganda to flourish, with little in the way of actual evidence (though every once in a while progressive journalists will find a 'white supremacist' group whose Facebook page hasn't yet been taken down).","FTI,FTC",en,Zero Hedge

Despite facing heat from an SEC investigation into whether the company mislead investors about how it makes money off their trades, Robinhood is reportedly soliciting pitches from banks as it plans for an IPO sometime in the first quarter. According to Bloomberg, the company is hoping to go public as soon as Q1 2021. However, the story noted that all this is subject to change. Since the beginning of the year, Robinhood has become about as well known for fostering its army of day traders as it is for the frequent crashes and glitches that have at times locked millions of traders out of their accounts in the middle of a market meltdown, leaving them to helplessly look on as their portfolios imploded. As of last month, the FTC had received far more complaints about Robinhood's creaky platform than those of its more established competitors.","FTI,FTC",en,Zero Hedge

The proposal elaborates upon Chinese Anti-Monopoly law which only recently expanded to cover internet companies in January .

Once seen as scrappy disruptors, fintechs have established themselves as a serious threat. For a majority of Americans, these consumer apps have become a key part of their financial lives. From peer-to-peer transfers to new forms of credit and no-fee bank accounts, fintechs run the gamut of personal-finance products. But the startup revolution hasn't occurred entirely independently. Fintechs still need banks, or at the very least, the data stored inside them. With many of their customers maintaining accounts at traditional financial firms, fintechs need to be able to connect and share information with their much larger peers. That's where companies like Plaid and Envestnet's Yodlee come in. These data aggregators sit in the middle, connecting third-party apps to various banks' systems. But in recent years banks have raised questions about the efficacy of these data aggregators, challenging their security practices or pushing to deny their access altogether .","FTI,FTC",en,Business Insider

2020-10-20 09:07:09-05:00,US Justice Dept slaps Google with biggest antitrust lawsuit in two decades,"WASHINGTON: The US Justice Department and 11 states filed an antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet Inc's Google today for allegedly breaking the law in using its market power to fend off rivals. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Google, whose search engine is so ubiquitous that its name has become a verb, had revenue of US$162 billion (RM672 billion) in 2019, more than the nation of Hungary. Republican Senator Josh Hawley, a vociferous Google critic, accused the company of keeping power through ""illegal means"" and called the lawsuit ""the most important antitrust case in a generation."" The lawsuit promises to be the biggest antitrust case in a generation, comparable to the lawsuit against Microsoft Corp filed in 1998 and the 1974 case against AT&T which led to the breakup of the Bell System. The Microsoft lawsuit was credited with clearing the way for the explosive growth of the internet since the antitrust scrutiny prevented the company from attempting to thwart competitors.","FTI,FTC",en,The Sun Daily

Duncan McCann, a senior researcher at think tank New Economics Foundation (NEF) and father of three under-13s, has brought the claim against YouTube's parent company Google before the UK's High Court on behalf of more than 5 million children. The claim alleges that YouTube has routinely broken the EU's privacy laws , GDPR, by illegally targeting ""addictive"" programming at young children and harvesting their data on the platform for targeted ads. ""Google has been profiting from kids' attention for years and it is time to change that. It is inconceivable that YouTube doesn't know it's services are heavily accessed by children. Google must stop breaking the law,"" said Martha Dark, director at Foxglove, a non-profit tech justice organization supporting the claim. She added: ""This case isn't really about ads, I think the price of YouTube's services is that we're seeing lots of children addicted, influenced, and exploited by Google and it is unlawful to data-mine children under 13 in the UK.""

2020-08-02 05:55:00-05:00,How to stop robocalls and spam calls for good,"Filed under: Lifestyle , Living , Living Why do we get so many robocalls? “The short answer is that they work and they are very inexpensive,” explains Jeff Galak, associate professor of marketing at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business. Eliminating humans dialing phones means that marketers and scammers can reach millions of phones efficiently and cheaply. “And they work for two reasons,” Galak explains. “First, they can separate the diligent consumers from the less diligent (aka suckers). If you pick up a robocall and talk to the automated system, the caller now knows that there is a human on the other end of the phone and can sell that information to others who might try and call with some kind of sales promotion or, far worse, call with a scam of some sort. The second reason is that they are a fast way to get information—and sometimes disinformation—out to many people quickly. This is particularly true for older demographics who tend to rely more on phone calls than other forms of communication like emails, text messages, or social media.” Using a variety of schemes, a robocall operation that averages 10 to 15 million robocalls a day can earn a yearly profit of $200,000, says cybersecurity expert Julia Campbell. “If a robocall operation goes undetected for over a year, its profit can soar into the millions,” she adds.","FTI,FTC",en,AOL

2020-07-28 02:00:22-05:00,How Slack could reshape the entire Big Tech antitrust debate in the U.S.,"The House Judiciary Committee may now wish it had invited Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to join Apple’s Tim Cook, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, and Google’s Sundar Pichai at its upcoming hearing on antitrust . Microsoft, after all, was the defendant in perhaps the biggest antitrust case against a tech company in the last half-century, during the “ browser wars ” of the 1990s and 2000s. And now the company may be set to relive the whole thing after Slack complained to the European Commission about how Microsoft markets its Teams collaboration product. Slack says Microsoft is bundling Teams with its Office subscription suite in order to keep businesses from trying Slack by presenting Teams as a viable, and ostensibly free, alternative (the Office subscription product was formerly known as Office 365 and recently renamed Microsoft 365 ). “Microsoft is reverting to past behavior,” says Slack general counsel David Schellhase in a statement. “It created a weak, copycat product and tied it to their dominant Office product, force-installing it and blocking its removal, a carbon copy of their illegal behavior during the ‘browser wars.'” In the 1990s and 2000s, regulators in the U.S. and Europe punished Microsoft for bundling its Internet Explorer browser with its market-leading Windows operating system in order to freeze out the superior Netscape browser.","FTI,FTC",en,Fast Company

The news sent Apple shares moving even lower in pre-market trade. Of course, this is hardly the only bad news facing the Cupertino-based behemoth. The company's shares took a hit the other day when it decided to close stores in some of the worst-hit US states, sparking fears of a second wave. Plus, news that the European Union's anti-trust regulator was targeting the company over its app store and its apple pay service - two cornerstones of Apple's plan to rely on long-term revenue growth from its services business as long-term sales of handsets are expected to plateau, even as some analysts claim the company could benefit from a massive wave of upgrades as 5G is rolled out in the next generation of phones.","FTI,FTC",en,Zero Hedge

The Fair Trade Commission investigated Apple Korea for requiring SK Telecom, KT Corp, and LG Uplus Corp to pay the cost of television advertisements and warranty service for its iPhones. The investigation found that Apple holds a clear advantage over local mobile carriers and that handing over the cost of advertisements was another means of squeezing the profits of the carriers, according to the report. The law requires that Apple comes up with a correction scheme necessary to restore competition practices or to improve business practices. The commission said it will review detailed corrective measures crafted by Apple Korea and decide whether to approve them. Apple Korea welcomed the commission's decision and issued the following statement. ""We don't believe we have done anything wrong but are happy to put this process behind us so we can focus on doing even more for our customers and communities,"" Apple Korea said in a statement.","FTI,FTC",en,Mac Rumors

Taking on American tech behemoths is Vestager's shtick. It's how she built her reputation as a fierce anti-trust hawk (the DOJ's newly formed anti-trust task force could probably learn a thing or two from her). Not only is going after these American firms politically safe, but the EU's strict data protection laws ( remember GDPR? ) are almost impossible for US tech giants to follow. To be sure, GDPR has nothing to do with Vestager's case, which she has been building since at least last summer. Details of the case were leaked to a pair of WSJ reporters ahead of the official charges being filed, clearly a sign that the leak is a warning shot, not at these companies (who have likely been aware of these investigations for some time), but as an update to the investing public (that's why it's going in the Journal, instead of, say, the FT).","FTI,FTC",en,Zero Hedge

A draft of the order obtained by Business Insider shows Trump is mainly attempting to empower federal regulators to re-interpret and amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to make it more difficult for tech companies to moderate content on their platforms. It would direct the FCC and FTC to change the way Section 230 is interpreted, regulated, and applied, and it would allow for users to complain if they think the companies are acting in a way that goes against their terms of service. Legal and tech policy experts told Business Insider that some sections of the draft executive order are not legal at all and other parts would require government agencies to throw out years of judicial interpretation of Section 230.

Nowhere are the effects of growing market concentration felt more acutely than in the tech sector. It’s become the poster child for monopoly in recent years. Based on estimates, more than 90% of internet searches are conducted via Google, and over 70% of all internet referrals go through entities owned by Alphabet or Facebook. At the same time, Amazon controls more than half of both e-commerce and cloud computing , and there are virtually no mainstream alternatives to Apple’s and Microsoft’s operating systems. There is nothing inherently wrong with monopolies, per se. In fact, they can be the most efficient way for an industry to organize itself, particularly where high capital costs or network effects make competition more trouble than it’s worth . However, monopolies can also wreak havoc on the economy if left unchecked. Whatever happened to “Don’t be evil”?

One notable company scheduled to report its latest quarterly earnings tomorrow is Qualcomm ( QCOM ) . The stake is high for the wireless technology giant, as its stock has been soaring nearly 50% so far this year. Can the company’s latest results live up to expectations? That's a good question. Street's expectations for FQ4 are dampened, as year-over-year earnings are forecast to drop by over 20%, following a similar drop in revenue. The US embargo on QCOM’s Chinese client, Huawei, and the after taste of the now-settled quarrel with Apple haven’t helped matters, either. Furthermore, the company is still being scrutinized by antitrust regulators. Accusations differ slightly from region to region, but the gist of it is that Qualcomm is using its proprietary power to quash competitors.

Concern about Big Tech had already been mounting in statehouses, but Sessions’s face-to-face meeting created its own momentum. During the meeting, Makan Delrahim, the head of the antitrust division at the U.S. Department of Justice, suggested that attorneys general form a group and come back for further planning, according to a person who attended the meeting.
