States are taking the helm at passing D2C genetic testing regulation, while federal lawmakers remain mum—creating a patchworked legal landscape for genetic testing companies to operate in. Privacy laws have yet to be enacted on a federal level, so state lawmakers are stepping in: Florida recently passed legislation prohibiting insurance companies from accessing members' genetic insights, which could impact the type and cost of coverage.

To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here . Consumer interest in DNA testing has exploded, helping to ignite a new ""hybrid"" model of genetic testing that blends elements of traditional laboratories with direct-to-consumer models (DTC) models like 23andMe, according to new research published in JAMA Network. It's tough to quantify what proportion of genetic tests is fulfilled via hybrid models versus traditional and DTC models, but data suggests hybrid labs are eating up a big chunk of genetic testing: A large traditional laboratory recently reported that it's conducted 4 million genetic tests since launching in 1991, while a hybrid laboratory reported it's conducted 1.4 million tests since its founding in 2004. Hybrid DNA labs emerged to bridge the gap left by traditional and DTC genetic tests — which are centric to either the clinician or the consumer, not both.","NVTA,NTRA",en,Business Insider
