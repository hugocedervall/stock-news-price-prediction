But there are companies both large and small trying to solve this problem. Back in 2017, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation tapped on large brands such as Burberry, Gap and H&M to make fashion circular - ensuring that clothes are made from safe and renewable materials, establishing new business models to increase their use and developing systems that would enable more old clothes to be turned into new garments. Outside of this particular coalition of companies, other fashion businesses are attempting to make the industry more circular by using customisable digital technology, eliminating excess production and tracking the life cycle of products. One of those companies is San Francisco-based clothing startup unspun , which produces sustainable jeans via a unique digital process: customers design their ideal pair of jeans, use their smartphones to takes a 3D scan of their bodies, then receive the custom-built denim in the mail. ""We think it's really important to think of this from a closed loop and regenerative system, because humans are so used to going for the 'next thing,'"" said Beth Esponnette, co-founder of unspun, during part one of a discussion about scaling circular fashion during Circularity 20 in late August.

The White House last week announced a phased approach that states can use to reopen businesses like gyms and bars, provided that new coronavirus cases are on a downward trajectory. States including Georgia and Florida have started lifting the strictest measures that froze swaths of their economies. This process of pulling the broader economy out of its worst downturn in nearly a century is likely to be uncertain and uneven, according to Goldman Sachs. The investing implication, the bank added, is there is no one-size-fits-all strategy for investing in companies that will benefit as the economy returns to some form of normal.
