But as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt retail and send more shoppers online, Sharma says, it's more important than ever to make things more convenient for shoppers — especially when they need to make a return. Narvar is a customer experience platform that partners with retailers to facilitate shipping, tracking, and returns. Founded in 2013, Narvar currently partners with more than 800 retailers, including Levi's, Home Depot, Sephora, and Patagonia. It also recently partnered with Simon Property Group to create returns drop-off centers at a select group of malls. Consumers can use the centers to drop off returns for about two dozen participating brands, no packing label required. ""There's a lot of coverage in the industry about omnichannel in terms of shipping or purchases,"" Sharma said, referencing services like buy-online-pickup-in-store or ship-from-store. ""But [there is] not much on returns.""

As a result, when it comes to most prices in the electronics bucket, Amazon has some of the highest online prices now compared to such upstart online competitors as Walmart and Target , which are now in the unenviable position of having to undercut Amazon's prices to win market share. So is it indeed the case that Amazon's prices are now above its competitors? Not necessarily. This morning, Goldman published the takeaways from week 3 of its annual holiday pricing survey in which the bank captured the online prices of selected baskets of goods at WMT, TGT, AMZN, KR, ULTA, M, KSS, WSM, BBBY, JWN, DKS and Sephora as of November 10th.",JWN,en,Zero Hedge

A companhia entende que ainda existe uma restrição de fluxo no varejo físico, como resquício do isolamento social, mas a venda on-line segue com um papel relevante, apesar de o grupo, no total, apurar receita trimestral em queda, com efeito negativo da operação do varejo físico.",JWN,pt,Valor Econômico

Dropshipping is an e-commerce fulfillment method in which the seller doesn't hold any inventory in a warehouse. Instead, the dropshipper acts as a middleman between the supplier and the customer. Because of it's low up-front costs, it's a popular way for burgeoning e-commerce entrepreneurs to launch businesses selling products online. But Mohebpour kept running into the same set of problems. ""The vast majority of dropshippers source products from China — mostly using platforms like AliExpress, and Alibaba,"" Mohebpour told Business Insider in an interview. If you're selling products to customers in the U.S. that can create a series of issues. ""It can take two weeks or up to two months to get a product. The quality of products is not good.

Strong earnings results last week from some of the more closely watched retailers, including JW Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN ), Gap Inc (NYSE: GPS ), and Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE: FL ), certainly helped bring a holiday glow, though Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD ) and Macy’s Inc (NYSE: M ) didn’t do as well. The usual suspects are likely going to be front and center on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, including Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Target (TGT), Apple Inc.

2019-11-14 17:44:00-05:00,The best places to buy women's jeans,"A great pair of jeans is a staple every woman should have in her wardrobe. Our favorite place to buy women's jeans is Everlane because the denim fits well, is affordable, and is made transparently. If there's an equivalent in your closet to, say, butter in your refrigerator, it must be your favorite pair of jeans. Is there a food that butter does not improve? No. Is there an outfit that a good pair of jeans does not make better? Absolutely not. Is butter a necessary part of life? Yes. Do you need jeans to get through society? Surely. You see, the parallels are uncanny. While there exists no shortage of stores from which to purchase your new favorite bottoms, there are a few places that we turn to without fail for a great pair of long-lasting, comfortable, and good-looking jeans. And that's because they satisfy a few key criteria. First and foremost, you'll want your jeans to be incomparably comfortable. After all, I practically live in my favorite pair, and that's only the case because wearing them and wearing leggings are about equal when it comes to mobility and stretchability (though leggings, are not, in fact pants).",JWN,en,Business Insider

To use another cliché, comfort is key here. Otherwise, what's the point? Just wear those heeled booties that everyone pretends are comfortable but actually make your back ache by midday. Your flats should be cozy enough to wear morning and night, cute enough to elevate a basic outfit, but simple enough to go with most of the items in your closet. But for shoes that profess to be comfortable, flats have given me some of the worst foot pain of my life.",JWN,en,Business Insider

Don't forget to buy the stuff you need before you leave on your cruise, because once you're on board, it's too late. Technically, y ou could buy small things like sunscreen on the ship, but they'll be a lot more expensive than if you'd just brought your own. Some of my must-have items would help you feel better at sea ( like motion sickness wristbands ) while others are meant to help save money ( like travel insurance ) or protect against theft ( like a safe you can secure to a chair ). Cruising can be a ton of fun for everyone in your family. It's often easy on the budget and I think it's an efficient way to see new countries you've never visited before. I frequently cruise with my family in Europe and the Caribbean for these reasons alone. In fact, I was able to go on a cruise to see Norwegian fjords with my family for under $7,000 including airfare . But before you head to the port for your first cruise, you'll need to pack strategically to save space, money, and your own sanity.",JWN,en,Business Insider
2019-09-13 10:45:15-05:00,Walmart exec Andy Dunn explains how he and his boss Marc Lore almost made an 'illegal' move on Shopify while struggling to reboot a flailing mattress brand (WMT),"Andy Dunn, Walmart 's senior vice president of digital consumer brands, says it's easy to ""lose sight"" of your core customer in retail. The Bonobos cofounder told the audience at the Business of Home's first Future of Home conference about working with the Walmart e-commerce team to rescue a struggling mattress brand. The Allswell online mattress brand initially flopped because its price point was too high. Dunn said that his boss, Walmart e-commerce CEO Marc Lore, inadvertently recommended an illegal strategy. Instead, the team worked out a more fitting price point for the mattress, with immediate results. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Celebrity hairstylist Laura Polko used these hair rollers to c reate Gigi Hadid's 2018 Met Gala look, so I asked her to walk me through how she did it before attempting to follow the steps. Overall, even with some amateur mistakes made, the rollers gave me incredible body, shine, and curl in 10 minutes. Like the company's $160 Bodywaver Curling Iron , the hot rollers are a good cheat code to getting that blowout look without the hassle. For the last year, T3's Bodywaver Curling Iron has been my cheat code to getting a salon blowout look . That's because I can achieve it without either dropping the $50 per visit or needing the dexterity to wield a round brush and blow dryer simultaneously at home. The Bodywaver's success led me to try the company's Volumizing Hair Rollers — which are slightly cheaper ( $99.99 compared to $160 ) and even faster to use.",JWN,en,Business Insider

2019-09-10 17:00:00-05:00,In defense of expensive denim — why I willingly spend $200 on Rag & Bone jeans,"As I've grown up, I've realized that it's better for my closet and my wallet to invest in certain pieces rather than buy cheap throw-aways. Denim is one such item, as I've noticed that there really is a difference between high-quality and budget denim. I present to you my defense of expensive denim — specifically, the pairs I love from Rag & Bone . I have to admit, I have a vice. But, it's probably not what you think. I don't even feel guilty about how much I love it, much to my wallet's chagrin. Denim — it's one of my favorite things to buy, and of course, wear. Not just any denim will do, though. Over the years, I've dabbled in it all. From sub-$20 pairs at Forever 21 to the kind of splurges that took months of saving up allowance and babysitting money, my shopping adventures have taught me a lot about what to look for in my denim and what is most worth my money. Over the years, I've come to the conclusion that expensive denim is worth it — and I'll tell you why. Why jeans are worthy of an investment There are many reasons you may find it smart to invest in a good pair of jeans for yourself.",JWN,en,Business Insider

2019-09-09 16:30:00-05:00,7 new and classic brands you should consider when shopping for fall boots,"A great pair of fall boots is one thing I splurge on every year, but you don't always need to go beyond your budget to find a pair you love. Below, I've rounded up 7 of the best brands to begin your search with, including Everlane , M.Gemi , and Thursday Boot Co. , among others. The boots in this list range from $160 to $348. If you're on the hunt for more budget-friendly options, I'd start with a department store like Nordstrom , filter by price, and take advantage of seasonal sales. The perfect pair of fall boots exists at the rare intersection of fashion and function. Beyond style, they must also feature comfort, wearability, and long-term value. A great pair of fall boots has been one of my few annual splurges for the last decade. I still own pairs from 2011, and I still wear them.

Whether you're shopping for yourself or looking for the perfect gift for someone else, any Disney or Mickey Mouse lover would swoon over these picks. Last year, celebrations erupted all over the world as Mickey and Minnie Mouse turned 90. Collaborations were popping up left and right , with everyone from luxury watch brands to streetwear sneaker companies dropping Mickey- and Minnie-inspired styles for adults. This has been great and very expensive news for classic Disney fans like myself. I grew up near Disney World, so my love of Mickey runs deep — and after putting together this list, my pockets run shallow.

2019-09-06 10:51:00-05:00,The best places to buy ear cuffs,"Ear cuffs are a great way to accessorize and get a pierced look without an actual piercing. Brands and retailers like Mejuri , Etsy , ASOS , Nordstrom , and The Last Line have tons of ear cuffs at various prices, so it's not hard to find something that fits your style and budget. I don't have pierced ears, but I love the look. For as long as I can remember, I've solved this dilemma by wearing ear cuffs. You know, those fake earrings that typically sit along the cartilage and make people think you're a lot cooler and more hardcore than you actually are. My first ear cuff came from Claire's in the late '90s and was one of the now-ubiquitous climbing styles that will never go out of style (seriously, I just got a new one this year). As ear cuffs have become more popular, styles have also become more varied and prices run the gamut from $5 to more than $600. When shopping for ear cuffs, pay attention to the materials; real metals will be pricier than the fake stuff, but they'll last longer and are often more flexible.",JWN,en,Business Insider

2019-08-05 10:30:00-05:00,The best nail polish you can buy,"Despite what the colors may look like in the bottle, not all nail polishes are the same. Some are made with biotin, keratin, or vitamin E to help keep nails healthy, while others are formulated specifically for longwear. The best nail polish overall is CND Vinylux Long Wear Polish because it's made with vitamin E and jojoba oil to nourish nails and lasts almost seven days without chipping. With salon-quality manicures easily costing more than $50, it makes financial sense to paint your own nails at home. Nail-care brands are becoming increasingly innovative with polish formulas, so DIY manicures can still look professional and maybe even last longer than if you did it at a salon. In my experience, I've learned that using a good base coat is important. Even the best nail polishes don't tend to sit as well without a good base. Similarly, Dave Crisalli, founder and CEO of wellness-focused nail boutique PROSE tells Insider Picks that a ""thorough cleansing and preparation of the nail plate both on top and the underside of the nail will create better adhesion and wearability."" This can help extend the life of your manicure up to two or three more days.",JWN,en,Business Insider

The advent of two highly successful subscription services beginning in 2016 — RTR Update (four items per month, $89) and RTR Unlimited (unlimited rentals of four items at a time, $159) — has shifted the company from helping women shop designer for special occasions to altering the way women shop for their day-to-day wardrobes.",JWN,en,Business Insider

Insider Inc. receives a commission from our affiliate partners when you buy through our links, but our reporting and recommendations are always independent and objective. When it comes to natural makeup, it's hard to know which brands you can actually trust. Many products claim to be natural but contain potentially harmful or irritating synthetic ingredients.

2019-05-12 17:00:00-05:00,The best kids rain boots you can buy,"Finding great footwear for kids is hard enough before you take bad weather into account. Children's rain boots need to be comfy, durable, and tolerable enough for picky little ones to wear. The Hunter First Classic Waterproof Rain Boots are a bit of an investment, but they'll hold up and keep feet dry through torrential downpours. Plus, they're super cute. Rain footwear is tough to nail down for anyone , but when you add the constantly changing feet of toddlers and children to the mix, it becomes nearly impossible. Children tend to be more active — and more prone to purposefully leaping into puddles — than adults, and so kids' rain books need to stand up to a lot, without breaking the bank. By design, kids rain boots are pretty similar to their grown-up counterparts, typically made of rubber and sometimes with additional features like handles for easy on/off. They tend to come in a variety of fun colors and patterns ranging from silly and fun to simple one-color designs. Of course, the challenge when shopping for any kids' clothing items is that toddlers and children grow fast .",JWN,en,Business Insider

Insider Inc. receives a commission from our affiliate partners when you buy through our links, but our reporting and recommendations are always independent and objective. A good body scrub is a necessity if you want soft and smooth skin. The exfoliating treatments work to get rid of dull, dry skin to leave your body looking and feeling smoother. Our top pick is the Herbivore Coco Rose Body Polish because the all-natural scrub hydrates while exfoliating skin. When it comes to body-care products, scrubs are oftentimes overlooked in favor of lotions and body wash. But the exfoliating treatments should be included in your skin-care routines if you want to silky smooth skin. While you can also scrub away dull, dry skin by using loofahs or dry brushes, nothing will leave your skin feeling squeaky-clean quite like a good body scrub. Not only do they exfoliate to reveal smoother and softer skin, but they also help other parts of your skin-care routines become more effective.",JWN,en,Business Insider

Insider Inc. receives a commission from our affiliate partners when you buy through our links, but our reporting and recommendations are always independent and objective. The ritual of exfoliating with a bristled brush against dry skin, commonly called dry brushing, has been around for centuries. Dry brushing leaves skin soft and smooth, but it's also said to improve blood flow (if temporarily) and aid in stimulating lymphatic drainage. We spoke with board-certified dermatologic surgeon and celebrity dermatologist Dr. Engelman to learn about the process and its benefits. Below, you'll find a guide on how to dry brush properly. Dry brushing is getting a lot of traction as a wellness trend, but it's actually been around for centuries. In essence, it's an exfoliating technique that uses a bristled brush to slough off dead skin cells and increase blood flow. It's this increased blood flow that's said to stimulate the lymphatic system, which helps cellular debris to move through and out of the body, but I'll say it outright: Dry brushing is best for exfoliating, and there's not much data out there to support other claims about disappearing cellulite or ""detoxification.""

Insider Inc. receives a commission from our affiliate partners when you buy through our links, but our reporting and recommendations are always independent and objective. Handling one baby is hard enough, but twins double the challenge. A great double stroller is essential to ensure you can stay on the move. Many double strollers can accommodate up to 35 or even 40 pounds per seat, so you may be able to use a single stroller for the entire time your kids use one. The Bugaboo Donkey2 Complete Stroller is our top pick because it's adaptable, heavy-duty, and smooth even when loaded with kids. I don't have twins, but I do have two kids. Going from one child to two was a huge adjustment for me and my wife. It was hard to fathom just how much more work handling a pair of kids would be, and I can hardly imagine the challenge when both kids show up at the same time. Families with twins need to give themselves every possible advantage, making the parenting process as seamless as possible.",JWN,en,Business Insider

It’s now possible to find shoes in various leather-look materials that truly resemble the real thing. This is great news if you’re transitioning away from using any animal products in your wardrobe or even if you’re looking for more affordable alternatives to leather. According to Forbes , most vegan leather goods are “made with polyvinyl chloride or polyurethane,” although, “vegan leathers, synthetic leathers, or leather alternatives include everything from apple peels to lab-grown spider silk .” Real leather shoes have historically been considered more durable, comfortable, and long-lasting than faux alternatives, but that’s starting to change, thanks to a few quality-focused brands.",JWN,en,Business Insider
