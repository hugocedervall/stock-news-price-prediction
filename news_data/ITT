One, it was easy peasy for the government getting the Bill passed, courtesy walkouts and absence of Opposition parties and MPs superficially opposed to the legislation. There was little bipartisan scrutiny of the Bill.Two, BJP’s larger political objective. The party’s strategy left adversaries either on the horns of dilemma, or unsure of which way to slink away when faced with BJP’s atypical concern for Muslim women.In contrast, opposition to the Bill was founded on denial about the genuine grievances against ITT, and also lacked purpose, direction and sincerity.Under the present dispensation, BJP initiates no action unless assured of victory. On subjects crucial to its political charter, the leadership wouldn’t risk bipartisan re-evaluation since it could have resulted in the ‘dilution’ of the proposed law.The behaviour of various parties and lawmakers who ensured that BJP’s minority became majority in the House, showed their inability to counter BJP’s accusation of them being ‘pro-minority’.",ITT,en,The Economic Times India
