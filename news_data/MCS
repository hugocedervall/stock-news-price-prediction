Do you want to save for a purchase or a vacation? Maybe you want to create an emergency fund. Set a target dollar amount and a timeframe to achieve this goal (or multiple goals). If you have any high-interest debt, consider whether extra savings should be allocated toward paying that off before putting those funds into your bank or investment accounts. 2.",MCS,en,Kiplinger Washington Editors

These users will retain their account information, as well as privileges associated with Finn, like no monthly service fees, but will be reissued a new debit card. Finn's core problem was that it wasn't different enough from Chase's other services. The stand-alone digital-only service likely wasn't offering customers much they couldn't get from Chase's existing suite. Finn provided traditional checking features, including free ATMs, debit cards, peer-to-peer (P2P) payments, and personal finance management offerings.",MCS,en,Business Insider
2019-06-03 08:45:09-05:00,JPMorgan Chase is seeing slowing deposit growth (JPM),"This is an excerpt from a story delivered exclusively to Business Insider Intelligence Fintech Briefing subscribers. To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here . JPMorgan Chase, the US' largest bank by assets, has seen deposit growth slow as its customers withdraw their money and instead park it with competing banks that offer higher interest rates, according to a bank executive cited by Reuters. Although customers are withdrawing parts of their deposits in search of higher yields, they continue to keep JPMorgan Chase as their main banking relationship, per the bank's copresident and chief operating officer Gordon Smith. Here's what it means: Fintechs and challengers have been quick to seize on US incumbents' reticence to pay higher interest rates — and it's costing traditional banks customers. The majority of big banks in the US continue to offer anemic interest rates. Over the past five years, there's been a steady increase in Federal Reserve interest rates, currently standing between 2.25% and 2.5%, per Reuters.",MCS,en,Business Insider
2019-05-30 08:39:00-05:00,"Citi passed on the Apple Card over profitability concerns — here's why Goldman wasn't worried (GS, AAPL, C)","This is an excerpt from a story delivered exclusively to Business Insider Intelligence Payments Briefing subscribers. To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here . Citigroup was reportedly in advanced negotiations with Apple to become the issuer of Apple Card — Apple's first-ever proprietary credit card that's slated to launch this summer — but backed out due to concerns over its potential profitability, according to CNBC . Other issuers including Barclays, Synchronous, and JPMorgan Chase also reportedly passed on the deal. Goldman Sachs ultimately became the issuer. Apple Card is a predominately digital card that's spent in Apple Pay — with an associated physical card — and promotes habit formation in the mobile wallet through incentives like tiered rewards and cash back, which can be redeemed daily. Card profitability is going down in general, and Apple Card's most compelling consumer-facing features actually lower its profitability for issuers.Rising rewards expenses ultimately make credit cards less lucrative for issuers: Return on assets (ROAs) from credit cards are at a five-year low for issuers and are expected to reach 3% in 2019, down from nearly 5% in 2015, according to Mercator .",MCS,en,Business Insider

Marcus, Goldman Sachs' digital-only challenger brand, has signed up more than 250,000 customers and taken in more than $8 billion in deposits in the UK, less than eight months after launching in the country, reports Yahoo Finance UK. The bank, which signed up 50,000 customers within the first two weeks of its UK launch, offers a market-beating 1.5% interest rate for its easy access savings account. Here's what it means: Marcus' impressive performance highlights that the biggest threat to incumbents' lunch may not be fintechs. The UK's neobank market is flourishing — but Marcus' whirlwind growth suggests there's still plenty of room for disruption.

To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here . Confirming months of rumors , Apple unveiled Apple Card — its first proprietary card product — at its event on Monday. Customers can apply for the card on their iPhones beginning this summer and, if approved, begin spending anywhere that accepts Apple Pay via a virtual card housed in Apple Wallet within minutes. Apple Card, which will be issued by Goldman Sachs and Mastercard-branded, will also include a companion physical card. Here’s our first take on its impact: The new card and features could give Apple Pay a boost. Apple Pay launched in the US in 2014 and has been adding users , but growth has been coming largely from international launches rather than US-market gains. The new Apple Card product provides features and incentives that we think could increase the utility of Apple Pay and accelerate its momentum in the US market, including a rewards structure that incentivizes using the virtual card over the physical card, as well as favorable terms and money management tools.",MCS,en,Business Insider
