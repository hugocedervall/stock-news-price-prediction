But for midsize company stocks, 2020 was less extreme. “I would put it smack in the middle,” says Parnassus Mid Cap ( PARMX ) comanager Matt Gershuny. Over the past 12 months, the fund, a member of the Kiplinger 25 , the list of our favorite no-load funds, gained 9.5%. That beat 76% of its peers, but lagged the 10.0% gain in the fund’s benchmark, the Russell Midcap index. SEE MORE The Kiplinger Dividend 15: Our Favorite Dividend-Paying Stocks Gershuny and comanager Lori Keith took over at Mid Cap in late 2008, during the financial crisis. The duo have beaten the benchmark since then by investing in growing, well-run midsize firms that pass strenuous environmental, social and governance measures. Mid Cap’s 11.6% annualized return since the pair took over edges the 11.5% av­erage annual gain in the Russell Midcap index. “We keep up in strong markets and do better when markets go down,” says Gershuny. Recently, the fund has gained from strong performances in a handful of industrial stocks, including shipping company FedEx ( FDX ) (up 73% over the past 12 months) and global logistics company Expeditors International ( EXPD ) (up 16%), which helps get goods to market or to customers. “Shipping capabilities are down on commercial flights, and FedEx and Expeditors have picked up the slack,” says Gershuny.",POR,en,Kiplinger Washington Editors

Vermont utility Green Mountain Power not only verified the efficacy of residential batteries for meeting grid needs, it saved its customers millions of dollars with them. Now, that program has been ratified by the state’s Public Utility Commission as a permanent residential storage tariff, which means battery installations, and utility savings, will continue to rise. At a time when forward-thinking companies are excited to erect networks of distributed batteries at some point in the next few years, Green Mountain Power represents something of anomaly. It already has not a couple hundred, but 2,567 utility-controlled Powerwall batteries sitting in customer homes, adding up to around 13 megawatts. “These things are functioning exactly as or better than we hoped,” said Josh Castonguay, vice president and chief innovation officer. “You’ve got an asset that’s improving reliability for the customer, and paying for itself, and providing a financial benefit for all of our customers.” By discharging those batteries during hours when the ISO New England grid faces monthly and annual peak demand, GMP reduces the payments it owes to the grid operator.",POR,en,Green Technology Media

2020-07-02 13:55:00-05:00,Portland General Electric Jumps Into Virtual Power Plant Business,"Portland General Electric, the largest utility in Oregon, is jumping into the cutting-edge business of turning home batteries into grid resources. The company announced this week that it has received approval from regulators to link up 525 homes with solar-storage systems into a controllable fleet, often referred to as a virtual power plant. The five-year pilot will study how to optimize the use of these batteries for the grid, while ensuring the customers get what they want out of participating. The fleet of small batteries will only add up to 4 megawatts. But it could lay the groundwork for expansion under PGE’s ongoing grid modernization plan , which envisions around 200 megawatts of “distributed flexibility” to balance supply and demand. “This is part of our overall efforts to really understand distributed resources on our system,” said Andy Macklin, director of Smart Cities & Grid Products. “We’re looking at a decarbonized future. As we add renewables to our system aggressively, we need a flexible distribution system where customers are excited to bring some of their flexibility to the system to help balance those renewables.” Linking home batteries into a fleet is still a new grid practice.",POR,en,Green Technology (Feed)
