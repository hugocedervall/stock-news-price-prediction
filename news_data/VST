2020-10-07 10:10:00-05:00,Morgan Stanley expects more mega-mergers in the oil industry. Here are the 11 deals the bank says are most likely.,"Summary List Placement Hammered by a collapse in oil prices, the energy industry is entering a new phase focused on returns, which is likely to bring a wave of consolidation, analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note Wednesday. Deals could help US oil companies Exxon and Chevron diversify and build out their clean-energy assets, they said. ""European peers have begun to reposition portfolios away from oil & gas production,"" the analysts said in the note. ""Majors in the US have been slower to adapt despite sharing similar advantages of scale. Focusing on M&A in the power sector, companies with renewable development capabilities could be particularly attractive alternatives to oil & gas."" Today, the energy industry remains fragmented, the analysts said, resulting in a recent spike in deals. Most notably, Chevron acquired Noble Energy in early October through a $5 billion all-stock deal, while shale giants Devon Energy and WPX Energy announced plans to merge in late September.

""We expect that to continue."" The bank says future deals are most likely between companies focused on oil production, and among the largest integrated oil majors and smaller energy producers.",VST,en,Business Insider

2020-07-21 08:00:00-05:00,Enel Reveals Plan to Add 1GW of Batteries to US Renewables Fleet by 2022,"Enel announced a dramatic upscaling of its U.S. energy storage ambitions on Tuesday, saying it will add 1 gigawatts of storage capacity to its renewables fleet by 2022. That's a huge jump from late 2019, when the Italian utilities group and renewables powerhouse pledged to build another 14.1 gigawatts of renewable power capacity globally by 2022 through its Enel Green Power arm, along with 300 megawatts of energy storage from its Enel X unit. While Enel X focuses on smaller, customer-sited batteries to help businesses with demand charges, backup power and other needs, the new 1 gigawatt commitment applies to Enel’s utility-scale renewables development business. And it kicks off in Texas, which has long thwarted energy storage development, but recently has started to heat up. “North America is very much on the forefront of Enel’s plans to roll out storage with its renewable generation fleet,” said Ryan Prescott, Enel Green Power’s head of growth strategy and energy storage development, in an interview Monday.",VST,en,Green Technology Media
2020-07-14 12:28:00-05:00,Say Hello to the New Biggest Battery in the US,"Things are moving fast in the grid battery industry, and nowhere faster than California. That’s where LS Power, a private equity firm that develops grid infrastructure, hooked up the new most powerful battery in the country last month. The Gateway Energy Storage Project turned on an initial tranche of 62.5 megawatts/62.5 megawatt-hours near San Diego on June 9, according to the California Independent System Operator. That beats the previous record holder for most powerful battery in the U.S., held by LS Power’s 40-megawatt Vista project, which opened in San Diego County with little fanfare in July 2018. Another battery has more storage capacity: the 30 megawatt/120 megawatt-hour Escondido system that AES (now Fluence) supplied to utility San Diego Gas & Electric. For a laid-back beach town, San Diego has a clear monopoly on the nation’s biggest batteries so far. That will change soon, though. Power producer Vistra Energy is building the Moss Landing battery in Monterey Bay, California, which involves swapping an old gas powered plant for 400 megawatts/1,600 megawatt-hours of batteries to support the Bay Area grid.",VST,en,Green Technology (Feed)

It’s the second major procurement from a California utility meant to comply with the CPUC’s order for 3.3 gigawatts of carbon-free resources to help meet grid reliability needs that will arise when four natural gas-fired power plants retire next year to reduce their environmental harm to coastal waters.

2020-05-16 06:07:00-05:00,Morgan Stanley just published a comprehensive guide to utility investing — and handpicks 12 energy stocks to buy now,"Electricity demand is projected to fall by 5% this year in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

The bank recommends investing in utility stocks that are low-risk and undervalued or high-risk and ""deeply undervalued."" It lays out four drivers of outperformance including a ""second wave"" of renewable energy that promises to wipe out many of the country's coal plants.

They provide essential products like electricity and gas — which people need even in a downturn — and typically they offer high dividends. But what happens when demand for electricity drops off? In the wake of a pandemic that closed large swaths of the country, US demand for electricity was down as much as 14% in some cities last month. For the year, analysts at Morgan Stanley led by Stephen Byrd expect power demand to be down by about 5% overall.",VST,en,Business Insider

The seven projects, which still need approval from the California Public Utilities Commission, will help meet a fall CPUC order for 3.3 gigawatts of carbon-free resources to help meet the state’s grid reliability needs. Half of that solicitation is due online by August 2021, and SCE must deliver the largest share among the state’s utilities and community choice aggregators (CCAs).
