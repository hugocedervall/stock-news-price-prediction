This past week, some insiders add to their stakes in a retailer, a beauty products maker and a couple of conglomerates. A couple of biopharmaceutical companies saw insiders acquiring some shares as well. Conventional wisdom says that insiders and 10% owners really only buy shares of a company for one reason -- they believe the stock price will rise and they want to profit from it. So insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors, particularly when there is uncertainty in the markets, as there was before and after the elections and as the pandemic worsens. Though buy windows remain closed for some insiders during what is left of the earnings-reporting season, plenty of others continued to purchase shares despite some market volatility and economic uncertainty. Here are some of the most noteworthy insider purchases that were reported in the past week. A Foot Locker, Inc.
