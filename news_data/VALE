Easy come, easy go. Case in point: Dry bulk spot rates were surging throughout June and the first week of July. Today, they’re on a steep slide. “Levels for the big ships are spiraling downward,” brokerage Fearnleys wrote in its weekly report. “Every rally is followed by a correction, something that is currently taking place following one of the strongest rallies in recent memory,” commented Breakwave Advisors, creator of the BreakWave Dry Bulk Shipping ETF .

The solar plant is expected to cover all of the mine’s electric power needs during peak solar generation hours, and 65 percent of its overall electricity consumption. Rio Tinto will start building the plant soon and is looking to complete it next year. “We are investigating additional renewable energy options in the Pilbara, as well as other opportunities to reduce emissions across our entire global portfolio,” said Rio Tinto Iron Ore chief executive Chris Salisbury in a statement.",VALE,en,Green Technology

Toward the end of what has already been a roller-coaster year, Vale has announced yet another revision to its production outlook, one that implies short-term pain but long-term gain for dry bulk. New Vale Guidance On Nov. 11, Vale estimated that its full-year 2019 iron-ore sales would be 307-312 million tons, fourth-quarter 2019 (4Q19) sales would be 83-89 million tons and 1Q20 sales would be 70-75 million tons. On Dec. 12, Vale brought the 1Q19 estimate down to 68-73 million tons, representing a range-midpoint reduction of 2.8%. It cited seasonal weather issues as well as new safety procedures involving the disposal of tailings (waste rock) that will temporarily bring its Brucutu mine to 40% of capacity. The Brucutu mine was the site of a tragic collapse of a tailings dam in January that killed hundreds of local residents and closed the Brucutu mine for much of the first half of last year.",VALE,en,Benzinga Feeds

Capesizes had a great run in the third quarter. Rates rose from $20,000 a day in late June to almost $48,000 a day in early September. But then they came back down to $20,000 a day by early November. Given the breakeven rate of around $13,000 a day, it's still a strong market, but the margin continues to narrow. As of Nov. 21, Clarksons Platou Securities estimated that Capesizes rates were $18,350 per day, down 10% week-on-week and 26% month-on-month. What's nudging rates lower and what will bring them back? Current market conditions were addressed on two quarterly conference calls on Nov. 21, as the largest U.S.-listed Capesize owners – Golden Ocean (NASDAQ: GOGL ) and Star Bulk (NASDAQ: SBLK ) – reported third-quarter results.

Rates are now just over half the levels seen in early September and back to where they were in late June, and iron-ore giant Vale (NYSE: VALE ) has just cut its sales forecast, dealing dry bulk another blow. The most important market for Capesizes — bulkers with capacity of 100,000 deadweight tons (DWT) or more — is the iron-ore trade from Brazil to China. It is both high volume and very long: three times the distance as the Australia-China run. Vale initially estimated it would sell 307 million-322 million tons of iron ore and pellets in full-year 2019. On Oct. 21, Vale reaffirmed that estimate but cautioned that the final tally would likely fall in the lower half of that range. On Nov. 11, it cut the outlook further, to 307 million-312 million tons.

2019-02-18 08:30:11-05:00,Trade Hope Rally Fizzles In Europe After China Soars To Four Month High,"The latest ""trade hope"" rally which sent the Dow Jones up 444 points on Friday, fizzled overnight as stocks in Europe and U.S. futures drifted in thin trading (US exchanges are closed for Presidents’ Day) even after a rally in Asia boosted shares to their highest level since October on delayed catch up to the US. The Stoxx Europe 600 was flat, with the Stoxx 50 little changed on the session, with the Dax declining while peripheral indexes IBEX 35 and FTSE MIB outperformed, as gains in telecommunications companies offset declines in carmakers, after President Donald Trump received a report that may be a preliminary step to raising tariffs on auto imports. The autos index, a bellwether for Europe’s economy, fell 0.65%, also pressured by data showing Chinese car sales fell 16% in January, their seventh straight month of decline, and the biggest one month drop in seven years. Trump has 90 days to decide whether to act upon the recommendations. “The optimism on trade has been strong, but the underlying economic data has been a lot of weaker - so you have some push and pull factors,” said David Vickers, senior portfolio manager at Russell Investments, adding much focus was now on flash PMI data due out this week. “As the bounce-back from the December lows fades…the fundamentals now reassert (themselves),” Vickers added.",VALE,en,Zero Hedge

This helped reverse overnight stock losses, with US equity futures jumping almost 20 points from session lows, just as Europe opened for trade, with the Stoxx 600 rising 0.8% on ""hope."" “Negotiations between both sides have achieved important progress in another step,” president Xi said after the 6th trade talks wrapped up in Beijing, quoted China’s Xinhua News Agency. “Next week, both sides are going to meet in Washington.

2019-02-13 13:35:28-05:00,Why S&P Bulls Should Worry As The Baltic Dry Collapse Nears Worst On Record,"As we noted recently , despite global stock markets soaring, global freight indices have been more-than-seasonally weak so far in 2019 with the Baltic Dry Index in particular crashing. The Baltic Dry Index represents the cost of renting an ocean-going container ship to move goods from, say, Chinese factories to the Port of Los Angeles. The more stuff being made and sold, the higher the demand for such ships, and thus the higher the price to rent one. And vice versa. This is definitely one of the vice versa times. After rising to robust levels in mid-2018 the Baltic Dry Index has since collapsed… This is just shy of the worst start to a year on record (since at least 1984)... As The Wall Street Journal recenjtly noted, Free-Falling Freight Rates Spell Trouble For Shipping Dry bulk shipowners face a long period of uncertainty as spot prices collapse and China shipments shrink. A slowing global economy, coupled with weak demand from China over the Lunar New Year and from Brazil after Vale SA’s iron ore disaster, is dragging shipping rates to near record lows, and few in the industry expect things to improve any time soon.",VALE,en,Zero Hedge
