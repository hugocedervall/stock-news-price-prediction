Then, about two months after we first unveiled Wall Street's worst kept secret, the Financial Times also noticed that Corporate America is finding it hard to kick the share buyback habit, even after the US slipped into its worst recession in decades. Citing Credit Suisse statistics, the FT notes that while total buybacks are indeed expected to drop this year as the downturn caused by coronavirus saps corporate profits, companies in the S&P 500 that have reported second-quarter earnings so far have reduced the number of their outstanding shares by an average of 0.3 per cent from the previous quarter .",DOV,en,Zero Hedge
