According to Moody's Investors Service, the move is credit negative as the bank is increasingly relying on digital channels to source and service its customers. ""The recurring outages also risk hurting the bank's brand perception among a growing and increasingly digitally savvy customer base, and increases the potential that clients switch to other banks, which would lead to a reduction in revenue and low-cost retail funding,"" Moody's said. ""We do not expect the regulators' action to materially affect the bank's existing business and financial profile."" Nevertheless, it pointed out that RBI's action will delay the launch of HDFC Bank's Digital 2.0 initiative, under which the bank aims to consolidate all customers' digital transactions, including payments, savings, investments, shopping, trade, insurance and advisory services, into one platform.

As per provisional numbers available on the NSE, domestic institutional investments were net sellers of Rs 17,226 crore over the last seven trading sessions. In contrast, foreign institutional investments were net buyers of Rs 23,738 crore in the cash markets.

Last month, the Indian equity market witnessed a significant dichotomy as the DIIs logged the highest outflow of funds at $5.9 billion, although net FIIs purchase touched an all-time high for any month ever.

The roll-outs could also benefit an unlikely player in Cummins India Ltd (CIL), the maker of diesel gensets.Cummins management and analysts believe that the 5G networks require generators to sustain base stations and towers which CIL can produce and export in large numbers. The fact that China and Japan do not produce the kind of generators needed to power these towers means CIL has the potential to win large orders, they say.The GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) Association estimates that a 10 KW generator is needed in every base station. The 5G opportunity in Asia Pacific can help CIL report a new peak in exports over FY2022-23, according to analysts.“We estimate the additional 5G opportunity at Rs 200 crore per annum for Cummins India on an annual basis and growing over the next five years,” said Aditya Mongia, analyst, Kotak Securities. “We note that other entities of Cummins in Japan and China do not produce the product at present and hence Cummins India has started benefitting from rollout of 5G network in select countries – China, Malaysia and Philippines.”A sharp recovery in its export business in the September 2020 quarter and a visible pick in power division with robust operating performance has led the stock to jump 20% in the last one month.",HDB,en,Economic Times India

This is a move in the right direction.Both theory and evidence reveal that compared to real sector business units, banks are more vulnerable to contagious shocks, the impact of which is much more pervasive and pernicious. Three new-generation banks — Times Bank, Bank of Punjab and Centurion Bank — which were established during the 1990s, were to be soon deregistered because their losses couldn’t be cushioned by their thin capital base. So, capital, especially equity capital, plays a crucial role of loss absorbency in banks. Capital-based licensing also complements capital-based regulation and supervision (read: Basel 3) by the central bank, which is the order of the day worldwide.While PSBs are being consolidated to provide a chunk of India’s capital requirement, their efforts need to be supplemented by resources from private banks.",HDB,en,Economic Times India

The profit of Reliance is not double that of TCS and HDFC Bank put together, but the market cap is. What do you think?It has been driven by people not knowing how to value a particular stock and that is happening in many technology stocks in the US also. People do not know how to figure out the actual valuation of the Jio platform and that is leading to this sort of valuation change. In fact, over the last 10 years, Reliance has not generated free cash flows in even a single year. When you compare it to companies like TCS or HDFC Bank or any other company which has a high ROE, Reliance’s ROE is in single digits. There is a story that is getting built because valuation is getting ascribed by private investors. The future returns depend on execution. They need to execute and they need to generate cash flows because without cash flows, I do not think the valuations will be sustainable.",HDB,en,Economic Times India

2020-09-02 21:50:54-05:00,Better options than bank fixed deposits,"To be sure, banks have reduced their fixed deposits (FD) rates due to increased inflows and lack of safe lending opportunities. For example, the five-year FD interest rate from SBI is just 6.2 per cent for senior citizens and 5.4 per cent for others. FD rates offered by HDFC Bank are also similar – i.e. 6.25 per cent for senior citizens and 5.5 per cent for others. While this is low for normal investors, this is really unattractive for people in high tax brackets. For example, a pre-tax return of 5.4 per cent will go down to just 3.72 per cent for investors in the 30 per cent tax bracket.While banks went on with slashing FD rates, a reduction of this magnitude did not happen in other products – especially in government sponsored products. There are several options that offer better returns and therefore, investors should consider locking into these at higher rates. Why should you do so? “Although the rate fall has paused now, it is expected to remain at a lower level for the next 1-2 years and therefore, it makes sense to lock in into long-term options that give returns close to 7 per cent,” says Rajiv Bajaj, CMD, Bajaj Capital.Since each of these options will have different time frames and tax implications, let us consider one option at a time:Voluntary Provident Fund (VPF)All employees covered by the Employment Provident Fund (EPF) can also invest an additional amount and that is VPF.",HDB,en,Economic Times India

Is it only about liquidity which is making the markets look good and is liquidity the only reason why markets are trading where they are?For any market, liquidity is very important, there is no doubt about that. My view is liquidity cannot be the only reason. The markets are also responding to the fact that there is a gradual recovery and opening up of the economy. India is not the only country where the markets have gone up. So in many senses, it is a global phenomena and we must not forget that Indian markets were recovering even while FIIs were selling in this market.

They have made good provisions for potential Covid losses as well. So the overall loan book and capital adequacy ratio continue to be pretty strong.

2020-07-23 12:32:39-05:00,"A strong rupee says more about the dollar, less about our economy","By Abheek BaruaIt is natural to be intrigued by the rock-solid stability of the rupee. After all, India is struggling with Covid-19. Intermittent and localised lockdowns have returned, bringing in their wake a flurry of downward revision in growth forecasts.While the consensus among economists earlier was that India would contract by around 5% in 2020-21, this appears to be moving to a ballpark of 7-9%. So, going by the somewhat popular notion that the exchange rate is a measure of the health of the economy, why should the rupee be so strong?The simple answer is that this notion is flawed and the strength of the rupee is, in fact, a reflection of some of its current woes. Take the trade surplus of $790 million in June, the first such surplus in 18 years. This was not driven by roaring exports, but by a sharp 48% contraction in imports. For an import-intensive economy like India, a decline of this magnitude can happen only if the underlying economy has collapsed.Short-Lived AppreciationHowever, a trade surplus also means that we are getting more dollars into the economy from the limited amount we are exporting than the dollar amount we are sending outside to purchase imports.",HDB,en,Economic Times India

So if we look at the banks which have come out with their numbers so far, HDFC Bank came out with its numbers wherein it disclosed morat book of only 9%. So that was positively taken by the Street. Now again, Axis Bank has also revealed 9.5-10% morat book number. So again, that is a positive for banking as a space overall. But till now, there is confusion about how different banks are reporting the morat numbers. So there is no consistency in that. Again, if we look at Federal Bank wherein they disclosed morat book of 24%, how they calculated the morat-2 number was; for people who paid the entire amount of money, they removed those from the morat-2 book but in the case of other banks like Axis Bank, that is not the case.",HDB,en,Economic Times India

2020-06-25 13:31:01-05:00,Can India really take China's place as the next factory to the world?,"By Abheek BaruaIndia’s de facto industrial policy wants to chase three objectives — self-reliance, the need to grab a larger share of the global value chain (GVC), and a reduction in the economy’s dependence on China. To be successful, it must take into account the altered global economic landscape that is likely to emerge in the post-Covid-19 era. It also needs to ponder over the many advantages of incumbency that China enjoys having been the ‘mother factory’ of the world for almost three decades. Take the aspirations of gaining a bigger foothold in the global supply chain (GSC) if manufacturers, particularly in the west, diversify away from China to de-risk production from ‘shocks’ like Covid-19. So, if they indeed want to cut risk, where do they go? Supply chain expert Willy Shih of Harvard Business School makes a compelling case for ‘localisation’ in a March 2020 article (bit.ly/3dwPxWK) — that is, having suppliers physically close to the parent factory. Cluster No Bluster If Shih is right, this would mean that a carmaker in the US may want all its vendors located in the US, even perhaps in the same state.",HDB,en,Economic Times India
2020-06-25 05:55:43.108000-05:00,ICICI Bank's $3 bn capital raised to target growth,"New Delhi: A potential capital raise of $3 billion by ICICI Bank could be tofurther improve its margin of safety and to be better prepared to capitalize on potential growth opportunities. According to a research report by Morgan Stanley, ICICI Bank may look to raise capital for two reasons. To further improve its margin of safety, HDFC Bank and Kotak have much higher capital ratios and to be better prepared to capitalize on potential growth opportunities as the economy stabilizes amid weak competition. During its F4Q20 results conference call, the bank had mentioned that while its capital position is comfortable (CET 1 ratio at 13.4 per cent), it would look for opportunities to strengthen its balance sheet further. Against this backdrop, the bank has already reduced its stake in the two insurance subsidiaries (ICICI Prudential Life and ICICI Lombard), boosting capital ratios by 40bps. ""In our view, the bank doesn't need to raise capital for potential NPLs,"" Morgan Stanley said. ICICI Bank is well placed among Indian banks and it could absorb up to 12 per cent of loans as potential NPLs, based on current excess capital/coverage. ""This is 2X what we estimate would arise in a high stress scenario,"" it said. ""In our base case, we are currently building in 3% annual slippages over F21-22 and credit costs at 245 bps and 120 bps, respectively, keeping NPL coverage high at 72 per cent as of end-F22.",HDB,en,Sify.com

The restricted tenure will ensure “separation of ownership from management but also reinforce a culture of professional management,” the paper said.Once implemented, the rules would pose one of the biggest issues for Kotak, who has headed Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. since he founded the lender in 2003.“Kotak Bank might be affected more as Mr. Kotak has completed 17 years as CEO,” analysts at Jefferies wrote in a note. The proposals could mean Kotak will have to step down in 2022 or 2023, depending on when the rules are implemented, the analysts said.Earlier this year, Kotak settled an unprecedented court battle with the RBI over the level of his holding in Kotak Mahindra Bank.",HDB,en,Economic Times India

The RBI's latest discussion paper evaluates the merits of term limits for senior management - Whole Time Directors (WTDs) and CEOs. The paper limits term to 10 years in office for WTDs and CEOs from the promoter group and 15 years for non-promoter groups. ""This will not only help in achieving the separation of ownership from management but also reinforce a culture of professional management,"" the RBI said in the paper. The new policy could also be a clean-up exercise to invoke strict management practices in the aftermath of the fiasco at Yes Bank. Although the RBI refused Rana Kapoor's re-extension as CEO in 2019, he had already served as CEO for 15 years before passing the baton to Ravneet Gill.

I think so. What Moody’s did was quite expected considering that they believe the debt to GDP of India will go from 72% to 84% over a period of time. The measures which the government announced against Covid and the actual cash flow to the economy will probably be 1% of the GDP rather than the 10% that the government talked about.

But as with countries battling Covid-19 with similar containment strategies, this has come at a cost.A‘revival’ strategy consists of different components: direct expenses to fight the virus itself; ‘relief ’ for those whose lives and livelihoods have been severely impacted; ‘stimulus’ for getting businesses back on their feet.A common misconception is that resources allocated for revival have been insubstantial. This argument assumes that stimulus must necessarily be fiscal in nature. However, economic revival is also contingent on the aggregate flow of funds to the economy. RBI’s targeted long-term repo operations (TLTROs) aimed at enhancing investment in corporate bonds and commercial paper amounting to Rs 1.5 lakh crore must be taken into account. So, an accurate measure of the total amount already allocated for economic revival — the relief package, plus targeted liquidity facilities — adds up to Rs 3.2 lakh crore, or 1.5% of GDP.",HDB,en,Economic Times India

In a call with analysts, the bank management said that if required, it would utilise the existing buffer provisions built over the last few years.“HDFC Bank is better positioned to weather the storm; however, in times of economic dislocation, it is sensible to remain conservative assessing the multiplier adverse effect of Covid-19,” said Sandeep Joshi, banking analyst, ICICI Securities. “We anticipate the bank’s loan growth will moderate to 12%, net interest margins contract by 9 basis points due to focus on quality (assets), and credit cost to be elevated at 1.7% in FY21.”75241239The Mumbai-based bank reported a healthy profit after tax growth of nearly 18% at the end of the March quarter, although the growth in profit declined sequentially by 7%.",HDB,en,Economic Times India

If they now respond by curtailing new loans even to healthy borrowers, that will have serious consequences for the Indian economy and the pace at which it can emerge from the crisis.“We expect a sharp slowdown in credit growth and deterioration of asset quality across all private banks,” said Saswata Guha, the head of financial institutions at Fitch Ratings in India.",HDB,en,Economic Times India

No ATM is running dry for want of cash,” said a banker.75116477More currency with banks is part of a strategy worked out by the finance ministry and RBI when the lockdown began almost three weeks ago and was meant to avoid any panic in the system as ATMs running out of cash post-demonetisation in 2016 was fresh in the minds of people.As a result, RBI has given more cash to banks, while the finance ministry did a bank-wise calculation and the home ministry chipped in to ensure that there was no problem in cash delivery. “We have received tremendous support from the government, which has helped us make more trips and ensure that ATMs don’t run dry,” said Rituraj Sinha, managing director of SIS.What has also necessitated this is the large amount of cash being released in the system via doles for women Jan Dhan account holders as well as farmers, seniors, widows and the handicapped.",HDB,en,Economic Times India

Fitch Ratings Inc. expects that India will grow only 2% in the current financial year. That would be the lowest rate in decades, a level not seen since this country was closed-off socialist backwater.But everyone knows that fighting a pandemic is costly. What’s even more worrying is how the costs of a slowdown—the sudden pressure on incomes and demand, in particular—will widen pre-existing cracks in the Indian growth story.The weakest link in the Indian economy is its banking sector. This has been the case for some time: The banks’ books have still not recovered from over-exuberant lending to industry back in the boom years. Weighed down by all the bad debt they took on, they have been reluctant to lend to new projects since then. That’s part of the reason that private investment in India slowed to a crawl last year and dragged growth down with it.But, through this difficult period, Indian banks—and indeed, the economy more generally—could rely on strong household demand.",HDB,en,Economic Times India

As US central banker Thomas Barkin put it, ‘Central banks can’t come up with vaccines.’ The US Fed’s attempts to calm the financial markets through an emergency policy rate cut of a hefty half a percentage point on March 3 has boomeranged. Financial markets across the world have read this as a signal that the world’s most powerful central bank is itself panicking.There are a couple of things that economists agree on, though. First, this is both a demand and a supply shock. While the lockdown of production systems across economies will dent incomes, it will also mean shortage of critical goods and services, and, hence, inflation. The path that policymakers need to tread will depend on which of these factors are dominant. The current wisdom is that fiscal and monetary policy have to focus on crumbling demand.Going forward, the supply and price effects need to be kept in mind.",HDB,en,The Economic Times India

The government expects recycling of metals like steel, copper and aluminium from the scrapped vehicles to help reduce their imports. Getting the roads rid of old vehicles would also help lower pollution and the government’s oil bill, as the new vehicles replacing the old ones would be more fuel efficient.The automobile industry wants the policy to cover all segments, including cars and two-wheelers and not just commercial vehicles, to create a significant scale for new players to participate in this new market.74251245 Three critical things the government needs to do to promote scrappage are: offer sizeable financial incentives, develop a resale market for the scrappage certificate for those who don’t want to replace their scrapped vehicles with new, and fix the life period for a commercial vehicle at 10 years, said Satyakam Arya, the managing director of Daimler India Commercial Vehicles.An HDFC Bank study has estimated the market for vehicle scrappage and recycling at $6 billion.",HDB,en,The Economic Times India

To meet indirect tax targets, goods and services tax (GST) collections have to clock Rs 1.1 trillion monthly in the last quarter (January-March) — a number that has been achieved only once this year.Add to this, a dismal advance estimate of GDP for the full year at 5% in real terms and 7.5% (apparently a 42-year low) in nominal (money value) terms, and the stage seems set for a large overrun in the fiscal deficit (FD) from the budget target of 3.3% of GDP.There seems to be consensus around the fact that the best that GoI can do is to limit FD to 3.8% using up the 0.5% buffer that the Committee to Review Fiscal Discipline rules has recommended. However, despite this barrage of bad data, it is possible that the FD could end up being no higher than 3.6% of GDP and perhaps even closer to the target.To understand how this is possible, let’s do a quick summary of the fiscal math.",HDB,en,The Economic Times India

Since neither is likely to relent, it would be in the Supreme Court’s hands to nudge both in that direction, because a mutual agreement is a more lasting resolution than a judicial verdict.After the most recent appellate court ruling to reinstate Mistry, both parties have already met their original objectives. Tata Sons, briefly led by Ratan Tata during turbulent times after Mistry’s dismissal, needed him out as a result of failed trust. That has since been achieved.Mistry left the group’s leadership over three years ago, and stated in several representations that he did not want to return. Mistry’s fight has been to restore his pride after the ignominious firing in October 2016.The order, which will now be appealed at the Supreme Court, cleared Mistry as being fired wrongfully in no uncertain terms. So, he stands vindicated.What no court can do is sit in judgment of the business implications of any decisions taken by incumbent leaders.",HDB,en,The Economic Times India

The fact that investors are holding back because they have spare capacity is an empty tautology. What we need to figure out is why this capacity is spare.It’s best to get a couple of things out of the way at this stage. The claim that demand is somehow ‘saturated’ for a number of products is misleading. Take cars and trucks, the segment worst hit by the current slowdown. A cross-country analysis of vehicle ownership done by HDFC Bank shows that even at its current per-capita income levels, India’s vehicle ownership falls below the curve.So, even if India’s growth were to slow to zero, vehicle ownership should, at least in theory, increase. To put this in context, Brazil and China are over-penetrated.

Hence, it is the airline that is liable for payment and not MMT, they told the court. HDFC Bank’s lawyers, in the subsequent hearings, argued that the bank has deducted money out of a separate merchant account and has done it in accordance with a “merchant agreement” it has signed with its merchant, MMT, and that the bank is very much 'within rights' to do so as per the agreement.In an interim order on September 26, the High Court has asked HDFC Bank to keep the money it deducts from MMT in a “separate suspense account” and not to remit it back to the customers till the next date of hearing in January. “The matter is in court of law and is sub judice,” said Ateev Mathur, a lawyer representing HDFC Bank. “The bank is taking steps to file its reply before the court to challenge the claim, which the bank will do in accordance with law.”A spokesperson for MMT declined to comment saying the matter is sub judice.",HDB,en,The Economic Times India

As a banker friend in Mumbai put it to me only half-jokingly, a unit of ""grabbed"" cash collateral in hand is worth more than two units of hypothetical receivables.Yet this is no laughing matter. Not only is opportunistic behaviour going to worsen India’s $200 billion-plus bad loan crisis, but now that everyone from the government’s sleuths to the courts are joining the melee, the ensuing chaos will limit the recovery for lenders and threaten depositors. Rajnish Kumar, chairman of State Bank of India, sat down for a chat with me at the Bloomberg Equality Summit in Mumbai this week. He had highlighted the problem last month by blaming what he called the selfishness of one bank for a default by Altico Capital India Ltd., a nonbank lender to property builders. When asked why his HDFC Bank Ltd. had choked Altico by helping itself to the money the shadow financier had raised elsewhere and parked with him, Aditya Puri, the managing director of India’s most valuable lender, replied: “What is out-of- turn?",HDB,en,The Economic Times India

The company’s market value has surged by $21 billion over the past year, more than any other bank worldwide. Among the 25 biggest lenders globally, no other stock commands a higher price relative to earnings or net assets.Bulls say they have good reasons to be optimistic: HDFC Bank will grab market share from embattled shadow lenders and benefit from a flight to quality by investors who’ve grown wary of smaller competitors.

An 88% slump in the flow of funds to the commercial sector between April and September shows that the producers’ unease is justified. However, one credit tap is starting to gurgle, giving some cause for optimism. Pocket-sized loans are feeding online consumption, with demand coming from smaller cities and towns.

A closer scrutiny of recent monetary history offers better clues to the growth puzzle than hypotheses like demand saturation or changing consumption habits of millennials. Also, the tenure of the new RBI governor that started in January this year has seen a shift away from some of the policy practices that had evolved since 2011. A revised policy framework should help formalise this eminently sensible shift.But why monetary policy? For one thing, much of the economy’s current woes stem from the ‘nominal effect’ — the fact that growth in the current money values of stuff like GDP growth or consumption expenditure petered out. Thus, the fact that the current money value of GDP growth slowed down to just 8% for Q12019-20 (the lowest growth since 2002-03, if different GDP series are blended) is, perhaps, a little more alarming than the slowdown in real growth to 5%.Crudely put, nominal or GDP growth at current prices is the sum of real growth and price increase or inflation.",HDB,en,The Economic Times India

Two separate incidents — both featuring the lender Yes Bank Ltd. — recently underscored the drag of past underwriting follies as well as the lift from a digital reset. It will take time, but good things will come to Indian banking as a result of the present crisis.Start with the sudden default by financier Altico Capital India Ltd. on a 199.7-million-rupee ($2.8-million) interest payment to Abu Dhabi-based Mashreqbank PSC. Clearwater Capital Partners-backed Altico, which borrows money from banks and mutual funds to make loans to property developers, called the situation a “liquidity crisis.” And that made Yes Bank investors gloomy.Based on January data, the midsize Indian bank had a 4.5-billion-rupee exposure to Altico, the third-highest after Mashreq and HDFC Bank Ltd. While HDFC Bank, the country’s most valuable lender, has the capital — and current profit — to take the occasional credit hit, Yes’s capital cushion is already frayed by dodgy loans to beleaguered shadow banks and troubled tycoons.",HDB,en,The Economic Times India

Care, another ratings agency, downgraded the finance company’s debt to below investment grade. Meanwhile, mutual funds such as UTI and Reliance Nippon AMC rushed to ring fence the value of their debt schemes by segregating, or ‘sidepocketing’, Altico’s securities.“The revision takes into account Altico’s significant exposure to real estate sector which is witnessing a slowdown and experiencing heightened refinancing risk which is reflected to an extent with moderation in asset quality of the company,” Care said in a statement.Shares of banks and nonbanking finance companies (NBFCs) ended mixed on Friday as some investors fretted about a possible repeat of last year’s scare and subsequent market meltdown caused by the default and eventual bankruptcy of IL&FS.The default in the last week of September 2018 had triggered a market crisis and brief credit shutdown to over-leveraged finance firms and their clients.Many NBFCs are yet to recover from the 2018 crisis, and investors are still nervous about the poor liquidity condition of many small players.",HDB,en,The Economic Times India

It developed the cash-on-delivery model and made its own billion-dollar logistics unit in an economy rife with a fractured logistics system.

All this while, another potentially mammoth business was sprouting under its shadows.The foundation of this business came from Flyte, the digital music and content business Flipkart tried to build in 2012. But the online music store couldn’t beat the odds. Neither e-wallets nor paying for music were widespread in India then. A bunch of other reasons also led to the venture closing within a year. But the lack of a smooth online payment process had planted the seeds of a potential money-spinner: a payments platform.The brains behind Flyte, Sameer Nigam and Rahul Chari, used the learnings from their failed venture to exit Flipkart and set up PhonePe in 2015, hoping to ride the coat-tails of India’s exploding digital payments ecosystem.",HDB,en,The Economic Times India

India’s GDP had expanded 8% in the first quarter of 2018-19.“We estimate a sequentially lower GDP primarily on account of further deceleration across the board. While a slowing consumption is getting reflected in highfrequency indicators, investments may have paused before the elections — in a wait and watch mode,” said Shubhada Rao, chief economist at Yes Bank.The moderation in GDP expansion is in line with industrial production growing at 3.6% in the first quarter compared with 5.1% a year earlier. High-frequency indicators such as automobile sales, rail freight, domestic air traffic and imports (nonoil, non-gold, non-silver and nonprecious and semi-precious stones) indicate a slowdown in consumption, especially private consumption, even with low inflation. 70811123 India’s passenger vehicle industry suffered its worst performance in 19 years in July with a 31% drop in sales and the ninth consecutive month of declining sales, underscoring a sharp decline in demand.HDFC Bank expects growth at 5.2% in the first quarter and at 6.7% for the full year.",HDB,en,The Economic Times India

2019-08-09 13:08:21-05:00,3 things India can do to beat the economic slowdown blues,"By Abheek BaruaFor the last quarter of 2018-19, India’s GDP grew at 5.8%, well below the 7% average that it has clocked over the last few years. Estimates based on the proxies that forecasters use, like car sales or corporate profits, suggest that the first couple of quarters of the current fiscal year are unlikely to show a dramatic recovery. A more alarming prognosis is that this slowdown is structural. This could mean growth rates of around 6% is the new normal. Persistent sluggishness in activity over a few quarters does not de facto make a slowdown ‘structural’. One has to carefully identify a shift in some aspect of the economic environment that is likely to endure in the long term. A marked change in consumer behaviour — say, a rising propensity to save more and consume less — is an example. Speedbreaker Ahead Besides, it is somewhat pointless to try and fit an economic slowdown into neat boxes labelled ‘cyclical’ or ‘structural’.

For example, we all thought the divergence in broader markets had bottomed out in September to December last year. But we have broken those levels and on the smallcaps also we have gone wrong. This is the maximum divergence we have seen on the broader markets to the index. Finally, that is catching up with the benchmark index starting to break levels. We have gone down considerably in the last 20-25 days and we are back to demonetisation levels in terms of oversold zones and last year in August when Nifty was 10,000. You have done some studies of previous bear markets on how corrections happen and then recovery starts setting in.",HDB,en,The Economic Times India

Analysts said that the benchmarks witnessed heavy selling pressure amid persistent foreign fund outflows, negative global cues, mixed corporate earnings, slowdown in domestic consumption and uncertainty in Jammu and Kashmir. Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday moved a bill in the Upper House to reconstitute the state of Jammu & Kashmir. Shah proposed the revocation of most sections of Article 370 which provides special status to the state of Jammu & Kashmir. Also, China’s yuan tumbled more than 1 per cent on Monday to hit an 11-year low amid mounting fears of an escalation in the US-China trade war, which sparked a selloff in other currencies in the region, Reuters reported. Rupee cracked 98 paise against US dollar to hit a low of 70.58 as concerns over US-China trade war sent Chinese yuan below 7 a dollar level.",HDB,en,The Economic Times India

Once that starts reflecting on the ground, I am hopeful that private sector investments will follow.”The new project pipeline is satisfactory but mostly confined to a few segments such oil and gas as well as renewable energy and road projects that are backed by the government, the banker said.India Inc has been looking to the government for a stimulus programme and help from the monetary authorities in the form of lower interest costs to overcome the slowdown that has led to growth falling to a five-year low.Faced with a record slump in sales, automobile companies are cutting output and others are slashing costs, dampening consumer demand, which has been driving growth for the best part of the past decade.“I believe the government may now be in a position to step up funding for the infrastructure sector as well as the tax sops and other measures taken to promote affordable housing should help the construction sector,” Kumar said. “I am hoping that as the festive season starts, there should be a pickup in demand in the auto sector.”‘Stricter Norms the New Normal’Kumar joins other CEOs such as HDFC Bank’s Aditya Puri who have cited the slowdown in economic growth.",HDB,en,The Economic Times India

The moves by lenders including ICICI Bank and Axis Bank come amid easing liquidity conditions and also within days of a rate cut by the Reserve Bank earlier this month.The RBI is betting on rate cuts, and a subsequent pass-on of the same by the banks to borrowers, as one of the ways to prop-up the sagging economic growth.ICICI Bank is understood to have cut its fixed deposit rates by 0.10-0.25 per cent starting from Monday, officials said.Under the revised rates for domestic deposits under Rs 2 crore, ICICI Bank will be paying 6.75 per cent for a deposit of 290 days to under a year, and 7.30 per cent for a deposit of over two years to under three years, according to the rates on the bank's website.Its smaller rival Axis Bank has cut its deposit rates by up to 0.15 per cent in select buckets, a bank spokesperson said.",HDB,en,The Economic Times India
2019-06-16 22:06:09-05:00,Private banks beat state-run peers in deposit rate race,"MUMBAI: Private sector banks are offering higher rates on deposits compared with their public sector peers that traditionally have a higher share of domestic savings. The weighted average deposit rate for private lenders is 51 basis points higher than stateowned lenders with the differential hitting a six-year high.This implies that the competition to garner deposits is likely to heat up further for state-run banks, which may be sluggish in passing on rate-cut benefits.On a system wide basis, the weighted average term deposit rates for private banks was 7.2% versus 6.72% for government owned banks as of April this year, data compiled by Motilal Oswal Securities showed.The spread or differential is at an all-time high since March 2013, according to data disclosed by the Reserve Bank of India.“Private banks are quick to tap credit demand while deposit growth remains modest, which is making it difficult for them to cut deposit rates,” said Nitin Aggarwal, banking analyst at Motilal Oswal Securities. “All banks are cautious to maintain their net interest margin as they now look for growth after battling bad loans for long.”“The inability to lower funding cost is making it difficult for lenders to reduce interest rates even as RBI has cut repo rate by 75 bps since December last year,” he said.",HDB,en,The Economic Times India

2019-05-06 12:28:50-05:00,Why it's better for India to have bigger but fewer banks,"By Hasmukh AdhiaThe recent successful merger of two public sector banks (PSBs), Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank, with Bank of Baroda has paved the way for the future road map of PSB restructuring. It has created the right synergy, achieved scale and resulted in better shareholder value creation. It would be wrong to think that this move of GoI was in response to the difficult conditions that many PSBs find themselves in. Nor was it meant to provide protection to a ‘weak’ bank like Dena Bank (as it is perceived to be). This amalgamation is the result of a deliberated choice in the present world economy.It is incongruous for the world’s sixth-largest economy by GDP in 2018 to not have a bank ranked in the world’s top 25 by size; China has six. The UK, whom we will overtake to become the fifth-largest economy this year, has three. Canada, the 10thlargest economy, has two, and Spain ranked 13th has one. In the world’s top-ranked 100 banks by assets, India has one: SBI, which is ranked 60th. Clearly, size matters.To be globally competitive, we have to build banks that are bigger and stronger than what we have at this time.",HDB,en,The Economic Times India

2019-03-24 21:46:32-05:00,Lot more appetite for India at an active level: Raamdeo Agrawal,"Raamdeo Agrawal, joint managing director at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, believes the market has factored in BJP 68533100 68523319 68517245 securing 230-235 seats in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. In an interview to Nishanth Vasudevan and Sanam Mirchandani ahead of the Motilal Oswal Ideation Conference, Agrawal spoke on various matters including foreign fund flows, market valuations and government’s reforms. Edited excerpts:Has the market has already factored in possibility of the BJP coming back to power?Market in its own wisdom tries to capture both greed and fear. The optimism that BJP will win 250-260 seats has been captured for sure. But they have also captured that it may not come. It is a very fluid situation. The market is giving a payoff matrix that 300 is probably 5% chance, 250-there is a 60% chance and 210 has another 30-40% chance. The market is actually discounting 230-235. So, if 260 actually happens, the market may take off. Larger the mandate for Modi, he will get a signal that he is on the right track.",HDB,en,The Economic Times India

2019-03-21 13:13:30-05:00,Decoded: The what and why of RBI's currency swap move,"By Abheek BaruaThe initial commentary on RBI’s new swap mechanism to infuse liquidity or cash ($5 billion, or Rs 35,000 crore) into the banking system has raised more questions than provided answers. This is understandable primarily because it is being tried for the first time. Also, while the very nature of the mechanism means that it has a direct impact on both the money and forex markets, RBI has not been clear about what it wants to achieve by trying a new tack. RBI wants to infuse durable liquidity into the banking system. ‘Durable’ refers to the fact that the infusion is permanent, unlike, say, the repurchase (repo) window where a bank swaps cash for government bonds for a short period, say, a day or a week, and then pays RBI back at the end of this period. The conventional mode for durable cash injection has been the Open Market Operation (OMO), in which RBI buys back specific bonds from banks in lieu of cash.Call for GreenbacksUnder the new swap, RBI wants to buy dollars from banks instead of bonds, but wants to return these dollars at the end of three years for a ‘forward’ premium.",HDB,en,The Economic Times India
