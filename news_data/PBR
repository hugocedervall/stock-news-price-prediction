Rystad warned that a second wave scenario could cut 3 million barrels a day in production towards the end of the year and 3.5 million barrels a day in December 2021, eroded by demand reduction for jet fuel, petrol, diesel and other fuels. Rystad envisioned oil prices recovering to a base-case scenario of US$75 a barrel in late 2022 from the curtailment of global oil production as demand gradually improves, which could set the next down cycle in 2023–2024. However, a more volatile upcycle could mean over-US$90 a barrel prices by mid-2022, followed by a more drastic collapse to US$30 a barrel in 2024 from potential overinvestments.","PBR.A,PBR",en,The Sun Daily

2020-06-12 03:53:41-05:00,'Supporting stranding': UK Export Finance accused of funding oil projects in defiance of Paris Agreement goals,"New analysis from Carbon Tracker warns UK government financing for upstream oil and gas projects in Brazil and Ghana is 'failing the Paris test' Carbon Tracker has today published an analysis of UK Export Finance's (UKEF) support for oil and gas projects in Brazil and Ghana, which concludes the assets are ""highly likely to become stranded"" if the world honours the commitments made in the Paris Agreement. The influential think tank undertook an analysis of two upstream projects that were supported by the UKEF following an inquiry last year by the Parliamentary Environmental Audit Committee (EAC), which highlighted how the government agency was funding fossil fuel projects around the world even as the UK remained committed to delivering net zero emissions and complying with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Carbon Tracker applied its methodology for assessing whether projects are at risk of becoming stranded assets in the event the world meets the Paris goal of keeping temperatures 'well below' 2C to two deals: UKEF's direct loan and loan guarantee to the Offshore Cape Three Points (OCTP) project in Ghana, which was approved in 2017 with a maximum liability of $380m; and the line of credit extended to Petrobras for exploration and production in the Campos, Santos and Espirito Santos basins of Brazil, which was approved in 2018 and has a maximum liability of £248m in 2018-19 leading to a cumulative annual exposure to Petrobras since the 2011/12 financial year is £2.2bn.","PBR.A,PBR",en,BusinessGreen

2020-06-05 01:38:10-05:00,The Brazilian drilling market hurdles,"<span/> The drilling market has always been the first and most impacted when there is a crisis in the oil and gas segment, especially by the decrease in exploration. Drilling is a key indicator of the level of short- and medium-term activities expected for the entire sector. Globally, the current scenario is not too optimistic, as suppliers have already registered losses in the first quarter of the year, with the sector hit hard by the COVID-19 economic and health crisis. <span/> Nonetheless, there are some differences between the current downturn and the one in 2014-15, especially in Brazil. In the previous downturn, the Brazilian upstream market was concentrated around Petrobras to develop the presalt, with high local content rules and few bid rounds. In addition to the oil crash, the operator faced a perfect storm owing to a lack of cash flow and a paralyzing corruption scandal. In the middle of the scandal investigation, Brazilian suppliers had to not only restructure their debt but also handle reduced demand and Petrobras's blockage of new contracts.","PBR.A,PBR",en,IHS Markit

2020-05-26 00:35:17-05:00,OSV market in Brazil: recovery postponed,"<span/> Although coronavirus (COVID-19) and low oil prices will reduce activity, operators which have already rig contracts will likely stick with the drilling plan but with a smaller number of wells. This time drilling activity will be in both exploration at new wildcats and in some development wells. Shell, ExxonMobil and Petrobras are expected to spud new exploration wells in 2020 and Petrobras will continue focusing drilling wells at pre-salt fields in the Mero and Buzios fields, and maybe some Campos assets like Roncador and Albacora. These will be the main drivers of the demand for AHTS that works in the anchorage, supply and installation activities associated with drilling and hook-up of new FPSOs or MODUs (mobile offshore drilling units). Adding to the reductions in the demand for new wells, Petrobras is hibernating several shallow water units, dropping also the demand for general purpose PSVs. Furthermore, some OSV operations have been suspended in Rio de Janeiro (from where the presalt and Campos are served), after some cases of COVID-19 contamination in crews were found.","PBR.A,PBR",en,IHS Markit

In just a few months, the coronavirus pandemic has destroyed so much fuel demand as billions of people curtail travel that it has done what financial crashes, recessions and wars had failed to ever do – leave the United States with so much oil there was nowhere to put it. While the unusual circumstance of negative oil prices may not be repeated, many in the industry say it is a harbinger for more bleak days ahead, and that years of overinvestment will not correct in a period of weeks or even months.

The main implication of the attack is the threatening of Brazil's trade with Iran, while increasing the risks of additional US sanctions against Venezuela, and the US taking a tougher stance on Argentina's efforts to reschedule its IMF liabilities if the country shifts its neutral approach towards supporting Iran. President Jair Bolsonaro's open endorsement of the US government's action increases risks for Brazilian exports to Iran. His stance will also increase terrorist risks against US assets, but neither Hizbullah nor any radical terrorist group with presence in the triple border (Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina) area have carried out terrorist attacks in Brazil successfully.

Before the reforms, annual crude output at the state-owned oil company, Petróleos Mexicanos, which is usually shortened to Pemex, had been waning for the past decade. In response, then-President Calderón called for the reforms in 2013 and subsequent President Enrique Peña Nieto enacted them the next year, ending the government's 75-year oil production monopoly and opening the Mexican energy sector to private investment. (Photo credit: Jim Allen/FreightWaves) Beyond the initial capital infusion, foreign firms offer to share cutting-edge techniques for discovery, drilling and ecological sustainability. This was sorely lacking at Pemex at the time the reforms were initially introduced. And to add insult to injury, British Petroleum and Petrobras, the state-owned oil company of Brazil, had just discovered a record-breaking oil reserve in the Gulf of Mexico in 2009 that could top off at four to six billion barrels.","PBR.A,PBR",en,Benzinga Feeds

Chevron has four joint ventures with PDVSA in Venezuela, whose output can reach about 200,000 b/d of the total 700,000 b/d currently produced in the country. Meanwhile, Russia's state-owned oil giant Rosneft is understood to be planning to take control of PDVSA. Having been one of the biggest lenders to PDVSA, Rosneft has interests to secure that will be paid back. Russia and Venezuela agreed two years ago on a debt restructuring for USD 3.15 billion over a decade, with minimum payments in the first six years. Payments have to be made twice a year, in March and September, with no clarity on whether Venezuela has paid so far this year.","PBR.A,PBR",en,IHS Markit

The strike action is over the company's proposed annual wage hikes, which stand lower than the expected annual inflation rate, the strike could come less than a month before Brazil holds its biggest oil auction yet. This auction includes assets worth as much as USD 50 billion, such as blocks previously explored by Petrobras, with estimates suggesting that up to 15 billion barrels could still remain to be explored. The winning bidders will have to arrange compensation for Petrobras for having already explored part of this area. The company expects to net anywhere from USD 25 to 45 billion. Oil majors including Exxon Mobil and Shell have expressed their interest. Buzios, one of four prospects (together with Itapu, Sepia and Atapu) at the heart of the pre-salt oil deposits, is already the second-largest field by production in Brazil, with output having surpassed 400,000 b/d, with four platforms already operating and at least three more to follow.","PBR.A,PBR",en,IHS Markit

Brazil is blaming Venezuela, but the oil's origin is still unclear, and now Brasilia is sending in thousands of troops to help clean it up. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . Brazil's environment minister said Wednesday that the government will call on the Organization of American States to demand an answer from Venezuela over a mysterious oil spill affecting a large part of Brazil's northeastern coast. In an official message broadcast on TV, the minister, Ricardo Salles, insisted that the oil is Venezuelan, a claim the Brazilian government has maintained for over a week, though it hasn't directly blamed Venezuela's government. Hundreds of tons of oil have washed up on shore in many of Brazil's northeastern beaches, and its origins have not yet been fully explained. Brazil's environmental agency, Ibama, began investigating the oil on September 2 and has said that an 1,860-mile swath of coastline in Brazil's Northeast region — some of the nicest beaches in the country — had been hit by the spill.","PBR.A,PBR",en,Business Insider
