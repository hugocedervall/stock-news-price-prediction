After all, one reason investors love tech stocks is that they're remarkably efficient at making tons of money. But is there such a thing as too much of a good thing?

While he's naturally looking for profitable companies and has substantial investments in tech, he says he wants to see companies that are planning ahead. ""We don't want to see margins sort of going through the roof, because maybe that's an example of companies taking too much profit in the short term,"" he said. ""What we like are companies [where] maybe the margins go up a little bit every year, but not as much as they could do."" Dudding says it's often wiser for companies to plow money back into advertising, product development, and other areas that will improve their businesses over the longer term.

2020-09-11 00:53:24-05:00,Why Reliance valuations may not be sustainable,"eliance’s ROE is in single digits and a story is getting built here because valuation is getting ascribed by private investors, says the analyst, asksandipsabharwal.com. The profit of Reliance is not double that of TCS and HDFC Bank put together, but the market cap is. What do you think?It has been driven by people not knowing how to value a particular stock and that is happening in many technology stocks in the US also. People do not know how to figure out the actual valuation of the Jio platform and that is leading to this sort of valuation change. In fact, over the last 10 years, Reliance has not generated free cash flows in even a single year. When you compare it to companies like TCS or HDFC Bank or any other company which has a high ROE, Reliance’s ROE is in single digits. There is a story that is getting built because valuation is getting ascribed by private investors. The future returns depend on execution. They need to execute and they need to generate cash flows because without cash flows, I do not think the valuations will be sustainable.",KMB,en,Economic Times India

I would not necessarily take it as a disappointment if the PAT is lower for one quarter here and there. I would look more directionally, if the balance sheet outcomes are stronger than P&L actually.

Fitch Ratings Inc. expects that India will grow only 2% in the current financial year. That would be the lowest rate in decades, a level not seen since this country was closed-off socialist backwater.But everyone knows that fighting a pandemic is costly. What’s even more worrying is how the costs of a slowdown—the sudden pressure on incomes and demand, in particular—will widen pre-existing cracks in the Indian growth story.The weakest link in the Indian economy is its banking sector. This has been the case for some time: The banks’ books have still not recovered from over-exuberant lending to industry back in the boom years. Weighed down by all the bad debt they took on, they have been reluctant to lend to new projects since then. That’s part of the reason that private investment in India slowed to a crawl last year and dragged growth down with it.But, through this difficult period, Indian banks—and indeed, the economy more generally—could rely on strong household demand.",KMB,en,Economic Times India

The dashboard is a measure of “animal spirits,” a term coined by British economist John Maynard Keynes to refer to investors’ confidence in taking action. 69438514 While the monthly PMI numbers and other indicators suggested a weakening in growth, the three-month weighted average -- to smooth out volatility in the single-month readings -- was positive.The results support a view that growth will rebound from here on after probably cooling for a fourth consecutive quarter to 6.5% in the three months to March, the weakest pace since mid-2017.

2019-05-21 21:07:02-05:00,Some banks make record provisions against bad loans,"MUMBAI: Banks have used the past one year to improve their provision coverage ratio (PCR) as they clean up their books and strengthen balance sheets amid a slowdown in fresh additions to bad loans.PCR is at record levels for some banks, which is a positive because it makes bank numbers more reliable and increases chances of a write-back from bad assets.Data analysed by ET showed that there has been a secular upward trend in PCR.For example, State Bank of India’s (SBI) PCR increased to 78.73% in March 2019 from 74.63% a year earlier. For ICICI Bank, the upward move has been even sharper — to 80.60% from 60.40% a year earlier.PCRs for Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, RBL Bank and also state-owned banks such as Canara Bank and Bank of India have also climbed.PCR is the ratio of provisioning to gross non-performing assets and indicates the extent of funds a bank has kept aside to cover loan losses.A 100% PCR means that a bank has set aside 100% of doubtful loans to cover eventual losses.Analysts said higher PCR is also related to higher provisions banks may have had to take for NPAs that have aged.“Banks have taken additional provisions during the quarter on ageing related NPAs and also in a few cases, 100% provisions on some NCLT accounts.",KMB,en,The Economic Times India

South Korea switched on 5G networks nationwide in April, with data speeds of about 1.5 gigabits per second. Businesses are counting on 5G to deliver artificial-intelligence-based robots, 3D content, and holograms that they say will someday be a part of people’s daily lives. The higher speeds will enable companies including automakers and wireless carriers to connect devices with vehicles, home appliances, and buildings. And because the country also boasts the world’s highest robot density, some of these same companies, such as Hyundai, LG, and Samsung, are trying to develop bots that will provide some fixes for problems like a rapidly aging population and rising labor costs.

The deficit is pegged at Rs 40,859 crore compared with a Rs 15,857 crore surplus at the same time last year, according to data from the Bloomberg banking liquidity gauge.“Government spending has come to a grinding halt since April,” said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economist at State Bank of India. “This is resulting in an unusual spike in the liquidity deficit.”The surprise squeeze could be an obstacle in interest rate transmission. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has lowered benchmark interest rates at its last two reviews to perk up the sluggish economy. Tighter liquidity will make banks reluctant to lower rates.“The existing liquidity deficit in April is unprecedented,” said Upasna Bhardwaj, senior economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank. “Lack of government spending has primarily triggered this shortfall in the country’s banking system. Going ahead in the next two weeks, we expect the system liquidity deficit to tighten further on the back of outflows from GST (goods and services tax) collections and auctions in the absence of aggressive government spending.”‘CREDIT GROWTH HIGHER THAN DEPOSIT GROWTH’To be sure, the situation is easier than it was in April when the liquidity deficit was as much as Rs 1.49 lakh crore.",KMB,en,The Economic Times India

2019-05-06 12:28:50-05:00,Why it's better for India to have bigger but fewer banks,"By Hasmukh AdhiaThe recent successful merger of two public sector banks (PSBs), Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank, with Bank of Baroda has paved the way for the future road map of PSB restructuring. It has created the right synergy, achieved scale and resulted in better shareholder value creation. It would be wrong to think that this move of GoI was in response to the difficult conditions that many PSBs find themselves in. Nor was it meant to provide protection to a ‘weak’ bank like Dena Bank (as it is perceived to be). This amalgamation is the result of a deliberated choice in the present world economy.It is incongruous for the world’s sixth-largest economy by GDP in 2018 to not have a bank ranked in the world’s top 25 by size; China has six. The UK, whom we will overtake to become the fifth-largest economy this year, has three. Canada, the 10thlargest economy, has two, and Spain ranked 13th has one. In the world’s top-ranked 100 banks by assets, India has one: SBI, which is ranked 60th. Clearly, size matters.To be globally competitive, we have to build banks that are bigger and stronger than what we have at this time.",KMB,en,The Economic Times India

Other contributing factors might be higher cash withdrawal, weaker foreign exchange inflows and higher CRR (cash reserve ratio) balances of banks,” he said.The deficit is at Rs 70,266 crore on April 16 compared to Rs 31,396 crore on April 3, data from the Bloomberg India Banking Liquidity gauge showed.During the same period, the system was running in surplus cash in the range of Rs 33,400 and Rs 84,600 crore although New Delhi’s currency swap programme (DeMon) increased cash in the banking system around that period.",KMB,en,The Economic Times India
