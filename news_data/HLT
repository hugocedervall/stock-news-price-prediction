2020-09-22 09:49:26-05:00,Wondering whether to go long on growth or value stocks? JP Morgan's take on EPS estimates could help answer the question.,"Summary List Placement Growth stocks have once again outperformed value stocks over the past two weeks, said JP Morgan's equity analyst, Mislav Matejka, in a note on Monday. He expects this trend to continue. This year, there was a widespread view that non-fundamental factors were key in driving stock selection, Matejka said. But JP Morgan has found that, generally, stocks with more robust earnings delivery have had a much higher chance of outperforming. ""In the majority of sectors, 70%-100% of stock outperformers displayed better relative [earnings per share] momentum than their sector and the market, and vice versa,"" Matejka said. But JP Morgan is predicting that momentum in earnings per share is about to change due to a slowdown in economic activity. The general consensus among analysts is that value and cyclical sector stocks are expected to grow at a much faster pace than the rest of the market, producing double-digit earnings growth in 2021, Matejka said. But when combining the higher earnings hurdle rates for these sectors compared to the rest of the market and the likely slowdown in activity, these sectors could see EPS revisions that rarely remain in positive territory, Matejka said. ""We see significant risk of disappointment [in cyclicals and value sectors],"" Matejka said.",HLT,en,Business Insider
