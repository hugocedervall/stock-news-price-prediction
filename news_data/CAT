Named the furry puss caterpillar —perhaps for its resemblance to less venomous house cats— people who brush up against its hairy coat have a painful reaction. And according to the Virginia Department of Forestry (VDOF), there have been reports of the puss caterpillar in a few eastern Virginia counties. "" #SocialDistance away from this caterpillar!"" the VDOF wrote on its Facebook Tuesday. The caterpillar's sting can send people to the hospital The insect's fuzzy veneer hides venomous spines. As the caterpillars grow in size, before they change into equally fuzzy southern flannel moths, their venom becomes more toxic. Their painful sting is followed by swelling and redness, but those who get stung may also experience symptoms like headaches, fever, nausea, vomiting, low blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, seizure, and in rare cases, abdominal pain, according to a 2005 paper published in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.",CAT,en,Business Insider

It's called the puss caterpillar, and if you touch it you're in for some serious discomfort . The caterpillar is covered in hair, making it look particularly odd, but that hair hides a painful secret. As the Virginia Department of Forestry explains in a new post on Facebook, the hairs hide venomous spines that can inflict serious pain as well as a host of other symptoms that sound absolutely terrible.

The numbers outside of costs were dismal: sales fell across the company’s segments, with dealers slashing inventories by $1.4 billion signaling a market that remains glutted with equipment. And while Caterpillar declined to provide forward guidance, it sees a similar percentage decrease in end-user demand in the third quarter, and expects dealers to cut stockpiles by more than $2 billion for the full year. ""Unfavorable price realization also contributed to the sales decline due to the geographic mix of sales and competitive market conditions in China,” the company said. “Sales were lower across all regions and in the three primary segments."" And while the earnings were enough to help push the stock higher premarket, it has since slumped into the red after the company unveiled its latest global retail sales data , which showed that despite a modest, 7% increase in Asia-Pac sales, which rose for the first time since April 2019, it was the continued crash in global sales which tumbled by 23% Y/Y for the second month in a row, the biggest decline since 2010.",CAT,en,Zero Hedge

After it hatches, the caterpillar spends 10 months on a willow, followed by three weeks pupating upside down. Out of this emerges a giant butterfly like no other in the UK. The female purple emperor ( Apatura iris ) is “bold, brown and brazen”, while the male is “stunningly beautiful, with shimmering wings of iridescent blues, purples and violets”. With a wing span of about 8cm, the males are immensely powerful and will defend their treetop territories against all comers, including birds and even drones. Mysterious, elusive and enthralling, the beauty of this tropical looking butterfly is fleeting; it lives a mere 10 days.

What they might not have expected was for it to happen so suddenly here at the start of the year. Last night’s U.S. action in the Middle East sent crude prices spiking. Stock futures tumbled, giving back basically all the gains from Thursday in pre-market trading early Friday. Crude is back where it was in September after the attack on Saudi oil facilities, up above $63 a barrel. Iran has vowed to retaliate, so investors might be on tenterhooks waiting for that. Volatility, which dropped sharply Thursday, scurried quickly back above 15 for the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX). One thing investors don’t want to do here is panic. Making moves out of fear isn’t a strategy. Instead, it’s often better to be prudent and let things play out. Sometimes these geopolitical situations seem scary and threatening at the start but don’t end up having a major long-term impact on markets.

2019-01-30 18:35:00-05:00,A Markets Game Plan For US-China Trade Talks,"Authored by Garfield Reynolds, Bloomberg markets live commentator For markets, trade talks dominate everything else this week, so here’s a simplified game plan for how it might play out. China’s cooling economy, soggy earnings from the likes of Caterpillar, Nvidia, Harley Davidson, plus a slew of weak export data prints have helped create a consensus that what the markets need more than anything else is trade peace. Such a view may be naïve. China deleveraging, Brexit, Italy, the U.S. shutdown have all done plenty of harm too. Plus, repairing the already-seen trade war damage will be a gradual and difficult process. But that’s mostly beside the point -- the talks are highly likely to set off extreme, sustained market moves because sentiment has become so sensitive to the trade war. Considering that, the potential scenarios could be roughly delineated as follows: Trade talks break down and the trade war escalates No concrete steps, but positive sounds and more talks planned Agreement on tariffs announced, but IP/tech issues go onto a separate track for longer-term talks Agreement announced on both tariffs and IP The first scenario will be the easiest for traders to react to.",CAT,en,Zero Hedge

2019-01-28 07:55:43-05:00,"Caterpiller Tumbles, Drags Dow Lower On Huge Miss, Poor Guidance","All eyes were on industrial bellwether Caterpillar's Q4 earnings this morning for confirmation whether the China slowdown is indeed trickling down into China-facing US companies (after China reported overnight that total industrial profits posted a second consecutive Y/Y decline in December, sliding -1.9% vs -1.8% in November), and that's precisely what CAT reported, when it announced Q4 EPS of $2.55, a huge miss to expectations of $2.99, on revenue of $14.3BN, also slightly below the $14.36BN expected. While the numbers were not a disaster on a comparable basis, with sales up 11% from a year earlier, while adjusted EPS also rising 18% from Q4 2017, the EPS miss was the biggest in over 3 years as Wall Street failed to adjusted its expectations lower for what is clearly a China slowdown story. Some more troubling highlights from the report via Bloomberg: For 2018, the mark-to-market adjustment on pension and OPEB plans was a net loss of $495 million, primarily due to lower than expected returns on plan assets, partially offset by higher interest rates During the fourth quarter of 2018, CAT recognized a $50 million increase to the estimated charge for the cost of mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S.",CAT,en,Zero Hedge
