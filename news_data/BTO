O interesse nessas questões tem dominado as conversas com partes interessadas, no último ano, disseram diretores-presidentes de mineradoras antes do Gold Forum Americas, conferência organizada pela Denver Gold Group, um evento anual importante no mundo dos metais preciosos. Essas conversas coincidem com bilhões de dólares colocados em ofertas de ações de mineradoras de ouro, antes evitadas. Generalistas olham para o ouro por causa dos preços altos e do “forte argumento de que o preço do ouro pode subir”, de acordo com Sean Boyd, CEO da Agnico Eagle Mines, uma das 10 maiores produtoras de ouro. E esses investidores tendem a julgar empresas de mineração pelas lentes ESG. “Eles não querem correr muitos riscos, e uma grande parte da avaliação de risco é pelo lado ESG”, disse Boyd em entrevista por telefone.","BTG,BTO",pt,Valor Econômico
