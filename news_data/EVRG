2020-11-10 13:16:00-05:00,Report: Evergy Rebuffs NextEra Energy’s $15B Acquisition Offer,"Midwestern utility Evergy rebuffed a $15 billion acquisition bid from NextEra Energy, according to a report from Reuters. If accurate, the news marks the latest unsuccessful attempt by the U.S. renewable energy leader to take advantage of its high stock price to expand its roster of regulated utilities. Evergy representatives did not immediately reply to Greentech Media’s request for comment on Reuters’ anonymously sourced report, which stated that the all-stock acquisition offer was rejected by Evergy in recent days. Debbie Larsson, a spokesperson for NextEra Energy, said in a Tuesday interview with Greentech Media that the company does not comment on market rumors as a matter of policy. Evergy, which serves 1.6 million customers in Kansas and Missouri, was formed in 2018 by the merger of Westar Energy and Kansas City Power & Light parent company Great Plains Energy. It was under pressure from shareholder Elliott Management Corp. to seek a buyer last year, but its board of directors acted to forestall the prospect of a takeover.","ETR,EVRG",en,Green Technology Media

2020-02-03 15:12:01-05:00,Midwestern Utility Evergy Pledges Carbon Cuts in Line with Paris Accord,"Evergy has become the latest utility to pledge to long-term carbon cuts even though the states it serves, Kansas and Missouri, aren’t demanding them. On Friday, the 1 million-customer utility, formed last year by the merger of Westar Energy and Kansas City Power & Light parent company Great Plains Energy, announced plans to cut carbon emission by 80 percent from 2005 levels by 2050. While that’s not as aggressive as the zero-carbon goals being followed by utilities in states like California, Hawaii and New York, it’s in line with meeting the terms of the Paris Climate Accord, the utility said. Since 2005, Evergy has reduced its share of coal-fired power in its 6.2-gigawatt generation fleet from 52 percent to 40 percent, while reducing natural gas and oil from 38 percent to 26 percent. At the same time, it increased its share of renewables from less than 1 percent to roughly 27 percent, almost entirely wind power, with nearly 3.9 gigawatts of nameplate capacity as of 2020. These changes have already gotten Evergy to a 40-percent reduction in emissions from 2005 levels.",EVRG,en,Green Technology
