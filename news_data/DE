2020-02-20 09:39:33-05:00,China Stimulus Doesn't Translate Into US Strength As Deere Prepares To Report Friday,"Today’s question is what can the market do to follow up another record-high close. With catalysts kind of thin, it might be hard to keep the spark in this rally, at least for the moment. Futures had a weaker tone before the opening bell despite positive news about China cutting its primary loan rate. The China stimulus didn’t seem to have much impact outside of China, where stocks rose nearly 2%. European markets fell, U.S. Treasury yields dropped, and the dollar continued to roll up gains vs. the euro as investors apparently still sought potential safety of dollar-denominated assets. On the plus side, crude has really turned things around this week, with front-month crude futures (/CL) starting the day around $54 a barrel. We’re approaching the end of another week, so even though this may sound like a broken record, investors might want to stay on their toes today and tomorrow for some potential profit-taking pressure ahead of the weekend. It didn’t really turn into a factor last Friday, and volatility was on the decline yesterday, but being extra careful isn’t a bad thing.",DE,en,Benzinga
