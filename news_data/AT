2020-09-21 15:27:09-05:00,Queda nas ações coloca S&P 500 a caminho do pior mês de setembro desde 2011,"O avanço da pandemia, as incertezas políticas nos EUA e a leniência de instituições financeiras com casos de lavagem de dinheiro afastaram os investidores de ativos de risco Um acúmulo de fatores negativos freou o apetite dos agentes financeiros globais por ativos de risco nesta segunda-feira (21), impondo mais um fechamento negativo às ações em Nova York. Com a queda diária, o S&P 500 ampliou suas perdas em setembro a 6,26%, caminhando para encerrar sua maior desvalorização para o mês desde 2011, quando teve queda de 7,18%. O avanço contínuo da pandemia de covid-19 em diversas regiões do mundo, além de incertezas políticas nos Estados Unidos e reportagens que apontaram a leniência de grandes instituições financeiras ao redor do mundo com casos de lavagem de dinheiro e outras práticas ilícitas afastaram os investidores de ativos de risco hoje. No fim do dia, no entanto, a recuperação nas ações da Apple (+3,03%) e da Microsoft (+1,07%) ajudaram os índices a moderar as perdas. Na Bolsa de Valores de Nova York (Nyse), o Dow Jones terminou o dia em queda de 1,84%, aos 27.147,70 pontos, enquanto o S&P 500 recuou 1,16%, aos 3.281,06 pontos.",AT,pt,Valor Econômico
