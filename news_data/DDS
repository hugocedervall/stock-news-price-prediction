2020-12-03 12:06:04-05:00,This might be the worst iPhone 12 bug since launch,"iPhone 12 owners are reporting accelerated battery drain on their new phones, even while idling. Hundreds of users on the Apple Communities forum say that the batteries on their iPhone 12 models are dying far too quickly even when they turn off 5G or activate Low Power Mode. Apple has yet to address the issue, but it seems likely that it's a software bug in iOS. No product launch is complete without a bug or two, and according to hundreds of users on the Apple Communities forum , the new iPhone 12 models are experiencing a serious bug that is affecting battery life. As spotted by 9to5Mac , a user on the forum started a thread about the battery on their iPhone 12 Pro draining much more quickly than they'd expected on October 25th. In the weeks since, hundreds more have echoed this complaint. BGR's Top Deal of the Day Here's what user Master26A said in his original post about the accelerated battery drain on his iPhone 12 Pro: Trying to work out if I have a defective unit I need to send back or if there's a wider issue here.",DDS,en,BGR

2020-12-01 17:35:55-05:00,Here’s how long it takes to catch COVID if you’re in a room with someone who has it,"Researchers from MIT put together a website that reveals how long it takes to catch the coronavirus when in a room with someone who has it. The risk of transmission is dependant on a few variables (room size, mask-wearing) that users on the website can tweak to fit their environment. Indoor gatherings are disproportionately responsible for coronavirus transmissions. If you find yourself at an indoor gathering, it's imperative to wear a mask and to adhere to social distancing guidelines. Though the coronavirus can spread more readily than the flu, the reality is that simply being in the same room as someone who has the virus doesn't automatically mean you're going to contract it yourself. Even when indoors -- where the coronavirus is more likely to spread -- the virus' ability to spread from one person to another depends on a variety of factors such as air circulation, whether or not people are wearing masks, social distancing, the viral load of the infected person, the size of the indoor space, and more.",DDS,en,BGR

The original deal had GM taking a $2 billion stake in Nikola, amounting to 11% of the company. The Detroit carmaker would be paid $700 million to manufacture Nikola's Badger pickup truck and would provide the Arizona-based startup, founded in 2014, with both fuel-cell and electric powertrains — the latter a showcase for GM's Ultium electric technology. It was a chance for GM to put its cutting-edge technologies into what GM CEO Mary Barra called an ""industry-leading disrupter."" And for Nikola, GM brought the manufacturing expertise and powertrain systems that the startup completely lacked. Nikola had already gone public through a blank-check merger with VectoIQ, a ""special purpose acquisition company,"" or SPAC, set up by former GM board member Steve Girsky.",DDS,en,Business Insider

And while it was considered in poor taste until earlier this year to admit that the market levitation is entirely due to the Fed's manipulation of markets- a task best left to fringe, tinfoil wearing blogs - all pretense disappeared after Jerome Powell nationalized the bond market in March, and just last week Morgan Stanley's chief rates strategist, Matthew Hornbach, admitted that central bank liquidity is the most critical component of rising macro markets: ""It both greases the wheels of transactional finance and changes the opportunity set available to investors."" It's also why Morgan Stanley has been especially bullish on markets in 2021: as Hornbach summarized it simply: ""When it comes to liquidity, our focus is on both ""narrow"" and ""broad"" measures…",DDS,en,Zero Hedge

The Trump administration notified Congress on Monday that it intends to sell the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS; the Standoff Land Attack Missile-Expanded Response, or SLAM-ER; and external sensor pods for F-16 fighters. On Tuesday, the White House said it planned to sell MQ-9 drones and Harpoon anti-ship missiles. Reuters first reported both informal notifications, which allow lawmakers to review sales before the State Department sends a formal notification.

2019-04-09 13:57:57-05:00,The real reason you still feel tired after taking a nap — and the 3 things that might help,"One of the reasons you might feel tired after a nap is if you slept for too long. Some experts believe that taking a 20-minute to 30-minute nap is ideal if you want to feel more awake and avoid impacting your regular sleep schedule. Some experts also suggest that napping in your own bed and napping earlier in the day can help you achieve a better rest. Visit INSIDER.com for more stories. Sometimes a nap will leave you feeling rejuvenated and full of energy. Other times, you'll encounter the not-so-great post-nap feeling of waking up as tired or more tired than you were before. As it turns out, there are a few things that could be making your naps so unsatisfying. Here's what you need to know about taking the perfect nap, plus mistakes that could be contributing to your post-nap tiredness. If you feel tired after a nap, it may be because you slept for too long ""If you nap for too long and wake abruptly from a deeper stage of sleep, you can feel groggy and lethargic upon awakening,"" said Martin Reed , a certified clinical sleep health expert. ""This is known as sleep inertia and can be avoided by allotting less time for a nap."" According to Reed, the ideal amount of time to nap for is about 20 minutes to 30 minutes ""so you are less likely to enter the deeper stages of sleep."" According to Sleep.org, if you are able to do so, taking a 90-minute nap could be even more ideal.",DDS,en,Business Insider

This report is exclusively available to enterprise subscribers. To learn more about getting access to this report, email Senior Account Executive Jeff Jordan at jjordan@businessinsider.com , or check to see if your company already has access . Although competition in the US wireless carrier market remains fierce, the price war among the Big Four US carriers — Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint — began to cool over the past year. In an attempt to avoid further competition on price, carriers began shifting their focus to adding value to their mobile plans with new offerings to differentiate from the competition. This helped average revenue per user (ARPU) start to stabilize across all carriers in Q1 2018, after declining over the last two years. The Big Four have now begun reshuffling their unlimited plans to lure subscribers by providing more options. This strategy has been unrolling in two flavors: introducing new, expensive unlimited plan tiers loaded with an array of features and choices, while also catering to price-sensitive customers with more affordable plans that strip away extra perks like free digital content and international coverage.",DDS,en,Business Insider

DSW, which has changed its name to Designer Brands with a new ticker, ""DBI,"" that will go into effect April 2, announced during its Tuesday investor day that it will focus on exclusive merchandise. ""This increase in private label goods made by Camuto will over time replace the 700 labels (20% of the mix today) that do not warrant shelf space,"" Canaccord wrote. ""While we see the potential behind this strategy, we also see risks DSW may not be accounting for, namely risk to Camuto's private label wholesale business with Dillard's and Macy's."" Canaccord analysts are concerned that Dillard's Inc. and Macy's Inc. would move their business elsewhere to reduce competition.
