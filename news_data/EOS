The EOS M50 Mark II features an enhanced Eye Detection AF, which is able to detect and focus on a subject's eye even when the person is far away. This will ensure the eye will always stay in focus, making it possible to use Eye Detection AF for full body shots in addition to the common upper body portrait shot. With a shooting speed of up to 7.4fps with servo AF the camera aims to capture multiple shots of moving subjects such as children or pets. Its built-in high-resolution electronic viewfinder (EVF) makes for easy viewing even when shooting in the bright outdoors. Servo AF is an auto focus function that allows a photographer to keep a moving object automatically focused based on the camera's setting. The EOS M50 Mark II makes full use of its touch-sensitive display with the new Tap AF feature where users can instantly switch focus from one person to another by just tapping on the screen, which is especially useful in group shots.",EOS,en,Sify.com

Two crypto enthusiasts just made a $10,000 Bitcoin bet on the next US president using a smart contract. According to a Sept. 8 post from podcaster Marty Bent, the Bitcoin ( BTC ) mainnet has seen its first ever discreet log contract (DLC), which he calls ""a very important moment in Bitcoin history"". Fitting in with the general theme of 2020, the smart contract is highly political. Nicolas Dorier, a man who claimed to have made BitPay obsolete as a developer of BTCPay, made a bet using a DLC about the next winner of the 2020 Presidential Election in the United States: Donald Trump or Joe Biden. Source: Twitter Dorier’s DLC offer, which can be viewed on Github, is between himself and Suredbits founder Chris Stewart, with Outcome Observer acting as a third-party oracle. “When the election is finalized, the Outcome Observer will broadcast a signature that either I or Nicolas can use to settle the bet,” said Stewart. “If Trump wins, Nicolas will receive 1 BTC.",EOS,en,Cointelegraph

We also break down how to use just about any camera as a webcam, and the software you need to do it. As more and more people work from home, there is an increase in demand for webcams, which allow them to connect remotely with their colleagues via web conferencing software. People who own desktop computers may not own a webcam, for example, while those with laptops may want to capture better image quality than what their laptop's built-in webcam can muster. In addition, you can also position a webcam wherever it best suits you, especially if you use multiple monitors, according to Ed Lee, the director and founder of Rise Above Research , a firm that analyzes the digital imaging market.",EOS,en,Business Insider

The question is not about whether it will recover, but what needs to be done to ensure recovery. The “hack” of the DAO runs deep into the collective memory of the cryptocurrency community. After an extremely successful crowdfund in May 2016, the DAO lasted a little over a month before an attacker started to drain funds from the smart contract, taking around $70 million worth of Ether ( ETH ). However, as some pointed out at the time, the DAO incident was not a hack at all. The attacker simply exploited a vulnerability in the underlying smart contract code to make it behave in a way that the programmers didn’t expect. Nevertheless, the incident divided the Ethereum community after a decision was made to implement a hard fork that would return the funds. Fast-forward to early 2020, and there was over $1 billion worth of crypto tied up in decentralized finance. That’s $1 billion under the management of smart contracts.",EOS,en,Cointelegraph

The Ethereum team has been trying to solve the blockchain scalability problem since 2014. During that time, solutions such as Raiden, Plasma, zk-SNARKs, sharding and rollups appeared in the developers’ tool kit. However, the implementation of some of them was constantly delayed, while others proved to be of limited efficacy. This was the issue until Ethereum’s Istanbul hard fork was implemented in December 2019, which gave hope that the network can finally become suitable for corporate use. Cointelegraph attempted to figure out whether the situation with the second-largest cryptocurrency’s scalability has changed and why not all the solutions have cut the mustard. Why should Ethereum scale? The Ethereum ( ETH ) blockchain has become a software for thousands of projects over the past couple of years.

En la misma entrevista, anunciaba: «Están previstos once meses de construcción, y nuestra intención es levantar el telón en el primer trimestre de 1999». Ha hecho falta un poco más -concretamente veintiún años- para que aquel sueño que tuvo Luis Ramírez se haga realidad. Otro Luis, apellidado Álvarez -que comparte con su tocayo un entusiasmo sin límites y un diccionario en el que la palabra obstáculo no aparece-, lo ha hecho realidad. El Gran Teatro Bankia Príncipe Pío echó ayer a andar; se rodará durante unas semanas con el espectáculo «El sentido del humor», con Santiago Segura , José Mota y Florentino Fernández ; y el concierto del holograma de Maria Callas junto a la Orquesta Sinfónica de Bankia. Antonio Banderas Será el musical « A Chorus Line », presentado por Antonio Banderas -que actuará en el estreno, el 4 de abril, y en otras funciones todavía sin confirmar- el que sirva para inaugurar este nuevo espacio, que Luis Álvarez quiere que se convierta -y está convencido de que así será- en uno de los iconos de Madrid.",EOS,es,ABC

In the industrial polymer 3D printer market, HP (now number two in global shipments) saw excellent growth, shipping 347% more printers in Q3 2019 than in Q3 2018 as it continued to roll out its more affordable color-capable units.

We run them through our technology model. And we give you our objective analysis. Period. But this is an exception. Ethereum 2.0 is now finally moving forward in a substantive way, and it’s slated to have far-reaching consequences — not just for Ether itself, but for virtually the entire crypto space. Reason : Ethereum (ETH) remains, far and away, the world’s most popular smart-contract platform. It’s where thousands of projects reside. And it’s the platform where folks all over the world are scrambling to build the virtual economy of the future. The Ethereum network is so popular, in fact, that it’s routinely overloaded. Transaction times become agonizingly slow. Transaction fees become exorbitantly expensive. And it’s mostly been this way since 2017 — a chronic ailment that challenges the best minds. Bad news? Not entirely. Developers and sponsors of other, competing smart-contract platforms often wish they could have the same “disease.” Chronic congestion on the Ethereum network signals vast and growing worldwide adoption, arguably the single most important factor in the long-term success of any cryptocurrency.",EOS,en,Benzinga Feeds

EOS Block Producer “EOS New York” has published data purportedly showing that six registered producers on the network are managed by a single entity. In a tweet published on Nov. 28, EOS New York raised concern over the apparent levels of centralization and misconduct, claiming that: “Six registered producers on EOS are managed by a single entity. This is unacceptable. We have requested the signatures of the top 50 registered producers so that all token-holders may know who does and who does not condone such impropriety.” Block Producers and “delegated proof-of-stake” In the EOS ecosystem, Block Producers (BPs) are analogous to miners on the Proof-of-Work -based Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain or staking nodes on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol. The difference with EOS lies in the network’s consensus mechanism, “delegated proof-of-stake,” whereby — in keeping with the governance terms set by the EOS’ constitution — network participants are able to stake their tokens to vote for BPs as “elected delegates.” Rather than merely staking EOS tokens as in a PoS system, Block Producers stake their investment in the network in the form of infrastructure, community support and development.",EOS,en,Cointelegraph

The entire process, from the lathering up to the meditative strokes of the razor to the fact that it's a great excuse to spend five extra minutes in the shower in the mornings is therapeutic to me. What I don't enjoy, however, is razor burn. My skin is sensitive, so even in the summer, I slather my legs in about a gallon of moisturizer to avoid the dry sting that comes after shaving. I'm not saying that the shaving creams on this list totally eliminate the need for moisturizer, though I did skip it while testing them to get a clear idea of how hydrating the formulas really were for me.",EOS,en,Business Insider

2019-03-26 12:41:03-05:00,A Mirrorless Camera That Will Supplement Your Smartphone,"(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- The technology behind mirrorless cameras has improved so dramatically that they can shoot professional-grade images and high-quality 4K video at a fraction of the size and weight of a digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera, which requires a prism to reflect light back into your eye. In the past year, every major brand—including Nikon, Panasonic, and Canon—has jumped on board. The Fujifilm X-T3 ($1,399), released in September, combines an innovative autofocus and top-of-the-line color reproduction with an analog design that harks back to the days of Henri Cartier-Bresson. It even has a “film” setting that’ll apply old-school filters to pictures. The Competition • Nikon Corp. has a dedicated fan base and beloved family of camera lenses. In November it rolled out the Z6 ($1,999 for the body only), the first of two digital mirrorless cameras. At just 585 grams (1.3 pounds) it’s the lightest option on this list. • Sony Corp. has been playing the full-frame mirrorless game for longer than most, and its Alpha7 III ($1,999 for the body only) offers a solid 24.2-megapixel option, a 693-point autofocus system, and one of the longest-lasting batteries available. • Canon Inc.’s first mirrorless camera, the $2,299 EOS R (body only), has a high megapixel count, 30.3, and also provides superb video quality for those looking for a full-frame camera that doesn’t trade size for strength.",EOS,en,Bloomberg
