From 1977 until 1983, when MIGS opened for business, company founder Michael John Stevenson spent seven years developing a technology that would enable labels to be permanently molded on parts. This was before the development of what we know today as in-mold labeling (IML) and in-mold decorating (IMD). Mold In Graphic Systems CEO Marty Mares showed off some Polyfuze label applications to the press and customers during the company's first-ever open house. When MIGS first began operations, its labels were only designed for rotational molding applications. It was considered a “disruptive” technology by the industry and, at first, didn’t receive much of a welcome. For most of its history, MIGS kept its technology and manufacturing facility under wraps. Very few people outside the company were allowed in.
