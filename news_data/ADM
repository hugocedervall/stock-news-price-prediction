Alternatives, or investments like private equity, hedge funds, pieces of art, and venture capital that fall under a loosely defined banner of products that are not traditional stocks and bonds, have grown in size and popularity. Analysts expect wealth managers' allocations to alternatives for their clients to grow. A June estimate from Morgan Stanley and Oliver Wyman pegged illiquid assets and alternative assets for the ultra-high-net-worth set to increase to $24 trillion in 2024 from $16 trillion in 2020. Meanwhile the US government has worked to get private equity and credit into the hands of small-time investors.

2020-07-15 08:24:20,Lower fees for ETFs over mutual funds may lie behind Vanguard asset boost,"Lower fees for ETFs over mutual funds may lie behind Vanguard asset boost Submitted By Beverly Chandler | 15/07/2020 - 9:24am Some controversy has sprung from the announcement earlier this week that in the clash of the US ETF Titans, Vanguard’s assets had overtaken those of BlackRock. ETFs enjoy record inflows with fixed income and ESG taking the lead The widely reported gap in assets between the two was no slim margin, with Vanguard reporting inflows of USD90.4 billion over the first half of the year in its US ETF business, beating its ETF rival BlackRock which gathered ETF inflows of USD60.4 billion. However, questions have been raised, with Morningstar’s Director of Global ETF Research, Ben Johnson, writing on Twitter that the Vanguard inflows were coming ‘from inside the building’. Johnson says: “A portion of the net inflows into Vanguard’s ETFs over the past year can be attributed to shareholders of the funds’ Admiral share class converting to the ETF share class. This likely accelerated after the firm re-priced the ETF share class of many of its funds such that the ETF share class fee is now marginally lower than the fee charged by the Admiral shares.",ADM,en,ETF Express
