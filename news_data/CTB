Schroeder feels confident that Cooper, which introduced three new tires in its WORK Series at the show, is accomplishing this goal as it seeks to land original equipment status at major OEMs. ""The [sales] people getting in the door [is important],"" he said, ""but at the end of the day, it's how the tire performs.""
