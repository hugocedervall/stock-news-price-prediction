2020-11-20 06:18:39-05:00,Elliott Is Said to Bid $872 Million for Swiss Baker Aryzta,"(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire Paul Singer’s Elliott Management Corp. has made a fresh takeover bid for ailing Swiss baking company Aryzta AG, people with knowledge of the matter said. Elliott proposed an offer of about 0.80 Swiss francs per share in recent weeks and reiterated its interest in the past few days, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. That price would represent a 32% premium to Thursday’s close and value Aryzta at about 794 million francs ($872 million), data compiled by Bloomberg show. The U.S. investment firm has conducted due diligence and lined up financing for the potential acquisition, the people said. Aryzta shares rose as much as 21% on Friday, making it the biggest gainer on the benchmark Swiss Performance Index. They were up 17% at 12:46 p.m. in Zurich, giving the company a market value of 703 million francs. Elliott’s proposed offer price is “more than adequate and recommendable” given the challenging environment, Roland French, an analyst at Davy, wrote in an email Friday. “It would mark a significant return” for the company’s activist investors and “clean the psychological slate for many others,” French wrote.",HLI,en,Swiss Info

2020-10-21 10:57:10-05:00,MORGAN STANLEY: Buy these 61 stocks that will offer major earnings-driven upside following an imminent 10% market sell-off,"Summary List Placement When it comes to his outlook on the market for the next few months, Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson is pessimistic. The bank's chief US equity strategist and chief investment officer said in a Monday note that he expects the market to drop another 10% in the near term as investors face uncertainty around the election outcome, more fiscal stimulus, and another wave of COVID-19. But once the dust settles, Wilson said he expects the bull market to ensue — one which will be led by cyclical and smaller-cap stocks as earnings get a boost from the economic recovery. As such, Wilson recommended using a near term sell-off as a buying opportunity. ""We think the best opportunities lie in stocks where earnings are growing with the cyclical rebound and growing by enough to offset any valuation headwinds,"" Wilson said. He continued: ""On any pullbacks, we would look to our earnings upside screen from September — 66% of stocks have outperformed the market with median outperformance of 2.","HOG,HLI",en,Business Insider

Companies that piled on debt in the early stages of the pandemic — thanks in large part to stimulus efforts by the Federal Reserve — may have set themselves up to struggle as the crisis drags on. Houlihan Lokey, Wall Street's top adviser to distressed companies, has changed its outlook: Instead of the sharp but quick downturn they initially anticipated, they're predicting a deeper, prolonged crisis that takes three to five years and pushes many more firms to bankruptcy. ""Everybody wanted to save the economy and keep people working, but at some point there's going to be some pain, and it's not going to be quick or easy to work through the implications of all this added debt,"" William ""Tuck"" Hardie, a managing director with Houlihan Lokey's restructuring business, told Business Insider. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories .

The acknowledgement, confirmed Monday by a flurry of press reports, caused the price of Wirecard shares to halve once again, falling by 45% at its peak, before bouncing slightly. Per CNBC , the search for the missing cash hit a dead-end after two Asian banks, the Philippines-based BDO and BPI, both denied having Wirecard as a client. Furthermore, the Philippines’ central bank said Sunday that the money hadn’t even entered the country’s financial system, exposing yet another one of Wirecard's probably-improvised lies as just that. ""The initial report is that no money entered the Philippines,"" Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Benjamin Diokno said Sunday, adding the names of BDO and BPI were used “in an attempt to cover the perpetrators’ track."" Both banks claimed rogue employees falsified documents to indicate the existence of the funds, suggesting that whistleblowers' claims that the money never existed are probably true.",HLI,en,Zero Hedge
