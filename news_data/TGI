""Based on our estimates, we believe up to 10% of all restaurants globally will disappear, with 20% or more also going through a restructuring process,"" said founder Aaron Allen. ""This is a conservative case, in our view."" Of the roughly 22 million restaurants worldwide, about 2.2 million are expected to shutter operations. Global restaurant traffic data via OpenTable shows little improvement in late June. We noted, on Sunday, June 14, after months of slow improvement, restaurant traffic suddenly plunged , sliding from a -66.5% y/y decline as of June 13 to -78.8% globally. The plunge was mostly due to a sharp drop in U.S. restaurant diners, which plunged by 13% - from -65% to -78% - the biggest one day drop since the start of the shutdown in the U.S., and the second biggest one day drop on record.",TGI,en,Zero Hedge
