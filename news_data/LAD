Here are 3 themes and 9 stocks he's betting on.,"Summary List Placement Brandon Nelson has been running his mutual fund for almost 10 years, and Wall Street has been treating small-company stocks like the minor leagues the entire time. It doesn't bother him. Judged against his peers, Nelson is nobody's backup. His Calamos Timpani Small Cap Growth Fund has returned 252% in that almost-ten-year stretch, a return that tops that of the S&P 500, small-company indexes, and most of his peers, according to Morningstar. This year alone, Nelson had hauled in a 37.1% return as of October 7. Morningstar data shows that's more than double the typical return for the category and more than triple the gain logged by the Russell 2000 Growth index, his benchmark. He thinks investors' views of those companies are due to change. And when they do, even better times might be on the way for his sector. ""It's got a lot of fundamental strength and it's very inexpensive versus large-cap growth,"" he said of small caps in an exclusive interview with Business Insider. "" If money's going to reallocate away from large-cap growth , it seems to me, small-cap growth is a logical place to go."" Nelson says there are essentially two types of growth companies in his portfolio: Cyclical companies that will perform the best when the economy is firing on all cylinders, and secular growth firms benefiting from crucial trends.",LAD,en,Business Insider

The openings are dependent on the government classifying high-street betting shops as supplying a “non-essential” product rather than as part of the hospitality industry, which is not expected to reopen until July. Betting shops had previously been expected to reopen no earlier than 4 July, at the start of the third phase of the government’s steady unwinding of the lockdown. However, following an announcement by Boris Johnson, the prime minister, on Monday evening that all “non-essential” shops can reopen from 15 June, it now seems that the retail betting industry may be back in business just 24 hours before one of the biggest meetings of the year.",LAD,en,The Guardian

2020-04-16 09:08:23-05:00,Ocean Freight Consolidators Turn On LCL Relief Valve,"Ocean freight consolidators are riding a wave of less-than-containerloads (LCL) in recent months as the coronavirus pandemic leaves more freight forwarders beaching full containers. Also known as neutral non-vessel-operating common carriers (NVOCCs), these logistics services providers resell container space to forwarding companies with cargo volumes from shippers which are too small to fill an entire 20-foot or 40-foot container on their own. While a consolidated container may include a multitude of forwarder cargoes, it is generally grouped according to destination. LCL service is also attractive to forwarders who want to avoid subjecting their shippers to more costly airfreight transport for cargo that is not necessarily urgent. Michael Troy II, chief development officer, Troy Container Line [Courtesy Photo] ""We have definitely seen a rise in LCL requests,"" said Michael Troy II, chief development officer of Red Bank, New Jersey-based Troy Container Line , in an interview with American Shipper. ""Many shippers that normally move cargo through FCL and air services are now looking to alternative solutions to meet deadlines and move cargo in these times."" Klaus Jepsen, group CEO of Hoboken, New Jersey-based Shipco Transport , told American Shipper that his NVOCC is receiving increased interest in LCL service from forwarders. ""We are basing it on the fact that there is pressure on air cargo capacity due to the cancellation of pretty much all commercial passenger flights offering cargo capacity and since what cargo freighter capacity is available has become very expensive,"" Jepsen said. ""We also sense that our customers — the freight forwarders and their customers, the BCOs [beneficial cargo owners] — are placing smaller orders to ship them at higher frequency,"" albeit with an ocean container service, he said.",LAD,en,Benzinga Feeds
