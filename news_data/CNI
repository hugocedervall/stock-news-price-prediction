2019-12-12 15:17:02-05:00,Canadian National Grain Shipments Return To Pre-Strike Levels,"Canadian National (NYSE: CNI ) announced that its shipments of grain are moving at a pace similar to that experienced before some of its workers walked out. Approximately 3,200 of the railroad's conductors, trainspersons and yard workers went on an eight-day strike in November. The reduction in force resulted in a 90% decline in network capacity with weekly carloads declining 20% year-over-year and revenue ton-miles declining more than 35%. Demand softness and the strike prompted management to lower its full-year 2019 adjusted earnings-per-share (EPS) guidance. CN's new 2019 guidance calls for EPS to increase in the low- to mid-single-digit range, compared to the company's prior expectation of high single-digit growth. C$0.15 per share of the lower guide was directly related to the negative impact from the work stoppage.

Current Market/Volumes Jim Foote, President and CEO at CSX Corp . (NASDAQ: CSX ) agreed with the term ""less worse"" when describing current demand. He said he hasn't seen anything to change his outlook for 2019, which was lowered from a modest revenue increase to a modest 1-2% decline during the summer. Heading into the fourth quarter of 2019, Foote thought coal would see declines of more than 10%, but those declines have accelerated recently. Through the week ended Nov. 30, CSX's coal carloads are 17.2% lower quarter-to-date but still well off the heavier declines earlier in the year (-38.3% year-to-date). Lower energy and natural gas prices are impacting utility coal while metallurgical coal is being negatively impacted by declines in the global economy, resulting in lower steel production.","CNR,CNI",en,Benzinga Feeds

This week: how the CN strike played out on SONAR; transport continues to slump in GDP data; and Bison parties down in Winnipeg. The end of the Canadian National (NYSE: CNI ) strike couldn't have come soon enough for Canada. Further disruption to the flow of goods – especially canola and wheat exports — could have been devastating to an economy whose growth is already slowing . But the eight-day disruption , which ended on Nov. 26, also showed how the freight market adjusted. The FreightWaves SONAR platform shows a fascinating story of trucking volumes slowly rising in tandem with the drop of outbound rail activity. As the volume of outbound rail containers dropped in Canada, the Outbound Tender Volume Index rose on FreightWaves' SONAR platform, suggesting that trucks were handling additional freight hit by the CN rail strike. After the strike was announced on Nov. 16, the Canadian Outbound Tender Volume Index crept upward as outbound loaded rail cars dropped, suggesting that trucks picked up some of the slack.","CNR,CNI",en,Benzinga Feeds

In Quebec, Premier François Legault warned that the province will run out of propane within days. In Alberta, the disruption hit oil-by-rail shipments — itself a temporary measure. For trucking, the strike threw a curveball at a freight market contending with excess capacity and softer volumes of freight. ""Toronto is brutal,"" Corey Darbyson, director of Transport Dsquare, a small Quebec-based carrier, wrote in a text message to FreightWaves on Nov. 21. ""I hope CN and the union rectify this soon."" At CN's Toronto-area terminal in Brampton, Ontario, trucks contended with picket lines to access curtailed intermodal operations. Sources outside CN suggested the company may be leaning on cross-trained management and other nonunionized workers.","CNR,CNI",en,Benzinga Feeds

2019-11-01 08:40:27-05:00,Commentary: The Good And Bad Of Precision Scheduled Railroading,"The railroads have been riding a bumpy track for the past several years, and for some of them it continues. FreightWaves reported on the late Hunter Harrison's methods to increase efficiency in the railroading business after he took the helm of CSX Corporation (NASDAQ: CSX ) in 2016. Harrison introduced the practices of precision scheduled railroading (PSR) that he had used successfully at the Illinois Central Railroad, Canadian National Railway (NYSE: CNI ), and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd (NYSE: CP ). Harrison's actions began to transform CSX, the nation's third-largest railroad, from a hub-and-spoke system to a more direct point-to-point system. At the time, shippers from all over the U.S., especially manufacturers and commodities producers in the middle of the country, were seeing disastrous effects on their supply chain from the implementation of new protocols. They complained about having to scrap their old schedules and spend more time loading smaller batches of cars. They bemoaned clogged networks and chronic delays.","CNR,CNI",en,Benzinga Feeds

2019-10-29 11:49:57-05:00,Commentary: Before CN Or CSX Tried PSR…,"Before the Canadian National (NYSE: CNI ) or CSX (NASDAQ: CSX ) rolled out precision scheduled railroading (PSR) under the leadership of the late E. Hunter Harrison, a much smaller terminal railroad company in the eastern United States was demonstrating aggressive cost reduction. It was Consolidated Railroad Corporation (Conrail). What Was Conrail? Actually, there were two companies named Conrail. The first was created by the U.S. Congress (the January 1974 3-R Act) as part of the federal effort to restructure the re-organizable assets of failed railroads like Penn Central. That larger network version of Conrail went into operation service on April 1, 1976. Among its cost reduction achievements were these. Original Conrail PSR-like Improvements, 1977 – 1999: Reduced work force (from about 94,000 in 1977 to about 20,000) Reduced major railroad yards from more than 250 to fewer than 50 Reduced track miles by about half (from 40,700 miles to 20,940 miles) Reduced locomotive fleet by more than 57% Eliminated a $350 million operating loss Reported positive operating income of $500 million by 1985 Improved enterprise efficiency (operating ration) from 109+ to a relatively efficient 79.9 for the 1990s era All of this was accomplished as the company resized its asset base to better serve a market demand that went down from more than 400 million annual tons of freight traffic to less than 200 million tons between about 1976 and 1981.","CNR,CNI",en,Benzinga Feeds
