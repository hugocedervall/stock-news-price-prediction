APIs are tools that link together data and features from multiple different apps to allow them to essentially ""talk"" to each other. People can make payments on DoorDash or Postmates thanks to Stripe's APIs, make calls directly from Airbnb and Yelp's apps thanks to Twilio's APIs, and get location updates on Uber thanks to Google Maps' APIs. API use has become has become so critical for companies, that there's been an outcropping of firms that specialize in building APIs specific to categories like security, payments, feature management, search, shipping, content management, databases, and more.

""Billings are a leading indicator for revenues,"" Weiss wrote in a note to clients, adding that the billings growth decline will likely lead to ""decelerating revenue growth"" next fiscal year. With annual billings growth shrinking to 17% this year from 29% in 2019 , he forecasts that revenue growth will slow from 29% in the first half of this year to 18% growth next year.

Now, RapidAPI has partnered with large companies like Microsoft and Google, and is used by over a million developers. Read more on the Business Insider homepage . The idea for the startup RapidAPI first came about from a hackathon tool to help neophyte programmers. Back in 2014, RapidAPI founder and CEO Iddo Gino had helped organize World Hackathon Day in Tel Aviv. Many of the people participating were beginners and had little experience coding. As the name suggests, a hackathon is an intensive coding event that can last hours or days, with participants teaming up to work on small projects. ""The idea behind these hackathons where to get people excited about software development or software engineering,"" Gino told Business Insider. ""A lot of them were immature in the field of programming and not coming in with a lot of experience."" Gino realized that he could give those newbies some real help by making it easier for them to use APIs , or application programming interfaces.",TWLO,en,Business Insider
