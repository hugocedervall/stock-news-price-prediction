A driver shortage has bolstered the business case for computer-operated semis, and their highway-heavy routes eliminate many of the challenges involved in spotting pedestrians and predicting how they'll move. TuSimple has focused on big rigs since it was founded in 2015, giving it a head start that CEO Cheng Lu told Business Insider has allowed it to build a lead over Waymo and other competitors. Waymo started testing its automated-driving technology in semi trucks in 2017, a spokesperson for the company said, and many of the top startups working on autonomous trucks, like Aurora Innovation and Ike, launched in the years after TuSimple closed its first funding round. ""We are the first mover in this space,"" Lu said in an interview.

This triggered a crisis of confidence and it affected NBFCs and Housing Finance Companies (HFC) in the financial sector. Banks were reeling under the NPA problem already and they had virtually stopped lending to NBFC/ HFC and real estate sector as also to many other businesses with higher risk like MSMEs and other corporates which had cash flow problems/ mismatches. Financial entities and businesses were facing problems while trying to raise loans/ capital and their cash flow problems which impacted their ability to pay back past loans.Such tightening, cashflow problems of the businesses and other issues caused some defaults like it happened with DHFL, Vodafone, Zee Group etc. Many other names have cropped up due to the subdued economic situation, the caution of the banks in view of their high NPAs and the stress they themselves were going through and the problems.

The report comments that in contrast to open-ended funds, ETFs’ shares trade in secondary markets, often on exchanges. “As a result, they offer immediate liquidity at intra-day trading prices. During the period of market stress in March, unlike in some previous stress events, investors may have found it easier to trade ETF shares than the underlying assets held by the ETF, and trading volumes in ETF shares rose significantly.” Bank of England Interim Financial Stability Report As an example, the BoE cites the largest ETFs referencing US investment-grade corporate bonds, and finds that daily trading volumes in March were more than three times their January 2020 average. The BoE writes: “In light of the relative liquidity in ETF shares compared to the corporate bond market, price discovery was often occurring via ETFs rather than their underlying assets. “During this period, ETF prices appear to have provided information about future changes in underlying asset markets, offering evidence that ETF prices incorporated new information more rapidly than the net asset values (NAV) of assets held within their, and equivalent, funds (Aramonte and Avalos (2020)).” There were some large differences between intra-day ETF prices and the measured end-of-day value of their assets.",NAV,en,etfexpress.com

The gap between the price of a fixed income ETF and its net asset value (NAV), which widens during a crisis, is the price of liquidity, the firm says. “Leading up to the coronavirus-driven market volatility, assets invested in ETFs soared, especially in fixed income products. This rapid growth raised a number of questions: chief among them how resilient ETF liquidity would be in tumultuous markets,” says Moody’s Assistant Vice President Fadi Abdel Massih. “The first quarter of 2020 has been a test of our answer: that credit ETFs track not only the performance of their underlying assets but also the liquidity of these assets.” The late February confluence of the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, deteriorating global economic outlook, vacillating oil prices, and asset price declines created a severe and extensive credit shock across many sectors, regions and markets, Moody’s writes.",NAV,en,etfexpress.com

2019-11-04 10:00:10-05:00,Diesel's Market Dominance Earns Respect But Little Love,"With diesel fuel powering 97% of all heavy-duty trucks, it seems silly to predict its industry dominance will end. But don't tell that to California. The climate-conscious state mostly ignores the fuel's significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions, preferring to press for zero emissions from all commercial vehicles by the mid-2030s. An electric future in which batteries and hydrogen replace diesel is a captivating idea. German truck maker Daimler AG, including its market-leading North American unit, said Oct. 25 it is targeting 2039 to sell only battery- and hydrogen-powered fuel cell electric trucks in its key markets. At last week's biannual North American Commercial Vehicle Show in Atlanta, three Class 8 hydrogen fuel-cell prototype trucks from Hyundai Motor, Nikola Motors and engine-maker Cummins Inc. drew consistent crowds of curious onlookers on the exhibit floor. Tomorrowland Battery electric concepts covered chunks of real estate in numerous displays. Navistar International Corp . (NYSE: NAV ) showed its production-intent medium-duty eMV truck for the first time.",NAV,en,Benzinga Feeds
2019-10-31 09:32:01-05:00,Navistar Skips Incentive Chase To Get Electric Trucks To Diesel Price Parity,"Navistar International Corp . (NYSE: NAV ) is skipping the chase for incentives on demonstration electric trucks to consult with customers on custom-built zero-emission medium-duty models with a total cost of ownership rivaling a diesel truck. ""We're in this for the long haul,"" said Jason Gies, director of Navistar's eMobility business development. ""We're not just chasing grant money in the short-term. Our goal is to electrify everything that makes sense."" That does not mean the company will not partake of incentives offered through the California Air Resources Board (CARB). The CARB-backed Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project provides vouchers of up to $220,000 for California purchasers and lessees of battery-electric trucks and buses. Navistar's competitors are at various stages of launching electric truck demonstration fleets in California. The programs are partially paid for by CARB and other agencies pursuing the state's goal of having only zero-emission trucks on its roads by the mid-2030s. ""We've seen it with other technologies,"" said Persio Lisboa, Navistar chief operating officer. ""When grant …",NAV,en,Benzinga Feeds
2019-10-29 09:35:15-05:00,Navistar Expands TRATON Partnership With Canadian Mining Deal,"Navistar International Corp . (NYSE: NAV ) will sell mining trucks from Scania Group through a few dealerships in Canada in the first product-sharing deal with its global alliance partner TRATON Group. The memorandum of understanding announced at the North American Commercial Vehicles Show in Atlanta on October 28 is significant because it opens the door to TRATON, the holding company for Volkswagen AG's truck group, to sell products in North America. Navistar kept exclusive access to the U.S. and Canadian markets when it agreed to sell 16.8% of the company to the former Volkswagen Truck Group for $256 million in 2016. TRATON CEO Andreas Renschler said in July the company has no interest in a bigger equity stake in Navistar even as the alliance expands beyond purchasing and powertrain … Full story available on Benzinga.com",NAV,en,Benzinga Feeds

2019-03-06 21:45:00-05:00,Trucking Boom U-Turns,"Authored by Wolf Richter via WolfStreet.com, Another Gauge of the Goods-Based Economy Heads South. Orders for Class-8 trucks – made by Daimler (Freightliner, Western Star), Paccar (Peterbuilt, Kenworth), Navistar International, and Volvo Group (Mack Trucks, Volvo Trucks) – plunged 58% in February compared to February last year, to 16,700 orders, according to FTR Transportation Intelligence after they’d already plunged 58% year-over-year in January and 43% in December. The orders in January and February were back in the range of the “transportation recession” that had hit the industry in 2015 and 2016. At the time, truck and engine manufacturers reacted with layoffs. But for now, they’re sitting on a massive backlog from the boom in orders last year (data via FTR): The business is infamously cyclical, with regular booms that lead to over-ordering and then overcapacity, followed by busts that then sort it all out again. The industry is also seasonal, so we can use year-over-year comparisons to eliminate most of the effects of seasonality.",NAV,en,Zero Hedge
