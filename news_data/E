But experts suggest that you shouldn't expect the market-leading cloud provider to go all-in on a so-called multicloud strategy any time soon. On Tuesday, AWS announced a pair of new products called ECS Anywhere and EKS Anywhere at its annual re:Invent conference . ECS, or Elastic Container Service, allows customers to easily run and manage containers on Amazon's cloud. Containers allow developers to easily package up code so that their applications can run in different computing environments. And EKS, or Elastic Kubernetes Service, allows customers to run the open source cloud computing project Kubernetes on Amazon's cloud, making it easy to manage containers and run large-scale applications. As the names suggest, ECS Anywhere and EKS Anywhere allow users to deploy those services just about anywhere — from private data centers to a miniature Raspberry Pi computer, as long as it has internet access and a connection to AWS, they can be downloaded and run.",E,en,Business Insider

That investment was first reported by Reuters Friday, without naming the investors who participated. It brings Form Energy's total funds raised to around $120 million, a hefty sum for a novel technology that's still a few years away from its first commercial deployment. Lithium-ion batteries dominate nearly all the grid storage getting installed today, but that technology's cost effectiveness wanes for storing energy for many hours or days. Entrepreneurs have pursued a motley crew of alternatives to turn wind and solar power into baseload power plants: things like flow batteries of various chemistries, gravity-based systems that mimic pumped hydro storage, and compressed air in caverns or tanks. But the long duration storage sector has produced more bankruptcies and delays than sure-fire successes. See GTM's previous coverage: So, what exactly is long duration energy storage?

2020-10-08 18:01:53-05:00,Stranded assets: Report warns US oil majors are lagging European rivals in clean energy transition,"Latest study from Carbon Tracker shows that while US firms are particularly exposed, all oil and gas firms would face massive stranded asset risk in the event of a successful energy transition US companies are lagging way behind their European rivals in adapting their business models to a low-carbon future which would see demand for fossil fuels drastically reduced, a new study released today by Carbon Tracker demonstrates. But while some oil and gas companies are far less prepared for the clean energy transition than others, all of the world's biggest oil majors are operating with project portfolios that expose them to massive stranded asset risk, the report argues. Titled Fault Lines: How diverging oil and gas company strategies link to stranded asset risk , the study warns that fossil fuel demand would have to plummet to meet agreed climate targets and, consequently, only the lowest cost oil projects would deliver reliable returns. Reiterating many of its previous studies, the think tank warns that most of the world's oil majors are continuing to approve investments in projects that are inconsistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement.",E,en,BusinessGreen

With national economies suffering from revenue shortages, and populations in need of additional government support to mitigate the impacts of the crisis, SWFs have in many cases seen their roles transformed. As a result of reduced income, many governments have been tapping SWFs to help balance budgets and provide stimulus to businesses or households. This development has changed the conventional wisdom surrounding SWFs, which have combined assets estimated of around $6trn globally. Before the pandemic the funds were seen as having limited – or a total lack of – liabilities.

ENI is not the only company to have announced an asset divestment plan following significant oil price reductions, reduced global oil and gas demand due to COVID-19 and rising stakeholder pressure to decarbonize portfolios. This announcement coincides with ENI's 2020 CAPEX reduction of ~35% (relative to the initial budget), the July 2020 downward revision of the company's post-2023 Brent oil price assumption (from $70/bbl to $60/bbl) and ENI's continued commitment to the energy transition. In order to achieve more agile, lower carbon, advantage barrels the company will need to increase the efficiency of their oil production operations and minimise gas flaring, whilst re-focusing on lower carbon energy sources, including gas monetisation. The presence of large volumes of gas with limited commercialisations options is a challenge to ENI's operated Congolese portfolio, potentially increasing the carbon intensity of the portfolio if increased gas flaring is required.",E,en,IHS Markit

Instead, <span/> the global offshore rig market once again finds itself in a downturn. However, given the short, <span/> slow recovery that was underway before March, the industry has had little time to build itself back up. We are now in the second half of the year, and much of the world is still at least partly shut down because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The numbers of positive cases and hospitalisations continue to rise in some countries and it is looking like the virus will keep people in many nations at home much, if not all, of this year, further depressing demand for crude oil and natural gas products. <span/> At this point, most of the work that was expected to be awarded for 2020 starts has been pushed into 2021 at the earliest. <span/> Given the unprecedented uncertainty of this downturn, which combines an oil price crash and a global pandemic, near-term predictions are riddled with caveats as a similar situation has never arisen.",E,en,IHS Markit

From SputnikNews last week comes this note about the Farzad-B oil and gas field and Iran.

Visit INSIDER's homepage for more stories . The world's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier — the USS Enterprise — is being harvested for parts for other US Navy flattops. The Enterprise waged war from Vietnam to Afghanistan during its 51 years of service.

2019-04-22 21:44:49-05:00,"Reliance Jio may hike prices to meet Rs 9,000 cr annual spend on capacity lease deals","Kolkata: Reliance Jio Infocomm may be pushed to raise prices in this financial year as it needs to spend about Rs 9,000 crore a year on its long-term capacity leasing deals with special purpose vehicles (SPVs) created to hold its demerged fibre and towers assets, coupled with the capital raising plans of rivals Vodafone Idea (VIL) and Bharti Airtel, said analysts.“The likelihood of Jio raising prices is higher today than it was six to nine months ago, which has positive implications for incumbent peers, particularly, Vodafone Idea,” JP Morgan said in a note to clients seen by ET. The US brokerage said investors increasingly believe Vodafone Idea and Airtel’s capital raising plans, signalling their capacity to fight, may prompt Jio to rethink its pricing stance, especially on whether it can afford to keep expanding its balance sheet investments for the next two three years.VIL and Airtel plan to raise about Rs 25,000 crore each through rights issues to boost their countrywide 4G push to effectively battle Jio.Jio’s management, however, reiterated at its post-results analyst call last week that the telecom operator would not tweak tariffs and would continue to focus on gaining subscriber market share.The company’s pricing aggression since its entry in September 2016 forced incumbents to match rates to retain customers, galvanising consumption of voice and data services.",E,en,The Economic Times India
