Until very recently, the notion that the world could quickly develop and mass produce a vaccine for some new infectious disease within a matter of months seemed impossible. Of course, these aren't normal times. After unveiling the adenovirus-vector vaccine developed by the Gameleya Institute, Russian President Putin claimed that the vaccine was tested first on a small group of willing participants, including one of his own adult daughters.

The therapy involves treating sick patients with the blood of those who have already recovered. Convalescent plasma is also the basis for a drug, hyperimmune globulin, which would deliver consistent antibody levels to patients. But researchers still need to prove that the treatments are safe. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . During the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, doctors discovered they could treat sick patients with the blood of those who had already recovered. The therapy, known as convalescent plasma, helped reduce mortality among people with acute infections. Now, it's showing promise as a treatment for COVID-19. That's because many people who get the coronavirus develop neutralizing antibodies — our body's natural response to a foreign pathogen.
