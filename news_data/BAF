Indian banks are gaining at the expense of mid-size and small non-bank lenders as far as fresh home loan mortgages are concerned.While most large banks like State Bank of India, ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank relied on home loans to post strong retail growth in the September quarter, non-bank lenders such as PNB Housing Finance, L&T Finance and LIC Housing Finance saw mortgage loan growth contract over last year. Mortgage market leader Housing Development Finance Corp, however, continued to post growth.Industry watchers said despite the presence of more first-time homebuyers in the market than a year earlier, most large banks grew their books by luring NBFC clients to transfer their existing home loans to them with record low interest rates.“There are a lot of balance transfer cases that are happening because the larger lenders with comfortable liquidity are able to offer low interest rates, so over the next six months all the large lenders will get back to their pre-Covid volumes even if the overall housing market does not recover,” said Mahesh Misra, the chief executive of India Mortgage Guarantee Company which guarantees home loans for SBI, HDFC, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank among others.79380244Mortgage loan sales have also been aided by low levels of interest rates and concessions offered by lenders to entice homebuyers.",BAF,en,Economic Times India

It may decline further by 8 per cent to near Rs 3,000 levels soon, said analysts.Open interest in Bajaj Finance futures at the beginning of October series was at a three-year low because of the unwinding of long positions, said Motilal Oswal’s technical and derivatives analyst Jay Purohit. “We may see the stock falling to Rs 3,050-Rs 3,100 in the ongoing series. We see a strong hurdle at 3,500 for the stock,” said Purohit.The company in its business update reported a growth of 1.3 per cent year-on-year in its assets under management (AUM) which, according to analysts, was muted.“…company performance in the near-term will be muted because of the nature of its loan mix which will be highly weighed upon by the lockdown situation.

On Vedanta delistingI do not belong to the camp that says that the delisting price will be somewhere around Rs 175-190. It is very clear even from the current book that has been built that most of the medium price at which the shares have been tendered is somewhere around Rs 138 which was the price until yesterday. Today the stock collapsed and we see going forward, Vedanta will continue to receive a promoter-led discount to its share price. A lot of people say that it is trading below book value. It is trading below the book value because a promoter-led discount is being offered to the stock. So, the median price at which the bids have been coming in are at Rs 138 which was the price virtually as of yesterday. Two, it is unlikely that the management will accept this price because at Rs 138, they have to shell out close to Rs 2,0000 crore.",BAF,en,Economic Times India

Where do you sense big opportunities within the IT universe?IT actually has a big broad sort of horizon at this moment and everything which feeds into it -- the enabling ecosystem of telecom, fibre etc are big beneficiaries. It is really about everyone who facilitates gathering large amounts of data whether it is the Internet of Things (IoT) which gathers data from objects or whether it is the industry, the cell phone industry, the variable industry which gathers data about people, the cloud which helps store data securely. Then comes the layer of artificial intelligence which actually exploits that data, gets insights and takes us forward. Covid is on everybody’s top of mind and there is a lot of data floating around. However brilliant people are, no one could actually figure out what it was all about, till a gentlemen called Dr Jacobson in Tennessee who runs the a Oak Ridge National Laboratory which has one of the fastest supercomputers in the world, took 17,000 samples and fed it into the computer putting it in a self learning algorithm and came out with the hypothesis that this is something like a Bradykinin storm which is completely different from what everybody felt it was.",BAF,en,Economic Times India

Also a lot of approvals which were pending for the last six to 12 months have been cleared. Pharma is a very stock specific story. Different companies have different ANDAs, different product pipelines, different chemistries. It should be looked at from that point of view.

According to a report by Marcellus Investment Advisors, the annual churn in the BSE 500 Index is as high as 12 per cent per annum which means that 60 new companies become part of the Index every year, replacing 60 incumbents. This high churn ratio signifies that most existing incumbents are unable to sustain their place in the index and, over the course of time, make way for more deserving candidates. The report said that if one were to look at BSE 500 as it stood in December 2009, out of the total 500 member stocks then, only 274 stocks continue to remain in the index. In other words, nearly 45 per cent of the stocks have exited the index over the last ten years. On their way out, most of these stocks saw significant erosion in their shareholders' wealth (on an average, the companies which exited the index have lost 40 per cent of their December 2009 market cap).",BAF,en,Sify.com

2020-04-26 17:40:43-05:00,Huge provisioning at NBFCs likely for Jan-Feb bad loans,"MUMBAI: Non-bank lenders and housing finance corporations such as HDFC, Shriram Group, Bajaj Finance may have to provide more than what has been mandated by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on loan accounts behind on payments in January and February. Auditors and company executives told ET that higher provisioning may be necessary as the pandemic-induced sharp dip would have increased difficulties for these businesses already hit by the ongoing slowdown. In many cases, auditors have asked companies to provide up to 50%.This will, however, apply only to loan accounts that had fallen behind on payments in January-February, and not to delayed or non-payment of loans in the moratorium period of March-May. RBI had asked lenders to provide up to 10% for bad loans in this period — 5% split up in January-March and April-June. NBFCs follow Indian Accounting Standards (Ind-AS) and will have to provide for all potential bad loans even if the amount is above what is prescribed. Auditors are required to take a judgement call on each portfolio even if the borrower is not a defaulter, and decide how much has to be provisioned.Some industry leaders welcomed the move as better in the long term. “While this will lead to additional provision impact, we believe this is a prudent move considering the overall economic scenario,” said Ravi Subramanian, managing director, Shriram Housing Finance. “This move by the regulator is guiding NBFCs and HFCs to be more careful on accounts which were at verge of becoming substandard.”75397834Auditors say the impact will be visible at end of FY20 as well as the June quarter.",BAF,en,Economic Times India

2020-03-13 00:00:45-05:00,Bank seizure kills hope for shadow bank revival,"By Suvashree Ghosh, Rahul Satija and Divya PatilIndia’s decision to seize control of its fourth-largest private bank at a time when the coronavirus is roiling markets risks prolonging a credit crunch among the nation’s non-traditional financiers.The Yes Bank Ltd. takeover last week marked the first instance of a large bank falling prey to contagion from the shadow-lender crisis that policy makers have struggled to contain for 18 months.Yes Bank’s collapse now threatens to sharpen the division between the weak and strong in India’s financial system - many are cash-starved while a healthy few raise money at rates predating the onset of the crisis. The fresh shock to funding markets will extend the struggle of second- and third-tier institutions and delay a lending recovery that’s badly needed as economic growth slumps toward an 11-year low. At their height, shadow banks accounted for about a third of new loans sanctioned.“Some of the large shadow banks are back to lending,” said Madhavi Arora, an economist at Edelweiss Securities Ltd. in Mumbai. “However, it is a long way to go before the shadow banking sector revives and gets back to full-fledged lending.”Yes Bank was brought down by its exposure to non-bank lenders and developers - both caught up in the funding crunch that’s persisted since late 2018.",BAF,en,The Economic Times India

2020-03-02 21:36:20-05:00,SBI Card IPO: HNIs may have to pay extra for borrowed funds,"Non-bank lenders are raising cash so that high-networth individuals (HNIs) seeking to buy into one of India’s biggest initial share sales can bid aggressively. But they may have to pay more – perhaps 15 per cent by way of interest – to deploy borrowed funds into the ongoing IPO of SBI Cards.Domestic institutions have issued commercial papers (CP) worth more than Rs 80,000 crore to fund SBI Cards and Payments Services IPO at an interest rate of 11-13 per cent. That means HNIs will have to pay interest in the range 13-15 per cent since there is a mark-up over and above the cost of raising funds at local institutions.Funding costs have climbed due to the ongoing equity-markets crisis following the spread of the Covid-19 epidemic around the world. While HNIs make money from the listing premium, the lenders will make a neat profit with 2-3 per cent spread, according to market participants. The grey market premium for the SBI Cards IPO, however, fell to Rs 180 on Monday from a high of Rs 380 last week.Bajaj Finance, Kotak Mahindra Capital, JM Financial, IIFL Wealth Finance, Edelweiss Finance, ECL Finance, Aditya Birla Finance and Sharekhan BNP Paribas are among the firms raising nearly Rs 75,000 crore by issuing commercial papers maturing in 9-14 days.",BAF,en,The Economic Times India

What we are staring at is a lot of strength, record highs and good market breadth.

It was a great surprise because there were a lot of nice and refreshing aspects to the policy compared to the dogmas of the past. It may have its own risk and I acknowledge that but at least it is a path forward to doing something different. Number two alludes to the budget. Let us be honest, the budget had nothing great about it. Since the stock market and economy are so linked together, the market is being driven by global flows or at least local flows. Then thirdly, this whole thing about the value in midcaps has been built up to a crescendo at this point in time.

Sixteen months later, what we have here is the failure of just two shadow banks and several others turning smaller, rather than a full-blown crisis that would have warranted a bail-out funded by taxpayers.IL&FS’ balance sheet of nearly Rs 1 lakh crore created such a scare that almost everyone in the industry said that nothing short of a bail-out plan or a special liquidity window could save the Non-Banking Finance Companies and that the failure of NBFCs could lead to a domino effect.While industry was in panic, the Reserve Bank of India and the government stood on the sidelines and watched the re-adjustment in the financial markets play out, rather than coming to the rescue of firms that were facing difficulties in raising funds to roll over their commitments.Many have cricitised the RBI’s reluctance to open a special window, but the central bank did open the liquidity spigot that turned a system liquidity deficit into one of surplus at Rs 52,500 crore between April-December.",BAF,en,The Economic Times India

The broader market is still reeling under pressure with both Mid Cap and Small Cap indices showing negative returns in this calendar year to date, in sharp contrast to the 50-scrip Nifty index delivering double-digit returns.

So while India has done well, up say 5-6%, over the same period EM has actually done even better. I would just say that a large part of what is happening in India is EM flow driven. In India this year to date, FII flows are $12 billion.

In the Multi-cap fund category, IIFL Focused Fund has delivered 27.65 per cent in a year, while ICICI Focused returned 0.5 per cent.Higher volatility in the markets has led to a set of blue chips performing better than the rest. Those funds which have managed to hold these blue chips have managed to do well. Others like Axis Bluechip have done well because of high cash holdings.

2019-11-03 12:12:52-05:00,Why it’s downright dangerous to equate banks and NBFCs,"By Mythili BhusnurmathLast month, a business daily declared Bajaj Finserv MD-CEO Sanjiv Bajaj ‘Banker of the Year’. Few will dispute the Bajaj scion’s Midas touch, or contest his selection. Except that Bajaj is not a banker. And his company, Bajaj Finserv, the holding company of Bajaj Finance, is not a bank, but a non-banking finance company (NBFC).But if no heads seemed to turn at the announcement, the reason is simple. The line between banks and NBFCs, always a fine one, has blurred to a point where few see a contradiction in a ‘non-banker’ being declared ‘Banker of the Year’.A Bank by Any Other NameThe confusion is understandable. Newspaper editorials often equate deposits in banks and NBFCs. A recent piece in ET (‘The Unsafe Vaults: With the Financial System Hit by Defaults, Is It Time to Resurrect an Old Law?’, bit.do/ffQeu) says, “At the peak of the global financial crisis, Ireland had to publicly declare its promise to repay every single bank depositor to prevent arun on the banking industry that would have shattered its economy.” It then goes on to describe how depositors have not been repaid by NBFCs like Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS), Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL), Altico Capital and Punjab & Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank, overlooking the subtle, but key, difference between banks and non-banks.",BAF,en,The Economic Times India

There is clearly some doubt in terms of the relationship between the asset classes. We try to correlate the GDP numbers with tax numbers which are coming. Right now, the problem in case of India is that we have gone through a large cycle every year but growth never seems to come about. The situation especially in the last couple of weeks seems to reflect the mindset that the government may not be aggressively looking at relieving the short-term pain, not only in the NBFC sector but even on the manufacturing and other sectors.On the mining side, we have been importing a lot of natural resources which typically have one of the largest reserves.",BAF,en,The Economic Times India

Typically, such debt has a markup or spread of 200-300 basis points over the dollar-linked London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor), dealers said, citing past deals. However, global investors have turned risk averse with many countries yielding less than zero for their benchmark bonds, said an investment banker.“Under the current circumstances, any Indian company with a fair share of builder loans has to walk the extra mile to raise overseas credit,” the person said.69935776 Piramal Capital didn’t respond to queries.The company is struggling due to the current cash crunch in the real estate sector because of its heavy builder loans.",BAF,en,The Economic Times India

Edited excerpts: It has been good for India in the last 45 days. You cannot find a fault line. But is this as good as it gets?For Sensex, 45,000 is a reasonable one-year forward target and that gives much more upside than we have for global emerging markets. So, a double digit upside more or less, whereas we have only 2% or 3% upside for global emerging markets. There is a number of things that India is going through. Obviously this government has come in for the second term. We have got an interest rate cutting cycle underway and we have got the oil price falling which is always helpful. I think the banking sector issues attract a lot of attention but we are getting closer to resolution on those and if that happens, we should hopefully start to see growth picking up which is a very important opportunity.",BAF,en,The Economic Times India

Adherence to such prudential norms should further reduce the impact on margins at these lenders.“In practice, most large NBFCs have already started maintaining a liquidity buffer since the liquidity crunch started in September 2018,” IDFC Securities said in a report. “Liquid assets included in the buffer may not exactly match RBI requirements but can be easily converted to meet the requirements – for instance liquid mutual funds not specifically mentioned as high quality liquid assets by RBI can be converted to g-secs without haircuts.",BAF,en,The Economic Times India
