The company’s circular tower concept can have up to 12 floors, each containing a central VAWT, allowing for much greater energy production per unit of area than would be possible with a single turbine. As well as increasing total rated power, the company says the upper floors of its Odin towers can access higher wind speeds and thus deliver up to four times the average electricity production of a ground-mounted turbine. Test documents seen by GTM show a prototype tower achieved a 62 percent increase in power efficiency compared to a standalone turbine, based on an average 16.5 percent increase in wind speed. A video of the prototype Odin tower, built in 2011 on Jeju Island, South Korea, and tested by the Korea Testing & Research Institute and the Jeju Energy Corporation between 2015 and 2017, also shows the concept is almost silent in operation, making it suitable for urban environments.",LAZ,en,Green Technology Media

2020-07-23 18:01:55-05:00,Nuclear power: still 'no thanks' in 2020?,"Peter Michaelis, head of Liontrust's Sustainable Investment Team, considers whether new nuclear power is a worthwhile investment in the race to net zero Nearly 10 years ago, we looked at nuclear power to assess whether we should expect a surge in new plants to satisfy demand for clean, CO2-free electricity - and concluded it was very unlikely. This was based on the fact that while nuclear fission power has very low CO2 emissions, there are other issues that counteract this benefit, and the past decade has shown our prediction to be correct. In the intervening years, however, there have been three developments. First, the need to decarbonise has become more urgent; second, the cost of solar and wind has substantially decreased; and, third, new nuclear technologies have developed. In light of these, we have re-examined the case to question whether the 2020s will be a decade of nuclear renaissance and whether it can be part of the solution to decarbonise electricity. From the 1970s, nuclear's share of global electricity generation rose to 18 per cent in the late 1990s before falling to 10 per cent today.",LAZ,en,BusinessGreen
