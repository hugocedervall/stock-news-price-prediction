As digital channels become a more critical part of the overall banking journey, banks' design teams need to strategize on how best to create user experiences (UX) that resonate with their customers.

One of the most common misconceptions among healthcare IT teams is that the cloud service provider is solely responsible for perimeter security. This couldn’t be further from the truth. The Washington Post reports that “easy remote access has helped transform companies’ computer systems from electronic fortresses to entities more like coffee shops with people and services streaming to and fro.” Some big names have made this costly mistake. Capital One, a major advocate for the cloud, looked to their provider AWS for security. However, in 2019 they unknowingly became victim to one of the largest data breaches ever, resulting in 140,000 stolen social security numbers and 80,000 bank accounts after their own firewall had been breached.

But despite all the enthusiasm over cloud computing , the reality is many firms still operate brick-and-mortar data storage facilities . There are many reasons for this , including concerns over security, the cost associated with the transition, and the lack of a playbook on how to manage what can be a difficult transformation. The latter, however, is quickly changing. Capital One recently exited its last physical data center, Business Insider can exclusively reveal, becoming the first US bank to be all-in on the public cloud, and joining Netflix as one of the few major corporations to earn the distinction. It was a journey that the $40 billion financial titan began in 2014 when it partnered with Amazon Web Services . While other financial giants have either moved more slowly or preferred a hybrid approach of maintaining some of their own infrastructure, Capital One believes that transitioning completely will enable it to more quickly release new products, easily scale-up capabilities depending on usage, and reduce failure rates, among other advantages, according to vice president of technology Melanie Frank. ""A cloud-native application looks very different and to truly take advantage of those capabilities you really need modern applications and modern architecture,"" she told Business Insider.

2020-10-30 14:32:00-05:00,The 6 best credit cards for bad credit in November 2020,"Summary List Placement Having a low credit score makes it harder to get approved for a new credit card and other types of loans, and it means that when you do get approved for, say, a mortgage, you'll generally get less-favorable terms like the highest variable interest rates. A bad credit score is defined as anything below 580, according to the FICO scoring model, and anything below 601 according to VantageScore. If you currently find yourself in this credit score range, you probably won't get approved for popular rewards cards like the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card , but you do have some credit card options. Secured credit cards are particularly easy to get approved for, because you put up a cash deposit as collateral to get started, and there are also non-secured cards tailored to those looking to repair or build their credit. Using a card responsibly will help boost your credit over time, since keeping your credit utilization low and making on-time payments are the two biggest factors that determine your credit score .",COF,en,Business Insider

2020-05-21 10:36:00-05:00,The 6 best credit cards for bad credit in May 2020,"Having a low credit score makes it harder to get approved for a new credit card and other types of loans, and it means that when you do get approved for, say, a mortgage, you'll generally get less-favorable terms like the highest variable interest rates. A bad credit score is defined as anything below 580, according to the FICO scoring model, and anything below 601 according to VantageScore. If you currently find yourself in this credit score range, you probably won't get approved for popular rewards cards like the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card , but you do have some credit card options. Secured credit cards are particularly easy to get approved for, because you put up a cash deposit as collateral to get started, and there are also non-secured cards tailored to those looking to repair or build their credit. Using a card responsibly will help boost your credit over time, since keeping your credit utilization low and making on-time payments are the two biggest factors that determine your credit score .",COF,en,Business Insider

If you simply stop paying your bills without talking to your bank, it may report your payments as late or missed, which would harm your credit. A credit card with an introductory APR offer could be a good alternative to credit card forbearance, but note that it could be difficult to get approved for a card if you've lost your source of income and your credit score isn't extremely high.

Because at a time when the American consumer is already leveraged to the hilt, and when credit data suggests some are finally biting the bullet and curbing spending to pay it down, lenders have hit on a novel strategy to boost growth. And that strategy is, according to Bloomberg , raising certain borrowers' credit limits without a request from the borrower.

2019-04-25 15:07:10-05:00,"Credit card companies like Barclays, AmEx, and Capital One are making it easier than ever to deal with a lost or stolen card","Business Insider may receive a commission from The Points Guy Affiliate Network if you apply for a credit card, but our reporting and recommendations are always independent and objective. If you lose your credit card, or if it's stolen, it's traditionally been a hassle to resolve. However, credit card companies have introduced features through websites and mobile apps to give consumers more options, and more control, than ever. Card issuers like Barclays, which issues the Barclaycard Arrival Plus World Elite Mastercard , and AmEx, which issues the Platinum Card® from American Express and the American Express® Gold Card , have gotten on board with the changes. Credit cards are an incredibly secure and convenient form of payment, but they aren't without their hassles. One of my biggest problems is that I regularly forget my card at restaurants, especially when the card is a dark color that seem to disappear on the folio. When this happened in the past, you were often told to cancel your misplaced card and have it replaced.",COF,en,Business Insider

2019-04-18 16:15:00-05:00,The best cash-back credit cards of 2019,"Business Insider may receive a commission from The Points Guy Affiliate Network if you apply for a credit card, but our reporting and recommendations are always independent and objective. Cash-back cards are the most popular rewards credit cards, according to a recent study. While it's possible to get more value from travel rewards cards , cash back is simpler, more flexible, and often easier. Like most rewards credit cards , cash-back cards work by giving you a portion of the processing fee that the issuer gets from the merchant for each transaction. While some cards offer a consistent 1.5–2% cash-back rate on purchases, you may be better off with a card that offers higher amounts back in bonus categories, or large new membership bonuses. Similarly, you might actually earn more from a card with an annual fee than a no-annual-fee option. These are the best cash back credit cards currently available, from Chase, Citi, Wells Fargo, Capital One, and American Express. When you're looking to earn credit card rewards, the type of rewards you go for, beyond just the specific card you open, can make a big difference in how much value you get.",COF,en,Business Insider
