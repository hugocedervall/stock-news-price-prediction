One is simple: It's been a long time since the market's worst stocks looked this bad compared to the rest.

The coronavirus pandemic has been a watershed moment for telehealth — or the use of mobile technology to deliver health-related services, such as remote doctor consultations and patient monitoring — as patients have had to reimagine the ways they seek healthcare. While telehealth has been on the brink of taking off for years, consumer usage of the tech ticked up slowly before 2020. The coronavirus pandemic has given consumers the push they need to adopt telemedicine on a wide scale — and we expect adoption to keep climbing so long as the pandemic rages on. Once outbreaks became severe in the US, consumers began flocking to telehealth: Telehealth usage among US adults climbed 6 percentage points month-over-month from February 2020 — when 11% of respondents reported having tried telehealth — to March — when 17% said the same, per a survey by CivicScience.","TDOC,BOE",en,Business Insider

Boeing's plane had been grounded around the world since March 2019, after the second of two 737 aircrafts crashed, with a combined death toll of 346. Boeing was left facing lawsuits from families, shareholders, and airlines — plunging it into the biggest crisis in its history and leaving planes sitting idle around the world. The US Federal Aviation Administration announced on Wednesday — 20 months after the plane was grounded — that the 737 Max is allowed to fly again following upgrades and fixes, after a far longer process than Boeing expected. The plane's return is good news for the company, but reopens wounds for those who lost loved ones in the crashes. Business Insider spoke to two parents who lost their daughters in the second crash, over Ethiopia. They believe the plane is not safe enough to return — despite approval from regulators like the FAA — and find celebration over its return deeply painful.",BOE,en,Business Insider

Bridenstine, a Republican, represented Oklahoma's 1st Congressional District before President Donald Trump appointed him to NASA's top position.

Rather, Bridenstine said, he would do so to ensure that the next leader of the agency could be someone with a longer-term relationship to Biden. ""The right question here is, 'What's in the best interest of NASA as an agency, and what's in the best interest of America's exploration program?'"" Bridenstine told Aviation Week. ""For that, what you need is somebody who has a close relationship with the president of the United States. You need somebody who is trusted by the administration. ""I think that I would not be the right person for that in a new administration,"" he added.

The New York-based asset manager, which has USD356 billion in assets under management, says it plans to give advance notice of how the firm will vote on over 100 proposals at shareholder meetings, between April and June 2021. In 2020, a pilot of the same scheme saw Neuberger Berman disclose 29 votes at companies including Facebook, Netflix, and Royal Dutch Shell. Speaking to Institutional Asset Manager, Neuberger Berman’s head of ESG investing, Jonathan Bailey, says that there is currently an “insufficient level of transparency” around asset managers’ votes on company proposals. “Proxy votes do have value,” says Bailey, adding that steps like pre-announcing votes allows the industry to show it is “moving in a better direction”.",BOE,en,InstitutionAlassetManager

This week, a winning entry to a competition organized by the United States Department of Defense cast both these aspects in a new light. To keep pace with the ever-more technologized battlelines of contemporary warfare, the DoD continues to explore ways to innovate the manufacturing process and supply chain for weaponry and infrastructure in use by the Air Force and avy. The Advanced Manufacturing Olympics, held virtually this year on Oct. 20–23, sought to recruit traditional DoD contractors, technology developers, and academics to mobilize new technologies, particularly 3D printing, for the manufacture and delivery of critical parts in the military supply chain. SIMBA Chain, a smart contract-as-a-service platform developed the University of Notre Dame and ITAMCO, was awarded first place and a prize of $100,000 for its entry in one of the technical challenges set during the DoD's olympics.",BOE,en,Cointelegraph

Este descubrimiento indica que el agua se puede distribuir por la superficie lunar, y no se limita a lugares fríos y sombreados. SOFIA ha detectado moléculas de agua (H2O) en el cráter Clavius, uno de los cráteres más grandes visibles desde la Tierra, ubicado en el hemisferio sur de la Luna. Las observaciones anteriores de la superficie de la Luna detectaron alguna forma de hidrógeno, pero no pudieron distinguir entre el agua y su pariente químico cercano, el hidroxilo (OH). Los datos de esta ubicación revelan agua en concentraciones de 100 a 412 partes por millón, aproximadamente equivalente a una botella de agua de un tercio de litro, atrapada en un metro cúbico de suelo esparcido por la superficie lunar. Los resultados se publican en el último número de Nature Astronomy. “Teníamos indicios de que H2O, el agua familiar que conocemos, podría estar presente en el lado iluminado por el sol de la Luna”, dijo Paul Hertz, director de la División de Astrofísica en la Dirección de Misiones Científicas en la Sede de la NASA en Washington. “Ahora sabemos que está ahí.",BOE,es,Gaceta de Salamanca

Subscribe today to receive industry-changing health news and analysis to your inbox. The coronavirus pandemic has been a watershed moment for telehealth — or the use of mobile technology to deliver health-related services, such as remote doctor consultations and patient monitoring — as patients have had to reimagine the ways they seek healthcare. While telehealth has been on the brink of taking off for years, consumer usage of the tech ticked up slowly before 2020. The coronavirus pandemic has given consumers the push they need to adopt telemedicine on a wide scale — and we expect adoption to keep climbing so long as the pandemic rages on. Once outbreaks became severe in the US, consumers began flocking to telehealth: Telehealth usage among US adults climbed 6 percentage points month-over-month from February 2020 — when 11% of respondents reported having tried telehealth — to March — when 17% said the same, per a survey by CivicScience.","BMY,BOE",en,Business Insider

These initiatives will continue till normal operations resume,” said an Air India official, who did not wish to be identified.Officials said Air India managed to reduce its salary bill drastically through up to 15% pay cuts of employees, reduction in flying allowance to pilots and removal of people on contract after retirement.“Pilots’ salaries were fixed at 70 hours of flying earlier, which has now been reduced to 20 hours. Since there are limited international flights, the airline does not have to pay layover allowance to cockpit and cabin crew. On top of it, the airline has let go of about 250 people, who were retired but were serving on contract,” said the official.When contacted, Air India confirmed the move and said it has been able to “save a good amount on its wage bill from Rs 229.75 crore in April to Rs 120 crore in September”.Besides these initiatives, Air India provided an option to employees to go on leave without pay but that did not find many takers.As the government plans to sell Air India, the carrier has been trying to reduce its costs.",BOE,en,Economic Times India

The trip is the last of the seats that NASA will have to lease from Russia now that its own commercial crew program has matured. NASA's next U.S. launch is scheduled for early-to-mid November. NASA's Commercial Crew program finally produced real, tangible results when SpaceX's Crew Dragon carried a pair of astronauts to the International Space Station earlier this year. It was a very big deal for NASA, and the first time the space agency had launched a crewed mission from U.S. soil in almost a decade. NASA wants to be able to launch crewed missions whenever it wants, and it simply couldn't do that by leasing seats aboard Russian Soyuz rockets. So, the fact that NASA astronaut Kate Rubins just rode a Russian spacecraft to the orbiting laboratory certainly seems odd, but it's actually been planned for quite some time. NASA had hoped to have its commercial crew partners and their spacecraft ready for use much earlier than 2020, and when it became clear that both SpaceX and Boeing were running behind schedule they scrambled to secure seats aboard Russian space vehicles to ensure a continued U.S. presence on the space station.",BOE,en,BGR

After initially promising a tit-for-tat rebuttal within the day , the company, presumably on the advice of well-heeled counsel, released a full response on Monday to Hindenburg Research's allegations of lies, deception, and outright fraud. For the most part, the company's response flatly denied most of the accusations against it — but many require a little nuance. Perhaps most notably, the company would like you to know that its truck did, in fact, simply roll down a hill for a video shoot. However, the video was not a lie, Nikola said, because it was shot by a third party and never insinuated the truck was actually moving on its own power. As for the other allegations, even Wall Street's top analysts have brushed off most concerns in the Hindenburg allegations, given that they had to do with things that occurred before Nikola's full launch or at founder Trevor Milton's previous companies.",BOE,en,Business Insider

The latest reported instance came Wednesday morning, involving a US Air Force RC-135S Cobra Ball out of Okinawa attempting to observe Chinese PLA missile tests being conducted in the Yellow Sea . Boeing RC-135S Cobra Ball, file image via Flickr It was a Chinese think tank called the South China Sea Probing Initiative (SCSPI), based at China’s Peking University, that first observed the strange behavior of a plane which appeared on tracking radar as a ""mysterious Malaysian plane"" soon after an Air Force jet ""went dark"" by allegedly switching off its transponder .

Bombers have played an essential part of warfare since their introduction. Their ability to flatten cities and cripple critical infrastructure and their role in the nuclear triad have cemented them as a must-have for any modern military. The US military knows this well. For over 80 years, it has fielded some of the best bombers the world has ever seen. The Flying Fortress The Boeing B-17 was built in response to a 1934 request by the US Army Air Corps (USAAC) for strategic bombers. The Corps wanted a plane capable of flying at 10,000 feet, at speeds of up 200 mph, with a range of 2,000 miles. Within a year, Boeing flew its four-engine prototype, the B-17. A reporter from the Seattle Times, noting the 13 machine guns in turrets on the upper fuselage, belly, tail, and nose, described it as a ""flying fortress.""

The redesign came after two incidents in which an engine unexpectedly shut down in the middle of a flight, after drinks were spilled onto that control panel. The cupholders in the Airbus A350 are smaller than those found in other planes, and pilots have tended to use the center console as a makeshift table for their drinks. And as anyone who's nursed a hot beverage while flying must know, putting a cup on a flat surface in midair is a good way to prompt a spill.
