The 176-foot boosters being tested — which NASA calls ""the largest, most powerful boosters ever built for flight"" — are part of the agency's Space Launch System (SLS), which it intends to use to fly astronauts to the lunar surface. It's part of a larger program called Artemis: a roughly $30 billion effort to put boots back on the moon for the first time since the 1970s. Wednesday's test involved a booster prototype built by Northrop Grumman, one of several private companies NASA has contracted to build the 365-foot-tall SLS. The prototype rumbled to life at 3:05 p.m. ET, at the company's testing facility in the hills of Promontory, Utah. It belched out an estimated 3.6 million pounds of thrust, blasting the desert with fire, smoke, and sand for 126 seconds — the exact amount of time it'd have to work during a real flight.
