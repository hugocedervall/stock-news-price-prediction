Major ecommerce platform Shopify will be the first to integrate the Stripe Treasury offering early next year: Under the name Shopify Balance, it will offer bank accounts to the hundreds of thousands of merchants that use its platform. Stripe wants to eventually launch Stripe Treasury outside of the US through partnerships with Citi and Barclays. In expanding beyond merchant services, Stripe is positioning itself as a threat to both payments service providers and BaaS providers . Stripe has grown its banking services as of late: It just expanded its Stripe Capital platform, which allows online platforms to offer financing to business customers.",YELP,en,Business Insider

Long before cloud computing was a thing, for instance, Ellison proselytized the premature notion of a network computer. Later he picked up a disgraced ex-computer hardware CEO, the late Mark Hurd , and made him an Oracle selling machine. Then there was the time a few years ago when Ellison seriously considered swapping a giant chunk of Oracle stock for SoftBank's stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. This never-before-reported gambit didn't see the light of the day because Oracle's board of directors squashed it. Given how much Alibaba's stock has outperformed Oracle's, it would have been a hell of a trade. But that's another story. All this talk of Ellison's bold if bizarre moves is highly relevant now because of Oracle's increasingly quixotic quest to grab a piece of TikTok, the Chinese-owned dance-video phenomenon beloved by youngsters of all ages.",YELP,en,Business Insider

Urban amenities -- like restaurants, nightlife, museums and sports venues -- have long drawn Americans to live in large cities. While demand remains strong there , many buyers are seeking a new balance of indoor and outdoor space and affordability while still maintaining that big-city feel. A new Cityness Index by Zillow® and Yelp Inc. (NYSE: YELP ) pinpoints the U.S. suburbs that best strike that balance. There is a ""Great Reshuffling"" on the horizon. Yelp data shows that the number of quotes requested for movers recently increased 34% in San Francisco , 22% in New York and 6% in Los Angeles 1 . This desire to move is also reflected in a recent Zillow poll of people newly working from home because of the pandemic, with two-thirds saying they would consider moving if they had the flexibility to work from home occasionally. ""At Yelp, we're seeing consumer interest and requests for quotes in categories like movers, packing services and mortgage lenders increase in major metro areas, compared to the same time period last year,"" says Tara Lewis , Yelp trend expert. ""For city dwellers who don't want to sacrifice great amenities like restaurants, art galleries and nightlife, but are dreaming of a little more space and a more affordable lifestyle, these suburbs offer a similar variety of great local businesses.""

The virus-induced downturn has led the economy into a ""liquidity trap,"" in which interest rates will likely reside on the zero lower bound until 2023, and monetary policy could have trouble stimulating the real economy besides artificially inflating asset prices. As Washington pumps fiscal injection after fiscal injection into the real economy, creating unstable artificial growth, the latest lapse of fiscal support, now 46 days, has sent the economy into another slump . For more color on the deep economic scarring, not just a deterioration in the labor market, we turn our attention to a Yelp report published Wednesday that revealed as of Aug. 31, 163,735 businesses have closed on the platform, a 23% increase since mid-July. Yelp pointed out an increase of permanent business closures over the past six months, now reaching 97,966, or about 60% of closed businesses will never reopen their doors again.

The superior customer service expectations of millennials, declines in hospital profitability, and threats from startup providers and retail pharmacies intensify the need for providers to revamp the patient experience.
