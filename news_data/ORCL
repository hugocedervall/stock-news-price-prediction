But here we are, steadily setting fresh records mainly due to investor enthusiasm that normal times could be around the corner. That’s a very optimistic view, and it’s not because there’s doubt about vaccines eventually bringing life back. It’s just that logistically, the vaccine rollout is one of the biggest challenges in medical history. We’ve talked about this every day and it might sound like a broken record by now, but you can’t discount the chance of some hitches along the way. Any kind of setback in getting people vaccinated certainly has the chance of pushing back against this optimism. Also, you can’t ignore the fact that COVID-19 cases continue to set new highs and some states and cities are shutting down. Some experts say it could be a long winter.

President Trump in August signed an executive order that would officially ban any U.S. transactions with TikTok if its Chinese parent ByteDance did not reach a deal to divest it to a U.S. company. Commerce Department officials later said they were taking the unprecedented step of banning the app because of the risks posed by its data collection practices and Chinese ownership. On Monday, however, U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington concluded that President Trump had overstepped his authority in using his emergency economic powers to try to put the wildly popular app out of business. Nichols wrote that the government ""likely exceeded IEEPA's [the International Emergency Economic Powers Act] express limitations as part of an agency action that was arbitrary and capricious.""

Personal finance management (PFM) tools can allow banks to create highly personalized customer experiences and, in turn, drive revenue and retention. The diversity of today's PFM market illustrates the value that a wide range of providers see in developing such offerings, but its promise — PFM was lauded as the future of banking for over a decade — has long failed to materialize for most incumbent banks as well as consumers. PFM user share plateaued at between 10% and 12% as of 2017, the most recently available data, per Celent. This plateau is the result of several design flaws that made earlier iterations of PFM tools unengaging. These include only showing users their financial data without providing actionable insights, personalized financial advice, or tools to manage their finances more easily; poor user experience (UX) due to many banks' PFM functionalities being confined to separate tabs to better track engagement metrics; and limited data sharing before open banking regulations (in some jurisdictions), making personalization difficult to achieve due to incomplete financial data for each user.",ORCL,en,Business Insider

A similar joint filing was made by Amazon.com Inc., AT&T Inc., Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp., Comcast Corp., Sonos Inc., Duck Duck Go Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc.Concerns about such disclosures have emerged since the government sued Google for allegedly abusing its power to thwart competition.

Long before cloud computing was a thing, for instance, Ellison proselytized the premature notion of a network computer. Later he picked up a disgraced ex-computer hardware CEO, the late Mark Hurd , and made him an Oracle selling machine. Then there was the time a few years ago when Ellison seriously considered swapping a giant chunk of Oracle stock for SoftBank's stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. This never-before-reported gambit didn't see the light of the day because Oracle's board of directors squashed it. Given how much Alibaba's stock has outperformed Oracle's, it would have been a hell of a trade. But that's another story. All this talk of Ellison's bold if bizarre moves is highly relevant now because of Oracle's increasingly quixotic quest to grab a piece of TikTok, the Chinese-owned dance-video phenomenon beloved by youngsters of all ages.","OKTA,ORCL",en,Business Insider

Last week, the company filed for a 30-day extension with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the body responsible for approving a sale. But ByteDance claims the CFIUS hasn't responded to its request—so now the company has turned to the federal appeals court to grant an injunction allowing it to continue operations, per TechCrunch . This saga has been confusing and drawn out—here are some of our lingering questions: Didn't TikTok avoid a ban back in September with its Oracle deal? Yes and no. September 20 was the deadline for ByteDance to strike a deal to sell TikTok to a US company, which was met with the Oracle/Walmart deal. But today, November 12, is the deadline to actually complete the sale.

""Everybody, everything was shut down, people weren't investing and the market was frozen,"" Wuischpard told Business Insider. ""The original idea is we'd only raise you know $8 to $10 million, and that'd be enough to tide us over. But people were opening up. We kept increasing the size of the round and lo and behold we got ourselves back to the $35 million number.""

The company aims to make it easier for organizations to manage a host of different cloud-based software services, including Salesforce's signature customer relationship management tool and Oracle's NetSuite. Salto essentially allows customers to make back-end adjustments to all their tools at once, instead of manually having to change each one independently. The engineering work is complex, but the company is effectively taking the individual code of each platform and manipulating it to create a ""connective tissue"" that works between all of the systems, according to cofounder and CEO Rami Tamir. ""Each of the changes you do in a different silo: Synchronizing all of those and creating a solution that goes across is very hard to do,"" he told Business Insider. ""If you can take a look at the whole thing holistically and create one change across all of those systems, you will save a lot of money, a lot of time.",ORCL,en,Business Insider

Subscribe today to receive industry-changing financial news and analysis to your inbox. Personal finance management (PFM) tools can allow banks to create highly personalized customer experiences and, in turn, drive revenue and retention. The diversity of today's PFM market illustrates the value that a wide range of providers see in developing such offerings, but its promise — PFM was lauded as the future of banking for over a decade — has long failed to materialize for most incumbent banks as well as consumers. PFM user share plateaued at between 10% and 12% as of 2017, the most recently available data, per Celent. This plateau is the result of several design flaws that made earlier iterations of PFM tools unengaging. These include only showing users their financial data without providing actionable insights, personalized financial advice, or tools to manage their finances more easily; poor user experience (UX) due to many banks' PFM functionalities being confined to separate tabs to better track engagement metrics; and limited data sharing before open banking regulations (in some jurisdictions), making personalization difficult to achieve due to incomplete financial data for each user.",ORCL,en,Business Insider

But where Augury differs, according to CEO and cofounder Saar Yoskovitz, is that it develops both the hardware and the software that its clients use, making it a so-called ""full stack"" provider. ""What you typically find is that every one of these projects begins with a seven-month integration project, just to get all the data, and sanitize it, and cleanse it before you can start building models,"" he told Business Insider.

The Tuber app allows online Chinese users to skirt the nation's ""Great Firewall,"" an internet ban that blocks many popular US apps in the Communist country. The get-around was short-lived — it launched last week, and after a journalist with the state-backed publication Global Times tweeted about it, Tuber reportedly disappeared from the Huawei app store. The app, which is backed by a subsidiary of the Chinese cybersecurity firm Qihoo 360, is also now unavailable on Apple's App Store, according to CNBC. Qihoo 360 did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. China has a long history of censoring the internet, strictly regulating the kinds of websites and services users can access.

Reuters reported Sunday that Triller was in talks with investment bank Farvahar Partners about a potential merger and IPO. Sources told Reuters the merger, if successful, would be with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). SPACs are essentially shell companies that go public to raise capital in order to acquire a company, allowing their target to easily obtain a public listing. Triller was simultaneously in talks to raise a private fundraising round, sources told Reuters, adding that it had raised $100 million at a valuation of $1.25 billion so far. Reuters' sources said Triller was deciding whether to carry on with the private raise or forge a deal with the SPAC. They added that no deal was certain yet. Triller was not immediately available to comment on the report when contacted by Business Insider.

That growth has led it to a $95.6 million valuation and a partnership with Intel, with the two teaming up to serve major customers like Burger King and Tencent Cloud. Anyscale's cofounders are known as the founders of Ray, an open source software project that makes it easier for developers to build applications that are distributed across multiple computers — useful for machine learning tasks that require more memory and overall processing power than any single processor can handle. As for Intel, it had been developing an open source big data and AI project called Analytics Zoo. But its engineers saw the potential of Ray, and started using it to build advanced AI-powered applications. It was a natural fit, in some ways: Intel already has an active collaboration with UC Berkeley's RISELab, home to the Ray development team. In fact, Intel used Apache Spark, an open source data analytics tool borne of UC Berkeley's AMPLab, to build much of Analytics Zoo.",ORCL,en,Business Insider

2020-10-09 12:46:49-05:00,TikTok will be around until at least after the presidential election. Here's what that means for the app's future.,"Summary List Placement The Trump administration's attempts to issue an unprecedented nationwide ban on TikTok will be delayed until at least after Election Day 2020. A federal judge has scheduled a hearing for November 4, the day after the presidential election, to make a decision on whether the US government's ban of the viral video-sharing app can be implemented later in the month. The government's attempt at instating its first part of the ban is already being stymied by a temporary injunction granted last month, which the Trump administration appealed on Thursday. But the impending calendar date is still a month away, meaning there's ample time for TikTok and its Beijing-based owner ByteDance to make further moves to ensure the app's future in the US. The delay gives TikTok even further leeway as it grapples to survive in a months-long battle characterized by political jockeying and back-and-forth negotiations. But come November 4, a federal judge will be tasked with deciding whether to block the US government's planned ban, which would take place on November 12 without obstruction.",ORCL,en,Business Insider

The 449-page document accuses Google of being ""an ecosystem of interlocking monopolies"" and an ""overwhelmingly dominant"" online search provider. One of the report's many conclusions is that Google has used its dominance in one market to favor its own products, with its Chrome web browser being one example. The report highlighted how Google began promoting its Chrome browser at the top corner of the Google.com homepage in 2009 in an effort to get Internet Explorer users to switch. It also revealed that not all employees were happy about it.

Over the past week, Biden advisers have honed in on questions about the world’s second largest economy – anticipating attacks from President Donald Trump on the former vice president’s record of dealing with Beijing.If he beats Trump, Biden will need to decide whether to scrap, keep or escalate the billions in tariffs levied against Chinese imports, and whether to stick to or renegotiate the partial trade deal Trump signed in January.He’d have to determine if his administration continues the sanctions imposed on Chinese officials for their crackdown on human rights in Hong Kong and the western region of Xinjiang and possibly expand those sanctions further.Biden would also inherit a litany of restrictions to cut off Chinese technology companies’ access to American intellectual property and a patchwork of relationships across the region that could help, or complicate, tensions with China.PrioritiesBiden’s campaign advisers say they would prioritize domestic issues like investing in research and development and U.S. manufacturing to compete with Beijing from a position of strength -- and deal with international matters like trade later.",ORCL,en,Economic Times India

TikTok first filed an injunction request Wednesday as part of the company's lawsuit against the US government challenging the legality of Trump's proposed ban. The judge in the injunction, unsealed Monday, said the ban likely goes beyond the ""lawful bounds"" of the authority Donald Trump cited in his August executive orders to ban TikTok.

Wer von der Ausnahmesituation profitiert hat (und wer nicht). Die Corona-Pandemie hat in den vergangenen Monaten eine Tal- und Bergfahrt bereitet (in dieser Reihenfolge!) – auch an den Aktienmärkten. Fast überall auf der Welt gab es Lockdowns, die Wirtschaft hat sich über weite Strecken verlangsamt und stand/steht in einigen Branchen komplett still. Ein Umstand, der sich auch auf die Seismografen der Wirtschaft, die Börsen, unmittelbar ausgewirkt hat.

Warum diese Fahrt an den Börsen eine so rasante war? Für die rasche Erholung ortet der Experte drei Gründe. Nicht wie die Krise 2008 Zum einen habe es ""eine unglaubliche Reaktion aus Geld- und Fiskalpolitik“ gegeben. Hier gebe es auch einen großen Unterschied zur Finanzmarktkrise von 2008 – die Reaktion auf diese war nämlich nur auf geldpolitischer Seite verortet. „Von der Fiskalpolitik hat es praktisch keinen Impuls gegeben.“ Zweiter Grund für das starke Ab und auch wieder Auf war der Lockdown bzw. dessen Ende.",ORCL,de,KURIER Medienhaus

In August, China expanded its list of ""forbidden and restricted technology exports"" to include ""personalized information recommendation services based on data analysis"" — such as the algorithm that powers TikTok.

Trump has repeatedly argued that the US government should get a cut of any deal involving the sale of TikTok's assets to an American company, which he has sought to force through multiple executive orders due to alleged national security concerns.

2020-09-18 10:03:28-05:00,"Why Trump's TikTok Ban Could Be 'Fort Sumter Moment' In Cold Tech War Between US, China","The drama over the fate of popular Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok is ongoing Friday, with the U.S. Commerce Department announcing that it will ban U.S. business transactions on TikTok starting Sunday. What Happened? Chinese-owned TikTok and WeChat will seemingly no longer be able to do business in the U.S. starting on Sunday, presumably unless the two companies announce deals with U.S. companies that gain the approval of President Donald Trump. Why It’s Important: TikTok has taken the U.S. by storm in 2020, and the app now has more than 100 million users. Trump has pushed for TikTok’s parent company ByteDance to sell the platform to an American company due to national security concerns. ByteDance was reportedly seeking a $30-billion valuation for TikTok in buyout negotiations, but the company recently rejected a bid from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and partner Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT ). On Monday, TikTok announced a deal proposal to add U.S. company Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL ) as a “trusted technology partner,” pending Trump’s approval.",ORCL,en,Benzinga

A source close to TikTok and Oracle told Axios the companies' deal — which currently under review by the US government — includes the stipulation that Oracle will examine TikTok's source code to make sure there aren't any backdoors. Backdoors are technical vulnerabilities deliberately left in software so that hackers can break in. The source told Axios Oracle will be able to review all updates to TikTok rolls out, and TikTok US will have its own government-approved board including a security director and security subcommittee comprised of US citizens. These details are notable because Oracle has to convince the Trump administration to allow it to take a majority stake in TikTok, rather than buying it outright. Last month Trump tried to force TikTok to completely sell off its US operations to an American company using two executive orders. The US Commerce Department issued an order on Friday banning new downloads of the TikTok app starting from September 20, although sources told Reuters this ban could be revoked if TikTok and Oracle get their deal signed off before then.",ORCL,en,Business Insider

2020-09-11 07:09:44-05:00,"Trump’s TikTok ban leaves Apple, Google stuck","By Shelly BanjoIt's looking increasingly likely that TikTok won’t be able to sell its U.S. operations by the mid-September deadline imposed in an executive order issued by President Donald Trump last month. That doesn’t mean the video app beloved by tens of millions of teens will go dark overnight.Trump on Thursday said he wouldn’t extend a Sept. 20 deadline for a deal. But ByteDance Ltd., TikTok’s Chinese owner, may need more time to negotiate with suitors after new regulations from Beijing complicated the deal. The president has said if a deal isn’t done by the specified date then he’ll shut down TikTok.But Unlike India, which recently banned the app and immediately severed users’ access, the U.S. doesn't afford the president the authority to close down a social media site or require service providers to block access to an app. So TikTok could remain on people’s phones and they’d still be able to create dance videos, at least for a while.Experts say the more likely scenario would be requiring Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google to kick TikTok out of their app stores and cut off access to developer tools, preventing new downloads and subsequent software updates to current users.",ORCL,en,Economic Times India

While companies including Microsoft, Walmart, and Oracle were reportedly bidding to buy TikTok, the new rules from China could slow down negotiations. Experts and analysts told Business Insider that the tense state of affairs between the US and China seem unlikely to deescalate, and could have lasting implications for the future of tech commerce between the two countries. In the immediate term, US companies could see falling sales in China as nationalistic sentiment there turns against the US.

Der US-Supermarktgigant Walmart hat in den vergangenen Wochen mehrfach für Schlagzeilen gesorgt. Zunächst einmal will der Konzern zusammen mit Microsoft das US-Geschäft der populären Video-App Tiktok übernehmen. Heute, Dienstag, könnte es frühestens eine Entscheidung dazu geben. Microsoft-Walmart und der US-Softwarekonzern Oracle gehören jedenfalls zu den Top-Bietern. Dabei geht es um einen Deal in der Höhe von rund 30 Milliarden Dollar. Hintergrund: US-Präsident Trump hat amerikanischen Firmen und Bürgern Geschäfte mit Tiktok untersagt, das Verbot soll Mitte September greifen. Ohne einen Verkauf droht Tiktok das Aus in den USA. Trump bezeichnete die Video-App als Sicherheitsrisiko, weil über die App chinesische Behörden Zugriff auf US-Daten bekommen könnten. Tiktok und die chinesischen Mutterfirma Bytedance haben die Vorwürfe zurückgewiesen und sind vor Gericht gegangen. Zwei Mio.

2020-09-07 06:09:44-05:00,Experts dissected TikTok's algorithm and say a US buyer will struggle to replicate its magic,"Summary List Placement A prospective TikTok buyer may struggle to replicate the video app's magic if it buys the service without its recommendation algorithms, experts tell Business Insider. Parent company ByteDance is currently in negotiations with bidders over the sale of TikTok's US business after President Trump in August ordered a sale or total ban. Lead bidders for the floated $20- to $30 billion deal include Microsoft, in partnership with Walmart, and Oracle. But discussions have been slowed by new Chinese rules restricting the export of key services, including algorithms. The upshot is that a US buyer may end up buying TikTok's US arm but licensing the recommendation algorithm that makes the app so compelling. ""I personally think TikTok wouldn't be TikTok without its algorithm,"" said Bondy Valdovinos Kaye, a researcher at Queensland University of Technology, who has investigated TikTok. Employees call TikTok's algorithm its crown jewel TikTok has charmed around 100 million users in the US, and superficially isn't that different from YouTube.",ORCL,en,Business Insider

Some days, self-care meant rising before the sun to meditate for 30 minutes. Other days, it meant eating a bowl of pasta on the couch, with a glass of wine and a Bravo show. But with the arrival of COVID-19, everything changed, and I was forced to live a more insular life. Although being stuck in my house had many downsides, there was one positive development: without the distraction of the outside world, it was easier to implement a daily self-care routine. It didn't take long to realize that taking time for myself, even during a workday, was imperative for my well-being during this stressful time. Here's the routine that works for me: 7:00 am : I get out of bed, gratefully accept a cup of tea from my husband, and begin to write in my journal. Today I have a lot going on in my head, and I pour my thoughts, feelings, worries, and ideas into three pages in my notebook.

2020-08-20 13:43:54-05:00,View: Every cloud has a silver lining. So has TikTok for Indian cloud giants,"By Mishi Choudhary & Eben MoglenThe TikTok Wars of 2020 are crucial signposts in the history of the internet.When GoI began agitating for restrictions on the video-sharing app, the context was a painful souring in India-China ties. The geopolitical signalling involved was far more important than the extent to which the app ban furthered the ‘digital sovereignty’ posture of the government.But with President Donald Trump’s onslaught against TikTok in the US, the fate of a video-clip service has taken ona larger meaning. The essentially trivial dispute has begun redesigning the architecture of the consumer-facinginternet in major societies. Indian digital enterprises and individual citizens will both be fundamentallyaffected by what happens next.Today’s internet, like ship-breaking, makes its living in a toxic trade. The ‘platform’ social media companies distribute goods they do not pay to make ‘for free’, in return for all the personal information on they can mine from their users. They employ smartphones for doing this.TikTok gives (primarily) young people the service of storing and distributing their short videos.",ORCL,en,Economic Times India

2020-08-18 21:09:23-05:00,The reason behind Oracle’s bid for TikTok,"By Nico GrantOracle Corp.’s preliminary interest in making a bid for TikTok, on first glance, looks like an awkward fit -- the 43-year-old software giant best known for legacy corporate databases and the music-video sharing app beloved by teens seem as different as two companies can be.But the match may not be as far-fetched as it first appears. The world’s second-largest software maker has approached investors including Sequoia Capital to partner on a bid for TikTok’s business in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg late Monday.The company’s possible pursuit of a deal for the social network, owned by China’s ByteDance Ltd., makes more sense in light of Oracle’s desire to build up its cloud-computing and consumer-data businesses -- and comes into even clearer focus considering Oracle’s close ties to U.S. President Donald Trump and Chairman Larry Ellison’s cheerleading for American tech interests.Microsoft Corp. has been seen as the front-runner in the race to acquire TikTok’s U.S. assets, and is the only company to publicly confirm talks with ByteDance.",ORCL,en,Economic Times India

Even the economic stimulus package doled out by the government for MSMEs did little to soothe the woes of a sector which found itself in the eye of the storm or, in this case, the fury unleashed by the virus.But there is another side of this story as well.

The shares of the Indian conglomerate have doubled from a low in March, just as other billionaires on the list have been hit by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.While the Indian economy “has been nearly decimated” during the lockdown to control the spread of Covid-19, “Mr. Ambani’s companies (particularly the telecom giant Jio) have prospered, and his personal wealth has increased substantially,” said Jayati Ghosh, chair of the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning at the Jawaharlal Nehru University.A media representative for Reliance declined to comment on Ambani’s fortune.The rise of the 63-year-old as India heads for its worst-ever recession is a reminder of the nation’s deep economic divide, in which the top 10% hold more than three-quarters of the total wealth, and where most new fortune creation stays in the hands of the richest 1%.",ORCL,en,Economic Times India

Several analysts have weighed in on Oracle shares since the Tuesday afternoon report. The stock was down 4.73% at $52.01 at the time of publication Wednesday. Seeing Is Believing Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss said management’s confidence in accelerating revenue growth moving forward was surprising. “Valuation at 12X CY21e EPS remains undemanding, but investors likely have to see the growth before believing it,” the analyst said. Wells Fargo analyst Philip Winslow said better-than-expected profitability and an expanding operating margin are evidence that Oracle is managing its expenses. “As the headwinds from the transition to the cloud abate relative to the increase in recurring subscription revenue and as customers increasingly lift-and-shift database workloads to Oracle Cloud, we believe that …",ORCL,en,Benzinga Feeds

In an environment of fear, financial institutions become a lot tighter with their money, and that inevitably causes economic activity to slow down. For example, just consider what happened in 2008. Mortgage lending standards suddenly became much more strict, and that greatly contributed to the horrific housing price crash which left millions upon millions of Americans underwater on their mortgages. Unfortunately, this coronavirus pandemic has created a wave of fear that is far greater than what we experienced during the last recession, and that has enormous implications for the months ahead. Extremely loose lending standards helped create debt-fueled “booms” throughout our economy in recent years, but now lending standards are going in the complete opposite direction very rapidly.",ORCL,en,Zero Hedge

2020-01-10 13:22:12-05:00,Why Most US Utilities Are Failing to Make the Most of Their Smart Meters,"Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) — the two-way communicating smart meters that now serve more than half of U.S. electric customers — allows utilities to offer their customers time-of-use pricing, automated demand response, near real-time energy data feedback, and other tools to better link them to the true cost of electricity and encourage them to save it. AMI networks also collect masses of interval data — a gold mine for a raft of utility improvements, from sorting and targeting customers to optimize efficiency spending, to informing distribution grid outage recovery and conservation voltage reduction (CVR) schemes. These are all proven methods to improve energy efficiency, and they can really add up when multiplied across millions of customers. But today few U.S. utilities are capturing this full range of AMI capabilities, according to a new report from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) — and some are hardly capturing any at all. That’s a waste of ratepayer-funded assets for those that have already deployed AMI, although relatively few states have taken their utilities to task for failing to deliver on efficiency and customer engagement targets, with some exceptions like Illinois .",ORCL,en,Green Technology

Cloud companies like Salesforce pioneered the model, but experts say the 2008 financial crisis was the inflection point — as companies cut costs, the pay-as-you-go model became very attractive. Companies like Adobe and Microsoft made the switch to focus on a subscription model and have reaped the rewards, as their businesses boom. Subscription software companies say that the model is actually better for users — the software gets more features, more often, and customers don't have to pay a high sticker price up front to get started. However, critics note that over the course of the lifetime of a subscription, users will often pay more than they would have if they bought the software outright.

2019-12-02 19:32:13-05:00,4 Ways for Professional Services to Improve Profits and Performance,"Manufacturers have long been able to track costs and value using granular metrics at a systems level. This has enabled them to grow revenue and maintain profits in incredibly challenging circumstances. Now, technology has evolved to enable small-to-medium professional services firms to do the same. Firms need to track and quantify costs and value for more abstract factors, such as knowledge and skills. Two technology-driven capabilities now make this quantification possible: automation and visibility. Once you automate measuring different aspects of your business, details that you haven’t been able to easily see begin emerging, including hours billed, realized bill rates, and utilization statistics. Being able to quantify this kind of detail, from beginning to end, helps medium and midsized professional services firms find more ways for employees—and the business itself—to be as productive and as profitable as possible. The payoffs include making proactive rather than reactive course adjustments to prevent full-on project or performance issues; increased employee and customer satisfaction; scalable processes and workflows; and more sales and profit.",ORCL,en,Oracle Blogs

2019-02-27 13:26:46-05:00,Warning Shot? Amazon Pulls Out Of Seattle Office Tower At Center Of Homeless Tax Debate,"As community activists in Virginia, emboldened by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's successful campaign to drive Amazon out of Queens, push back against Amazon's plan to build its HQ2 in Crystal City, it looks like Amazon is preemptively scaling back its plans to expand in Seattle as it braces for more pushback from progressives. According to a report published by GeekWire, which managed to obtain a copy of a marketing flier circulated by the company, Amazon is seeking to sublet 30 floors of office space in a new building in Rainer Square - which is still under construction. A marketing flier obtained by GeekWire confirms that the tech giant is seeking new tenants for its office space in Rainier Square, a building under construction that will one day be the city’s second-tallest skyscraper. Amazon had leased all 30 floors of office space in the building. After weeks of rumors, the listing was made official over the weekend, according to real estate brokers familiar with the marketing efforts.",ORCL,en,Zero Hedge

2019-02-15 07:52:40-05:00,"After Saying iPhone ""Enormously Underpriced"", Buffett Trims Apple Stake","Berkshire Hathaway's latest 13-F filing shows Warren Buffett was unusually active during Q4 as the billionaire investor rushed to take advantage of the volatility in markets to buy into banks and insurers that he has long had his eye on, in keeping with Buffett's famous maxim: ""Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful."" Buffett continued to bid up bank shares, making his Omaha-based firm a major shareholder in four of the five largest US banks. This includes increasing stakes in JP Morgan and Bank of America during the last three months of the year. Buffett also boosted his stakes in regional lenders like PNC Financial Services Group and US Bancorp which may have been plays on consolidation in the industry (a trend that is starting to play out following the recent BB&T-Suntrust deal ). And while bank stocks have rallied during the opening weeks of the year during one of the biggest market rebounds in recent memory, Buffett unexpectedly cut his stake in Apple.",ORCL,en,Zero Hedge

"" "" We face hard decisions that are coming due ,"" said Newsom. ""The choices we make will shape our future, and the future of quite literally millions, for decades to come."" Newsom told a joint session of the Legislature that, for the high-speed rail, “ there simply isn’t a path to get from Sacramento to San Diego, let alone from San Francisco to L.A. I wish there were .” - SF Chronicle The project - the type of transportation centerpiece included in Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's so-called "" Green New Deal ,"" was slated to cost California taxpayers approximately $77 billion, with a completion date of 2033. The timing of Newsom giving up on the dream of high-speed rail between LA and SF as ""too expensive"" versus the Green New Deal's fairytale dream of replacing all domestic air & car travel with high-speed rail couldn't be more…inauspicious. — Esoteric Jeff (@EsotericCD) February 12, 2019 Newsom says that instead of a statewide system, he wants the high-speed rail line to go from Merced to Bakersfield along California's Central Valley, which he says could bring an economic transformation to the state's agricultural region.",ORCL,en,Zero Hedge
2019-02-10 16:10:00-05:00,Market Magic Show Exposed In The Absurdity Of Friday's Close,"Authored by Sven Henrich via NorthmanTrader.com, This week markets reached the key resistance confluence zone I’ve been outlining and rejected from there. Still $SPX managed to close the week positively by 1 handle making it the 7th consecutive week of uninterrupted gains . Whether this rejection is meaningful remains unproven at this stage. From my perch price discovery remains engaged in a battle for control between 2600 and 2730-2760 on $SPX. This aggressive rally has achieved what it was technically meant to: Reconnect with moving averages and achieve balance. But for now it remains a rally below the 200 daily moving average: It remains a rally below the weekly 50MA: And it remains a rally below the monthly 15MA: And hence the larger potential bull trap structure remains in play for now: $DJIA failed to recapture its broken 2016 trend line: Yet fact remains that ever since the big central bank capitulation of 2019 markets have not had a single down week.
