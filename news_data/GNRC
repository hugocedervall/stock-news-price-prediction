2020-11-03 13:09:00-05:00,SolarEdge Delays Battery Launch as Residential Solar Sales Bolster Slow Commercial Rebound,"SolarEdge is feeling the pinch of the COVID-19 pandemic in the form of a slower-than-expected recovery for its customers in the commercial solar market. The pandemic also delayed the launch of the company's residential battery system, as SolarEdge aims to compete with microinverter rival Enphase and other contenders in the fast-growing market for home solar-and-storage systems. Still, the Israel-based company reported strong third quarter results Monday, bolstered by an uptick in residential sales for its solar inverters and power optimizers in North America and Europe. Total revenues of $338.1 million rose about 2 percent from the previous quarter, driven by record European revenues of $165.6 million, up from $144.3 million in the prior quarter. While North American revenues fell slightly from the second quarter, installation rates and sell-through rates from its distributors were up, CEO Zvi Lando said in Monday’s earnings call. But the recovery from pandemic-related slowdowns in the second quarter hasn’t come to the commercial sector as rapidly as it has for residential, he said. “Commercial installations both in Europe and the U.S. and even in Australia are recovering slower than residential and inventories in the channel are still high,” he said.",GNRC,en,Green Technology Media

2020-10-09 08:14:00-05:00,Fund manager Brandon Nelson is tripling his benchmark in 2020 with 'less-discovered' companies that become big winners. Here are 3 themes and 9 stocks he's betting on.,"Summary List Placement Brandon Nelson has been running his mutual fund for almost 10 years, and Wall Street has been treating small-company stocks like the minor leagues the entire time. It doesn't bother him. Judged against his peers, Nelson is nobody's backup. His Calamos Timpani Small Cap Growth Fund has returned 252% in that almost-ten-year stretch, a return that tops that of the S&P 500, small-company indexes, and most of his peers, according to Morningstar. This year alone, Nelson had hauled in a 37.1% return as of October 7. Morningstar data shows that's more than double the typical return for the category and more than triple the gain logged by the Russell 2000 Growth index, his benchmark. He thinks investors' views of those companies are due to change. And when they do, even better times might be on the way for his sector. ""It's got a lot of fundamental strength and it's very inexpensive versus large-cap growth,"" he said of small caps in an exclusive interview with Business Insider. "" If money's going to reallocate away from large-cap growth , it seems to me, small-cap growth is a logical place to go."" Nelson says there are essentially two types of growth companies in his portfolio: Cyclical companies that will perform the best when the economy is firing on all cylinders, and secular growth firms benefiting from crucial trends.",GNRC,en,Business Insider

Financial terms of the acquisition weren’t disclosed, but Enbala CEO Bud Vos said in a Tuesday interview said that “our investors would call it a very large success.” Enbala’s DER orchestration software platform is orchestrating roughly 600 megawatts of flexible loads like pumps and motors, backup generators and behind-the-meter batteries grid services in the U.S., Canada and Australia, according to Wood Mackenzie data. That software can now be put to use enabling Generac’s existing fleet of thousands of megawatts of residential and industrial standby power generation deployed across the United States, as well as its expanding business selling its PWRCell batteries for standalone or solar-linked home backup.

Unlike many solar and storage companies pitching customers on backup power, OutBack is including fossil fuels, which it says will optimize the system and allow it to more effectively handle greater loads. “Our products have pretty much since the beginning enabled customers to connect a generator to them. In the off-grid world, that’s really not optional — you have to do that because there’s going to be times where there simply isn’t sufficient solar resource for the loads you need to run,” said Paul Dailey, OutBack’s director of product and market strategy. “What we’re doing in this instance is bringing that to the backup scenario.” Since its founding, Arizona-based OutBack has focused on hardware that can withstand harsh environments.",GNRC,en,Green Technology Media
