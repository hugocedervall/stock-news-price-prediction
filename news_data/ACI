Newly released economic data including expanding global purchasing-manager indexes, rising retail sales in the US and Europe, increasing global trade volume, and decreasing inventory levels are all pointing to an ongoing economic rebound, Morgan Stanley said in a Friday research note. However, it is the strength of the US consumer that cements the equity strategy team's view on the ""intact"" recovery, wrote strategist Adam Virgadamo, noting that ""US household personal income already reached 2% above pre-COVID levels in August."" Further driving the recovery will be the efficacy data from three coronavirus vaccine candidates in November. Under ""operation warp speed,"" the US government has purchased hundreds of millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses from Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Sanofi/GSK, and Novavax. ""Companies have been ramping production capacity such that hundreds of millions of doses could be available in the US within this time frame (each vaccination requires 2 doses to be effective),"" said Virgadamo.",ACI,en,Business Insider
