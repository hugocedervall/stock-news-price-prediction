2020-12-07 07:30:21-05:00,Blue Origin Will Take First Woman Astronaut to the Moon,"Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin will take the first woman to the moon’s surface, the billionaire said on Friday as NASA nears a decision to pick its first privately built lunar landers capable of sending astronauts to the moon by 2024. “This (BE-7) is the engine that will take the first woman to the surface of the Moon,” Bezos said in a post on Instagram with a video of the engine test this week at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The BE-7 engine, which Blue Origin has been developing for years, has tallied 1,245 seconds of test-fire time and will power the company’s National Team Human Landing System lunar lander. Blue Origin leads a “national team” as the prime contractor that it assembled in 2019 to help build its Blue Moon lander. That team includes Lockheed Martin Corp, Northrop Grumman Corp and Draper. Blue Origin has vied for lucrative government contracts in recent years and is competing with rival billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Dynetics, owned by Leidos Holdings Inc, to win a contract to build NASA’s next human lunar landing system to ferry humans to the moon in the next decade.",LDOS,en,Novinite

Una campaña encabezada por el Consejo de Seguridad Nacional y un grupo de agencias públicas estadounidenses está intentando conseguir que los gobiernos europeos erradiquen Nuctech , una empresa china bien conectada y controlada por el Estado, cuyos sistemas de control de carga, equipaje y pasajeros se están convirtiendo en algo habitual en puertos, fronteras y aeropuertos de toda Europa. El intento de los Estados Unidos, que cobró fuerza el mes pasado, sigue a una ofensiva similar para tratar de excluir al gigante chino de equipos de telecomunicaciones Huawei Technologies de las redes de telecomunicaciones, pero que ha dado resultados mixtos. Como en el caso de Huawei, la campaña contra Nuctech se ha convertido en un test sobre la capacidad de los EEUU de persuadir a sus aliados para que no contraten a un proveedor de equipos más económico, justificando esas presiones en la preocupación de EEUU por la seguridad, unas preocupaciones que las compañías aseguran que son injustificadas.",LDOS,es,El Confidencial
