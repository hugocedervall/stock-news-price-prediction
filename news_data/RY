Sterling was little changed at $1.3191 as of 4:38 p.m on Monday in London.“The prospect of a no-deal exit still involves a substantial decline in sterling’s value, as the fragile U.K. economy experiences another downside shock that can’t be met with wide-sweeping fiscal stimulus measures, and is likely to involve negative rates from the Bank of England,” said Simon Harvey, a foreign-exchange analyst at Monex Europe.Leaving with no agreement at all would bring additional difficulties to businesses in the form of new trade barriers and quotas. The U.K. economy is already under strain, with growth further below its pre-crisis levels than any other Group-of-Seven economy.That said, the results were less pessimistic than data gathered from a similar survey in June, which showed respondents expected the pound to slump to $1.18 if there’s no deal.",RY,en,Yahoo Finance

As the CEO of a company that offers AI-backed software tailored to industries like oil and gas, banking, and manufacturing, Siebel has a first-hand view into companies' struggles, which he blames on the fact that corporations ""most frequently attempt to build the applications themselves with their own IT organization"" instead of enlisting outside help. ""Probably 99 out of 100 are failing and they're all internal build projects that involve sometimes hundreds of thousands of programmers,"" he said.

Key Quotes: “We anticipated a cautious tone from the Fed, in keeping with recent comments that suggest officials are comfortable with the current policy stance and see no immediate need to get back to raising rates. But today’s policy statement and projections were still more dovish than we expected—and what investors expected, based on the immediate market reaction.” “ Most notable is the shift in the Fed’s dot plot, which now shows a majority of FOMC members think the current rate setting will remain appropriate through the end of 2019. December’s dot plot had shown a median of two rate hikes were seen as appropriate this year. These new projections suggest the Fed’s base case is to leave policy steady this year—growth and/or inflation will have to surprise to the upside to warrant a return to tightening.”",RY,en,FXStreet
