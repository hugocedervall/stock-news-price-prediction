Then, in August, New Zealand’s stock market was forced to halt trading over four days in August after distributed-denial-of-service attacks overwhelmed its website. Then on October 1, another ""technical issue"" hit the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which resulted in an unprecedented all-day trading halt. And just a few weeks later, in late October, trading in all stocks and derivatives on Euronext NV markets was shut down for three hours affecting activity in countries including France and Belgium. The problem was traced to due to a software issue. Now, about a month later, the ""glitching"" rolling market blackout struck again, this time in Australia whose stock exchange opened for less than half an hour before a software issue forced it to close for the rest of Monday’s session, just as the country rolled out an ""updated"" trading system.",ASX,en,Zero Hedge

Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape on Friday called off negotiations with Exxon on the P'nyang field, blaming the energy giant for failing to budge on a proposed deal that was ""out of the money"". The expansion of liquefied natural gas exports is crucial for the impoverished Pacific nation, but is vying with several proposed LNG projects in Australia, Mozambique, Qatar, Russia and the United States. One of Exxon's partners in the PNG project, Oil Search Ltd , said on Monday the terms the government had sought would have made the project unprofitable. ""Under the terms proposed by the State, the joint venture partners were unable to obtain a return on their investment that made the project investable and bankable,"" Oil Search said in a statement to the Australian stock exchange.",ASX,en,The Sun Daily

A paywalled preview of the report claims Taiwan's Advanced Semiconductor Engineering will supply antenna-in-package technology for the 5G iPad, in addition to 5G iPhones. While not specified, it is almost certain that this model would be an iPad Pro given 5G is a high-end feature with higher production costs. While the first 5G iPhones are expected in fall 2020, the report does not indicate when the 5G iPad would be released. Major new features often come to the iPhone before the iPad, but a notable exception was the third-generation iPad receiving LTE support in March 2012 , prior to the iPhone 5 in September 2012 . mmWave or millimeter wave is a set of 5G frequencies that promise ultra-fast speeds at short distances, making it best suited for dense urban areas.
