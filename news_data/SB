2020-02-03 16:09:03-05:00,Dry Bulk Rates Poised To Hit A New All-Time Low,"The record for the absolute worst dry bulk shipping spot rate of all time was set in February 2016, when the Baltic Dry Index (BDI) slumped to 219 points and vessel spot rates were just $2,000 per day. Four years later, that ignominious record may about to be broken. The BDI is now in freefall, closing at 466 on Monday, down over 80% since September 2019. Rates for Capesize bulkers (vessels with capacity of around 180,000 deadweight tons) are now at around $3,500-4,000 per day — less than a third of breakeven rates in the low teens. The two most important routes for Capesizes are the Brazil-China and Australia-China iron-ore runs. These two lanes now face pressures on multiple fronts, implying that rates have further to fall. First, there's seasonal demand weakness. Second, Brazilian iron-ore export regions are suffering debilitating floods. Third, there are too many ships in Australia. Fourth, the IMO 2020 rule requires the use of more expensive low-sulfur fuel, slashing ship owner returns.","SB,SALT",en,Benzinga Feeds
