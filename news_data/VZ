Without that financial shot in the arm, Mozilla's 2019 financials looked much grimmer; for the second year running, Mozilla's expenses outweighed revenue. According to the 2019 financial statement released by the maker of the Firefox browser, Mozilla posted $338 million as ""Other revenue,"" a new line item that had not appeared in prior years' reporting. Elsewhere, Mozilla implicitly tied that amount to an earlier contract with Yahoo, which was purchased by Verizon in 2017. To read this article in full, please click here",VZ,en,ComputerWorld

2020-12-08 08:42:03-05:00,How advertisers are taking a page from Hollywood to reach consumers who are ignoring traditional ads,"Summary List Placement Last month, KitchenAid released its first documentary, ""A Woman's Place,"" a 30-minute film that follows three female chefs who overcome bias in the male-dominated culinary industry. ""We looked at a plethora of issues and landed on this because it ties really well to our brand purpose of creating possibility in the kitchen,"" said Robert Sundy, head of brand and creative at KitchenAid's parent company Whirlpool. ""There's an increasing expectation [from consumers] that brands have shared values and purpose —that's what drives loyalty and engagement."" KitchenAid isn't alone. The rising adoption of over-the-top streaming, growth of purpose-driven marketing, and increase in ad-skipping had led more brands to get on the documentary bandwagon. For instance: Brands including Nike, Johnson & Johnson, HP , and 23andMe have made documentaries in the past few years. Verizon started making its first documentaries in 2017, and has produced four, including two this year. P&G has prioritized long-form content in recent years, producing films such as ""The Talk"" and ""The Look."" Documentaries can help brands reach — and gain legitimacy — among hard-to-reach consumers The trend has accelerated in recent months as people stream more video the pandemic.",VZ,en,Business Insider

Thanks to positive vaccine news, the S&P 500 rose nearly 11% to deliver some of its best gains in the past 30 years while out-of-favor value stocks staged a massive comeback from their underperformance in the last decade or more. Since Pfizer's early November announcement that its vaccine had a 90%+ efficacy rate , Goldman Sachs' long/short value factor, which underperformed for most of the last four years, has surged 12% as of December 3, according to a Monday client note. For investors who have missed the value train, there are still other opportunities that have lagged the market but are well-positioned for the post-pandemic economy. Aside from cyclically oriented value stocks, S&P 500 dividend futures remain an attractive opportunity that trades at significant discounts, Chief US Equity Strategist David Kostin said in the note. While realized S&P 500 dividends per share fell by 5.6% year-over-year in the third quarter, many companies such as Darden Restaurants (DRI), Marathon Oil (MRO), and Estee Lauder (EL) that had suspended dividend payments earlier in the year due to COVID-19 impacts have now resumed, Kostin explained.",VZ,en,Business Insider

While telehealth has been on the brink of taking off for years, consumer usage of the tech ticked up slowly before 2020. The coronavirus pandemic has given consumers the push they need to adopt telemedicine on a wide scale — and we expect adoption to keep climbing so long as the pandemic rages on. Once outbreaks became severe in the US, consumers began flocking to telehealth: Telehealth usage among US adults climbed 6 percentage points month-over-month from February 2020 — when 11% of respondents reported having tried telehealth — to March — when 17% said the same, per a survey by CivicScience.",VZ,en,Business Insider

Perdue sold hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of these companies' stock shares during 2020, an Insider analysis of Senate stock trade disclosure records indicates. The senator also purchased either thousands or tens of thousands of dollars worth of these companies' shares.

President-elect Joe Biden has himself called for such censorship, including blocking President Donald Trump’s criticism of mail-in voting. Now, shortly after the election, one of Biden’s top aides is ramping up calls for a crackdown on Facebook for allowing Facebook users to read views that he considers misleading — users who signed up to hear from these individuals. Bill Russo, a deputy communications director on Biden’s campaign press team, tweeted late Monday that Facebook “is shredding the fabric of our democracy” by allowing such views to be shared freely. Russo tweeted that “If you thought disinformation on Facebook was a problem during our election, just wait until you see how it is shredding the fabric of our democracy in the days after.” Russo objected to the fact that, unlike Twitter, Facebook did not move against statements that he and the campaign viewed as “misleading.” He concluded . “We pleaded with Facebook for over a year to be serious about these problems.",VZ,en,Zero Hedge

The brand new Pixel 5 sells for $699 unlocked, an affordable but still high price tag for a mid-range Android phone. Best Buy’s deal offers at least $50 in instant savings for an unlocked handset, or $200 off when buying the phone with qualified activation. Google’s 2020 flagship phone is not really a flagship handset. Google made a huge compromise in the chip department , which allowed it to price the 5G phone at just $699.

The Pixel 5 gives you access to Google’s camera , which could benefit from a faster processor, and guaranteed fast Android updates for three years.

Alas, Quibi last week announced that it was shutting down. There has been no shortage of postmortem takes: Quibi's untimely demise has been attributed variously to the limitations of the mobile-only format, overly restrictive sharing functionality, and pandemic impacts on consumer viewing behavior.

This means you can have two lines of service on one iPhone, which is useful for purchasing data-only plans while traveling abroad or having personal and business lines on a single iPhone. 5G will not be available in Dual SIM mode on the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro at launch, however, according to an internal training document for Apple employees shared on Reddit . MacRumors can confirm that the document is authentic. From the document: ""Does 5G work with Dual SIM?"" When using two lines in Dual SIM mode, 5G data isn't supported on either line and will fall back to 4G LTE. If customers are using eSIM only and are on a 5G supported carrier and service plan, they'll have 5G access. According to an internal Verizon slide obtained by MacRumors, however, Apple plans to enable 5G support in Dual SIM mode with a software update later this year. In the meantime, Verizon says that eSIM customers must remove the physical SIM from their iPhone 12 or iPhone 12 Pro to access its 5G network. 5G is automatically enabled on iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro models, as long as users have chosen a supported wireless carrier that offers a 5G network.",VZ,en,Mac Rumors

While the promise of 5G networks is speedier connections, a private 5G network means more privacy and that a firm also wouldn't have to deal with anyone else using the network and slowing things down. This opens up a wealth of possibilities, like factories automating high-risk procedures without worrying about lag or hospitals sending sensitive medical information to labs securely. At the end of 2019, Deloitte analysts predicted that more than a hundred companies would experiment with private 5G networks by the end of this year. Companies like Ford and Honeywell are already testing them in their warehouses and factories to make processes more efficient. Now, a fresh-from-stealth startup called Celona wants to take a bite out of the 5G enterprise market, which market research firm Polaris estimates is worth $1.32 billion .

Any number of factors can affect how well you can keep your phone connected, so here are 10 things you can do to troubleshoot and improve your cell signal. How to boost your cell signal Get out from behind materials that block your signal. Cell signals are easily blocked, and so if you find your signal is weak, solving the problem might be as simple as moving outdoors. Reboot your cellular radio. Sometimes your phone can get confused and fail to lock onto the best cell tower. If you suspect a problem, turn your phone's Airplane Mode on and off, or just restart the phone entirely.

The issue lies with America's mobile carriers. AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile aren't totally up to speed on their 5G nationwide rollouts, leaving many users stuck on networks that are somewhat faster than 4G - but not as fast as 5G speeds that are theoretically 10 to 20 times faster. Apple, which is expected to unveil what analysts are calling the iPhone12 at a virtual event on Tuesday, will need to walk a tightrope between enticing consumers to upgrade their phones while not over-promising what 5G can do today. Getting U.S. mobile networks to deliver what is promised by 5G is still years away. That means developers haven't been in a rush to create apps for a 5G world.

Commercial Launches of 5G Networks From its earliest iterations to the Internet of Things, we’ve surpassed three generations of wireless networks. Now, 5G is at a tipping point. 5G is unique in that in order to actually start using the network, you need a device that works on it—unlike previous generations where they could simply switch over.

If you're interested in hacking and don't understand a lot of this, the TV show itself actually employs hackers to work on the show to depict real-life hacks that could happen in real life and it's a very very accurate portrayal of everything that we see in today. From being able to hack Smartphones to getting access to a big corporation and being able to bring them to their knees from a cyber perspective. So what's the top five things that you can do to make yourself more secure both at your business and your home? Number one, use two-factor authentication or two-step verification everywhere that you can. Your banking systems, Twitter, Facebook all support the ability for you to enable an additional security feature that you may not know. You go to your settings, it's in there. You can enable it and every time that you log in, it'll register your computer, and you can then get a text message to go into that system as a second form of verification.",VZ,en,Business Insider

The Lenovo Flex 5G is available right now through Verizon, and more 5G-capable laptops are on the way. But is now the right time to buy one? Sure, the idea of a 5G-enabled laptop is tempting.

That pretty much blows away the throughput on my home Wi-Fi network. Of course, you’ll only get those astounding 5G download speeds if you’re in a Verizon 5G coverage area, and as of now, they’re hard to come by.

After banning China's Huawei from its telecom network, the US government has been pushing big American companies such as Microsoft to get more involved with 5G – a technology which promises to enable everything from self-driving cars to remote surgery and more automated manufacturing. The new platform will be on Azure, Microsoft's flagship cloud computing business, and the company says it will reduce infrastructure costs, give flexibility to add services on demand and use artificial intelligence to automate operations. Yousef Khalidi, corporate vice president for Azure Networking, told Reuters that it could cut costs by 30%-40% in some cases.

2020-09-21 14:00:00-05:00,IBM's new service tells you exactly how much money your company's cybersecurity risks could cost – including in M&A deals with undisclosed data breaches (IBM),"Summary List Placement You don't have to look far for examples of cybersecurity's central role in business these days – whether it's in the high-profile TikTok acquisition talks, the ransomware payments organizations are increasingly threatened with, or the risks facing employee data while working remotely during the pandemic. Yet calculating the financial risk of cybersecurity vulnerability has historically been an inexact process – with big penalties. The price of Verizon's 2017 acquisition of Yahoo's internet business suddenly plunged $350 million when data breaches were discovered. From major acquisitions to minor data breaches, cybersecurity risk – put in dollars – has been difficult for companies to factor in. IBM says it is bringing new clarity and tools to the high-priced, sometimes murky world of cybersecurity risk on Tuesday with the announcement of new cybersecurity ""risk quantification services."" The company says the new services help companies systematically evaluate security risks – such as data breaches from an acquired company – the same way companies evaluate other budget items. ""Boards have wanted to understand whether they're spending enough money on cybersecurity"" and in the case of big data breaches, ""CEOs have wanted to know if they're going to appear on the front page of a newspaper tomorrow, and what are they doing to protect themselves,"" said Julian Meyrick, vice president of IBM Security. ""That conversation is not happening today in many organizations,"" Meyrick said.",VZ,en,Business Insider
2020-09-21 01:00:32-05:00,"Faster 5G is on its way, and here’s how we’ll get it","Some of America’s most productive farming starts in Washington, D.C. The Federal Communications Commission’s offices in the District don’t feature arable land, but they are where government regulators cultivate swaths of spectrum for use by wireless carriers. It’s not a fast process, but it’s essential to keep our bits flowing as smartphone use escalates while 5G wireless begins to connect many more devices beyond phones. And a round of upcoming auctions promises to fill the missing middle of that next-generation standard, making its faster speeds far more available—without requiring today’s smartphone shoppers to replace their newest purchases. What makes evolution in wireless possible is this opening up of greenfield spectrum,” says Harold Feld, senior vice president at the D.C.-based nonprofit policy group Public Knowledge . “Every time we’ve moved forward, we’ve had a bunch of auctions to create the new spectrum that we’re gonna need.” Starting in 2018, the FCC has mapped out a series of frequency bands that will be opened for 5G use in a series of auctions that should raise tens of billions of dollars for the federal government.",VZ,en,Fast Company

2020-09-16 10:52:07-05:00,Apple gave the FBI access to the iCloud account of a protester accused of setting police cars on fire (AAPL),"Summary List Placement As FBI officers were investigating a Seattle man suspected of setting police cars on fire, they turned to Apple for help. In response, Apple granted access to the man's iCloud account, giving the FBI access to screenshots, photos, and videos that are now central to their case against the suspect, court documents show. It's routine for Apple to comply with court-issued search warrants by handing over suspects' data to investigators. But the episode, detailed in court documents and previously reported by Forbes , shows just how valuable a suspect's smartphone data can be to an investigation, and contrasts with previous public clashes between the FBI and Apple. Federal prosecutors are now charging the suspect — Kelly Jackson of Edmonds, Washington — with two counts of arson and unlawful possession of a deadly device. Jackson is accused of throwing two Molotov cocktails that burned police cars during Seattle protests against police brutality in May.

The pandemic has accelerated cord cutting as the number of streaming services grows while advertisers cut linear TV budgets and rework big commitments with networks like NBCUniversal, Disney, and ViacomCBS. And AT&T — one of the biggest sellers of targeted, or so-called addressable advertising — is reportedly mulling spinning off its pay-TV service DirecTV and digital ad firm Xandr that was supposed to help it along. Addressable advertising has always represented a small amount of TV inventory, but the coronavirus has exposed some of its pitfalls like high ad prices, a lack of measurement standards, and growing competition from streaming TV companies. When the coronavirus shut down production schedules and sports, advertisers pulled their addressable campaigns along with national ad spend, said Matt Kramer, managing director of advanced advertising at Omnicom Media Group.",VZ,en,Business Insider

There's the super fast mmWave (millimeter wave) 5G and the slower but more widespread Sub-6GHz 5G. There have been mixed rumors about which ‌iPhone 12‌ models will support which 5G spectrums, but it appears that the fastest 5G technology could be limited to the higher-end ‌iPhone 12‌ Pro models, or even just the 6.7-inch version . This guide highlights the differences between mmWave and Sub-6GHz 5G to help you decide between the ‌iPhone 12‌ and 12 Pro models. mmWave vs. Sub6GHz Explained 5G is fifth-generation cellular wireless, succeeding the 4G LTE networks that we've been connecting to since 2010.

Why would it? After going nearly straight up for the last five months, it’s only natural for there to be a pullback. This was particularly true for technology stocks. They’d reached such dizzying heights it was just a matter of time before the thin air got to them. And get to them it did. Some of the mania’s favorites, like Apple, Tesla, and Nvida, fainted in unison…dropping 8 percent, 9 percent, and 9.3 percent, respectively. A company called PagerDuty garnered the honor of the day’s biggest loser. The San Francisco based company, which operates in the cloud, made a graceful 25.8 percent swan dive from its heavenly realm. So, what should you do about it? Should you buy the dip? As far as we can tell, there’s currently no fundamental reason to buy stocks.

""The modern media company [has] everything to do with the combination of content, distribution, data and technology,"" Brian Lesser, an ad agency vet who was brought on to carry out this plan, explained in 2018. ""AT&T alone has the components to solve this problem."" The mantra was, bigger was better. The idea was that by melding data, distribution, and content, AT&T could juice its slowing core wireless business, because there are only so many phone services people can sign up for, and take on Facebook and Google's dominance of digital advertising. In short order, AT&T acquired DirecTV for $48.5 billion, Time Warner for $84.5 billion, and digital ad company AppNexus for $1.6 billion. Lesser has since left AT&T, and AT&T is reportedly hanging a for-sale sign on assets outside its core telco business, including its digital ad business Xandr and streaming service Crunchyroll .",VZ,en,Business Insider

So roughly 9% is banks’ NPAs right now. It can add another 6% to 7% more. Axis has been one bank where the CEO has been very transparent. For the last three months, he has been saying it is better to go for one-time restructuring so that the bank’s capital does not get impacted. Even Uday Kotak made that point that Rs 100 lakh crores is the bank’s outstanding assets and the outstanding loans that they have given and the capital is about Rs 11-12 lakh crore.

The first discount of $5 kicks in after three months, while the second discount of $10 activates after nine months. This comes just a few weeks after AT&T launched pricing options for its prepaid service, in which subscribers receive a lower monthly rate by prepaying for either three months or a full year of service. These pricing features will help AT&T and Verizon attract prepaid subscribers who can become profitable long-term customers. Relative to postpaid plans, prepaid plans tend to attract more price-sensitive, less loyal customers. So while wireless carriers could grow their base of prepaid customers by undercutting competitors on price, this strategy isn't necessarily effective, because those customers are more likely to leave once they find a better deal.

Later this year, the company hopes to bring lower-priced devices to other markets, including North America and Europe. The ultimate goal is to sell a lot of phones with lower price tags, then spin them into an ecosystem of connected devices. “We can look at it as having a more affordable product offering,” Lau says through an interpreter, “but all products that still remain up to the OnePlus standard . . . and through this enabling, more people to have access to OnePlus products.” Back to roots Six years ago, cheapness put OnePlus on the map.",VZ,en,Fast Company

It's by no means a widespread network that everyone can connect to. Progress and innovation like 5G is good, and it's not unusual that it costs more. But, what's the point of paying for 5G tech if you can't connect to it yet? If Android phones of 2020 are looking too expensive for your taste, you can opt for slightly older and less expensive Android phones that don't come with 5G to hold you over until 5G becomes mainstream rather than novelty. I especially recommend the $500 OnePlus 7T from 2019. Android phone makers are coming out with some great smartphones in 2020 so far, but 5G is ruining the party. Indeed, 5G is making phones more expensive than ever before, where 5G tech like mobile processors, modems, and antennas are adding up to $200 extra to what smartphones used to cost in 2019.

2020-05-11 15:31:00-05:00,"Motorola Edge Plus review: A good try, but not enough to recommend against Apple, Samsung, and OnePlus phones","Motorola's $1,000 Edge Plus smartphone is good, but it's not good enough to steal your eyes from Apple, Samsung, or OnePlus phones. The main things going for it are its powerful specs, which are albeit common in high-end phones. The phone also has very effective cameras. Its screen is too curved, however, and its design doesn't have the final polish that's expected on such an expensive smartphone. And, if you're not a Verizon customer, you might as well click away — this phone is a Verizon exclusive, and it's not worth switching for. You're better off with the OnePlus 8 Pro if you need to buy a new phone in 2020. The Motorola Edge Plus goes on sale on May 14. Motorola is back to making high-end smartphones, which I thoroughly appreciate. The high-end smartphone category is in dire need of competition — it's primarily populated by only two companies in the US: Apple and Samsung. For those ""in-the-know,"" the phone of choice is anything from OnePlus. The only other company that was competing at all in the US was LG, but those phones have lost almost all of their appeal.",VZ,en,Business Insider

To answer their question, Goldman has put together a real-time reopening scale which, since no fundamental or economic data matter, will soon become the top market-moving indicator for the US stock market. * * * One month ago, when most of the US was still behind the curve on the first wave of the corona pandemic, Goldman published a ""lockdown index"" to keep track of where on the spectrum, so to speak, various US states and country in general were to be found. One month later, the usefulness of this index appears to have peaked as markets now only care about the ""reopening"" - at least until the second coronavirus infection wave hits - and as cities and states across the U.S. begin to reverse lockdown measures at different paces and with different processes in place, Goldman has introduced a new index and weekly series that will measure the pace this reopening is happening by looking at a wide range of data from “Stay at Home” (food delivery, eCommerce, streaming media, grocery sales, etc.) to “Back to Normal” (commuting, box office, travel, etc.) and business activity (freight, housing, equipment sales, etc).","VZ,W",en,Zero Hedge

AT&T and T-Mobile's unlimited plans are also quality, and offer different perks that might be a better fit for you. For example, T-Mobile has the best international perks, and AT&T offers an incredible amount of unrestricted data.

When deciding which unlimited phone plan is the best, there is one undeniable and objective factor that must be considered, even beyond how much unrestricted data you get in the plan. That factor is coverage . Quite simply, coverage is the most important thing in a mobile phone network. It doesn't matter how much unlimited data you have if you can't use it where you live, where you work, or where you're going. And, if we're talking about unlimited data plans, we're specifically looking for 4G LTE coverage — the most widely available mobile network with speeds suited for data-heavy things like streaming videos and music, shopping online, or browsing the web and social media.",VZ,en,Business Insider

2020-02-21 09:58:19-05:00,Dish's $10 billion 5G build-out budget likely won't be enough to build a standalone cellular network,"Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen used the company's Q4 earnings call to address analysts' concerns that $10 billion would not be enough to build a standalone cellular network. As a condition of T-Mobile acquiring Sprint, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) required Dish to build a standalone network that covers 20% of the US population by 2022. While skeptics have pointed to the far higher network build-out costs of other US carriers, Ergen said he believed they failed to account for technical debt — the costs associated with maintaining old equipment and ensuring backward compatibility. Operations costs, Ergen said , would also be reduced because Dish intends to employ new automation technologies and cloud-based networking. Furthermore, Dish would utilize OpenRAN , a telecommunication standard that makes it easier for network operators to supply components from multiple vendors. While the factors Ergen cited will undoubtedly lead to cost savings, there is still reason to doubt Dish's $10 billion budget will be enough.",VZ,en,Business Insider

This follows on the heels of the decision earlier this week in the protracted antitrust lawsuit against the proposed merger, which ruled in favor of T-Mobile and cleared the merger to move past one of its final hurdles. For context, since the merger's announcement in April 2018, Sprint has seen declines in both revenue and subscribers — at the end of Sprint's fiscal Q3 2019 (ended December 31, 2019), the company reported subscribers losses for six straight quarters and posted the company's fifth consecutive quarterly revenue net loss. Despite these disappointing financial outcomes, Sprint's controlling shareholder SoftBank opposes a renegotiation, which could risk drawing out the almost two-year-long merger process even further and negatively affect T-Mobile. A further extension of the merger timeline could hurt T-Mobile's growth plans, just as previous delays have already eaten into its business.",VZ,en,Business Insider

The Galaxy S20+ and Galaxy S20 Ultra will have mmWave support, but the base-tier S20 will only support the Sub-6 5G. mmWave spectrum supports faster data speeds over a smaller coverage area; by comparison, sub-6 has a wider coverage area but sacrifices data transmission speeds.

Sprint chose not to participate in either preceding auction, while AT&T spent $982 million across the two auctions, T-Mobile spent $842, and Verizon spent $520 million, according to Light Reading. Sprint's choice to abstain from mmWave was likely informed by its faith that the T-Mobile merger will go through, despite facing steep hurdles.

2020-01-30 10:12:46-05:00,AT&T plans to intertwine its media and connectivity businesses after mediocre Q4 2019 earnings,"US telecom giant AT&T's Q4 2019 earnings disclosed disappointing results while also outlining a strategy for future growth. The second-largest US wireless carrier by volume, AT&T collected $36.5 billion in revenue, 1.9% less than its Q4 2018 revenue. During the quarter, the company also gained 3.6 million new wireless customers, down more than 5% year-over-year (YoY) from 3.8 million in Q4 2018. Additionally, the company experienced a higher rate of customer churn at 1.29%, up from 1.23% in Q4 2018. Amid these mediocre results, AT&T laid out its vision for the next few years, with both short- and long-term plans. Here's what AT&T intends to accomplish in the next year: In 2020, the company plans to turn its massive investments into sources of revenue. AT&T plans to establish nationwide 5G coverage by mid-2020, a costly endeavor — in July 2019, the company spent almost $1 billion on 5G spectrum alone at an FCC auction. Building a nationwide 5G network will expand the addressable audience for AT&T's service, which launched in December 2019 in just 10 US cities — by comparison, rival Verizon finished 2019 with 5G service in over 30 cities, after launching commercial 5G in April 2019.",VZ,en,Business Insider

Power's annual performance study finds Verizon customers experience the fewest network interruptions,"Verizon customers experienced the fewest network interruptions compared with customers on all other major networks in the six US regions covered by J.D. Power's annual US Wireless Network Performance Study. The metric reflects the prevalence of network performance issues per 100 connections across call, messaging, and data quality. Of the Big Four US carriers, Verizon posted the fewest performance issues in all six regions, with a nationwide average of 7.7 issues per 100 connections, followed by T-Mobile (10), AT&T (11), and Sprint (12.8). To maintain this network quality in the 5G era, Verizon needs to acquire spectrum that is currently in limited supply. Verizon's messaging to US consumers centers around its network quality, as it claims to have the ""nation's largest, most reliable 4G LTE network."" But the carrier's ability to replicate its 4G network quality in the 5G era remains uncertain: While Verizon had the largest holding of mmWave spectrum as of 2019, it notably lacks mid- and low-band spectrum that will be critical to offering 5G service outside of big cities, where mmWave deployments work best.",VZ,en,Business Insider

That is truly staggering, but from our perspective, it's also potentially a bit troubling. Why? Because so many millions of people have subscribed to Disney+, it's inevitable that many of them are paying for the service despite the fact that they can get it for free.

After pausing the 5G Home rollout in January 2019, the telecom relaunched the service in October 2019 using the 5G NR industry standard — but it now faces challenges scaling the service.

Verizon has targeted drone connectivity since October 2016, when it first announced its intention to sell wireless data plans for the emerging technology. Just a few months later, the company deepened its commitment to the drones by purchasing drone operation company Skyward. Now, the telecom sees the segment as a potential core revenue stream for its 5G network, which is now available in 31 markets following the launch in April 2019. A 5G network like Verizon's can boost the utility of drones in a number of ways: 5G will enable drones to transmit high-definition footage in real-time. 5G's millisecond latency and data speeds up to 100 times faster than 4G allows drones to transmit high-quality footage to operators on the ground. This enables drones to be used for functions like infrastructure safety inspections, where the drone operator must be able to see patches of rust or smalls cracks, for instance.",VZ,en,Business Insider

Giving corporate telecom giants this power is wildly unpopular among the American people , who know that these companies have overcharged customers and interfered with users’ internet access in the past. However, people who advocate for an open internet, free of corporate roadblocks, might find solace in another aspect of the court’s ruling: States and local governments may be able to mandate their own net neutrality rules . The effort is underway Governors in six states—Hawaii, Montana, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont—have already signed executive orders enforcing net neutrality by prohibiting state agencies from doing business with internet service providers that limit customers’ online access.",VZ,en,Fast Company

The company pledged nearly $803 million in bids for 1,346 mmWave (24 GHz) licenses, placing it just behind AT&T, which agreed to pay over $982 million for 831 licenses. T-Mobile also pledged $39 billion in bids for 865 mmWave (28GHz) licenses. Having a sufficient amount of spectrum in the mmWave band for 5G networks is important because the frequency range provides the fastest wireless connection speeds, but only over shorter distances, making it ideal for densely populated urban areas that require high-capacity and data-intensive 5G applications. Here's what it means: T-Mobile's spending spree highlights the carrier's attempt to vastly increase its 5G network's speed and capacity. T-Mobile was previously lagging behind Verizon and AT&T in licensed mmWave spectrum — which influenced its 5G strategy.

The new chipset combines the company's Helio M70 5G modem, ARM's recently announced Cortex-A77 CPU, Mali-G77 CPU, and Mediatek's most advanced AI processing unit.

2019-05-11 11:37:29-05:00,Uber had the worst first-day dollar loss ever of any US IPO,"Uber started trading on Friday in an initial public offering that valued the company at $75.5 billion. By the end of day Friday, the stock was trading down 6.7% off the $45 a share, where the company had priced on Thursday night . With a cumulative loss of $655 million , it's the worst first-day dollar loss of a US IPO. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. The much-anticipated Uber initial public offering managed to break a record, but not one that investors would've hoped for. The stock closed down 6.7% on its opening day to $41.70, down from the $45 a share the company priced at on Thursday night ahead of the IPO that had valued the company at $75.5 billion. In total, the discount off the IPO price meant that investors who got in at that price saw a cumulative loss of $655 million . By the end of day Friday, Uber had a market cap of $69.7 billion, far below the $120 billion valuation figure bankers had suggested in 2018.

2019-05-09 03:00:04-05:00,The Corporate World Has Its Own Inequality Problem,"(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- Liberals have a blind spot about inequality. They decry disparity between individuals—the fact, for example, that the 10 richest people in America have more money than the bottom 160 million. But they overlook inequality among companies, instead viewing Big Business as a troublesome monolith. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont occasionally tarred business with a broad brush, once saying the chiefs of large multinational companies “ain’t going to like me.” The surprising truth is there’s as much inequality among large companies as there is among people. As with individuals, a handful of companies make the lion’s share of profits, while struggling companies do so poorly they actually destroy value for their shareholders and debtholders. In the middle is a stressed-out majority: unable to keep up with the best, while pressured by the desperate tactics of the worst. Inequality in the corporate world isn’t new. Perfect competition—with millions of small, roughly equal businesses battling it out on a level playing field—was never more than a teaching device in intro economics textbooks.",VZ,en,Bloomberg

2019-05-01 08:03:38-05:00,Verizon is taking a temporary break from its plans to charge an additional $10 per month for its mobile 5G service (VZ),"Verizon is taking a temporary break from its plans to charge an additional $10 per month for its mobile 5G service, according to company statements, per Bloomberg. Previously, Verizon planned to waive the $10 charge for only the first three months. Here's what it means: Verizon is seeking to better lure customers to its 5G service. The carrier is already providing incentives to make it easier to upgrade. It's offering a $200 prepaid Mastercard card to customers who purchase a Galaxy S10 5G device and sign up for Verizon Unlimited. Additionally, those who pre-order the Galaxy S10 5G device will receive a free pair of Galaxy Buds and a Samsung Wireless Charging Battery Pack, and are eligible for up to $650 off. But offering free access to 5G plans is likely the most promising incentive. Less than one-third (31%) of consumers are willing to pay more for mobile 5G and, on average, they'd only be willing to pay an extra $4.40 a month, according to a survey by PWC. And given that Verizon already has the most expensive unlimited plans, waiving the $10 fee might help customers make the leap to 5G.",VZ,en,Business Insider

The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced it's adjusting the way it penalizes violations of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) by shifting its focus to health firms' ""level of culpability."" Organizations that took necessary measures to comply with HIPAA but were still breached will be hit with smaller fines than those that knowingly violated HIPAA. Here's what it means: Health firms have called for changes to HIPAA, as compliant organizations have had to shell out millions in government fees. US health firms suffered a record 365 data breaches in 2018, up from 358 in 2017. And the government doled out an all-time high of nearly $29 million in HIPAA penalties in 2018, per the HIPAA journal. While these fees are designed to encourage organizations to increase cybersecurity investments, health firms contend that the steep fines may cause organizations to underinvest, since they're penalized regardless of their efforts to develop countermeasures.",VZ,en,Business Insider

As US consumers hold onto their phones for longer, AT&T and Verizon are feeling the burn: AT&T's device upgrade rate dropped to 3.5% year-over-year (YoY), and Verizon's device upgrade rate fell to 4.4% YoY. Here's what it means: There are two chief trends lengthening the US smartphone upgrade cycle, and in turn, pulling down AT&T's and Verizon's smartphone upgrade figures. The average price consumers are paying for smartphones is rising. In 2018, the average selling price of smartphones is expected to have increased more than 10% from 2017. As the price of smartphones continues to climb, consumers may be less willing to shell out the cash for a new model. Premium phones lack new, generation-specific features.

Sprint — which is set to launch its mobile 5G network in four cities next month — outlined its strategy to make its network more usable and accessible at NYU's annual 5G summit on April 24, according to PC Mag. The carrier's strategy relies on the use of dual connectivity — simultaneous 4G and 5G network connections — and the mid-band 2.5GHz spectrum. Here's what it means: Sprint likely perceives the use of dual connectivity as well as its reliance on a 2.5GHz spectrum as its two biggest initial competitive advantages in the 5G space. Sprint will be the first carrier in the US to rely on 5G's dual connectivity capability. The capability allows phones to combine 5G and 4G networks to enable faster download speeds. This could make the user experience smoother with fewer interruptions than competitors like AT&T and Verizon, which use 4G to establish a 5G phone's initial connection and don't yet enable dual connectivity downloads.",VZ,en,Business Insider

US telecoms like Verizon still lag their Chinese rivals when it comes to 5G. So, in a series of tweets sent Thursday morning, President Trump exclaimed that ""I want 5G, and even 6G technology in the United States as soon as possible"" and demanded that ""American companies must step up their efforts."" I want 5G, and even 6G, technology in the United States as soon as possible. It is far more powerful, faster, and smarter than the current standard.

Arthur Robert Firstenberg is an American author and an activist for electromagnetic radiation and health. In his 1997 book Microwaving Our Planet: The Environmental Impact of the Wireless Revolution , he claimed: “The telecommunications industry has suppressed damaging evidence about its technology since at least 1927.” Firstenberg has also founded the independent campaign group the Celluar Phone Task Force and since 1996 he has argued in numerous publications that wireless technology is dangerous. According to a report by the Daily Star, Firstenberg has also recently started an online petition calling on world organizations, such as the United Nations, World Health Organisation (WHO), and European Union to “urgently halt the development of 5G,” which is due to be rolled out this year.",VZ,en,Zero Hedge

2019-01-11 23:25:00-05:00,AT&T Stops Selling Location Data Of Americans To Bounty Hunters,"After Motherboard gave a bounty hunter a phone number and a few hundred bucks, their contact responded with a screenshot of Google Maps, containing a highlighted circle indicating the phone’s exact location. Motherboard then released a report on Tuesday, showing how T-Mobile, Sprint, and AT&T are selling their customers’ location data, and some of that data was ending up in the hands of bounty hunters and unauthorized people, letting them track virtually any phone in the US. In a swift response to the report, several senators requested the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to investigate, and demanded greater oversight and regulation of the telecommunications industry. On Thursday, AT&T released a statement indicating that it is halting the sale of all location data to so-called location aggregators, firms that sit in the supply chain between the telcos and clients. ""In light of recent reports about the misuse of location services, we have decided to eliminate all location aggregation services - even those with clear consumer benefits,"" AT&T said in a statement. ""We are immediately eliminating the remaining services and will be done in March."" Some companies use the location data service for legitimate purposes, such as roadside assistance to find stranded customers, or financial companies to detect fraud.",VZ,en,Zero Hedge
