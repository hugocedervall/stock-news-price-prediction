2020-12-07 09:35:09-05:00,McKinsey says COVID-19 is just one of many supply-chain disruptions CEOs need to prepare for going forward,"Summary List Placement The coronavirus was the first major shock to the intricate network of supply chains that keep the auto industry humming since the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011. Fukushima hit Japanese car production hard because factories in that region of the country were supplying factories around the world, including in the US. Honda and Toyota recovered relatively quickly, but the accident spurred a discussion about how to improve the resilience of supply chains, the management of which is critical to a globalized system of ""just in time"" manufacturing, where companies maintain lean inventories and calibrate production to match demand. No one talked enough, however, to prepare for the coronavirus pandemic. In late 2019 and early 2020, the virus idled auto manufacturing in China, the world's largest market, before later shutting down North America and Europe for more than a month. Going beyond resiliency Carmakers are still grappling with the ongoing impact of revamping their operations to stress worker safety, and those moves have extended to the convoluted supply chain that feeds into the assembly plants. ""Resilience is not a new topic,"" Asutosh Padhi, a senior partner in McKinsey & Company's Chicago office who works with industrial clients, told Business Insider. ""But for the first time, in 2020 100% of company boards have had a discussion about resilience in supply chains."" Zeroing in on supply chains has indeed become a priority for the leadership of the world's largest companies. ""I am spending more time anticipating where new issues may surface, and trying to get ahead of them to the extent possible to ensure we continue to support our employees and customers,"" Alicia Boler Davis, Amazon's VP of global customer fulfillment, told Business Insider earlier this year . ""This is a CEO-level topic that's transformational,"" Padhi said. ""Everybody has been to the emergency room.","AMZN,TM",en,Business Insider

For starters, the auto industry is huge: More than a billion passenger vehicles are roaming the planet, with another 80 million or so joining them every year. No single victor could satisfy that level of demand. This was obvious even in the early days of the auto industry, when scores of carmakers, engine-makers, and coachbuilders were competing to put Americans and Europeans behind the wheel. Yes, there were obvious winners and losers: Henry Ford captured a huge amount of market share early on with his Model T, then General Motors grew itself into a competitor and took the lead. But more than a century on, both are carrying on, more or less fine. That's not how races work. In the 20th century, plenty of other famous names got in on the action.

After being snubbed in September, the carmaker has just joined an enviable financial club — and instantly became one of the 10 biggest holdings in the index. The upshot of this momentous event is twofold. First, the short case against Tesla, already shot after the company went on an epic rally at the start of 2020, is now hopeless. Far more investors are going to be passively long Tesla's stock simply because index funds will buy the S&P, and Tesla with it. Second, Tesla's ability to raise additional capital by issuing new shares should encounter little resistance, now that inclusion in the S&P 500 has effectively priced the company to perfection, at a market capitalization of around $400 billion. Basically, it's now safe to stop fretting about Tesla.

Most manufacturing companies still run most of their applications on-premises, but Gartner predicts that by the end of 2026, at least 80% of manufacturers worldwide will have adopted cloud applications built specifically for their industry. AWS, Microsoft, and Google Cloud have already devoted vast resources to winning over manufacturing customers, moving them over to the cloud, and building cloud products specially tailored for that industry. ""All of the cloud providers are investing in this space,"" Forrester principal analyst Paul Miller told Business Insider. As Google Cloud works to catch up to AWS and Microsoft in the cloud, it hired a former Accenture director — Suchitra Bose — as the new director of process manufacturing. Bose, who previously led Accenture's digital manufacturing and operations practice, will develop Google Cloud's manufacturing industry strategy , focusing on sales, partnerships, customer support, and more. ""[Google] sees this opportunity and sees their competitors have developed a beachhead first,"" Gartner senior research director Rick Franzosa told Business Insider.

From Austin to Houston, polls suggest that Joe Biden may be within striking distance of President Trump - something which hasn't happened in Texas since 1976.

Almost 8.5 million Texans had cast ballots by Wednesday, representing about 95% of the entire vote in 2016 .

In an automotive industry increasingly driven by consolidation, where not even major operations like Chrysler, Fiat, Nissan, and Mitsubishi can find a path forward without joining together in elaborate networks of takeovers and mergers, smaller concerns have also had to forge similar partnerships lest they be swallowed whole by red ink or a deep-pocketed competitor.

Automakers have reported 3-5 percent driven by increased need for personal mobility and an additional car in the family.While the overall women ownership of cars is in the range of 15-18% in India, this is set to increase as women increasingly get behind the wheel for events such as off-roading and adventure trails.

TRI is concerned about the upcoming worldwide demographic Armageddon . From 2020-2040, growth will be flat among the child-bearing population. Meanwhile, 40-70-year-olds will rise in total population size, but 70-80-year-olds, and particularly the 80+-year-olds, will see large increases. The older population's future surge will be a demographic timebomb that will strain many western economies. TRI believes it could alleviate some of the pressure by providing at-home robots to assist older generations. TRI recently offered the world a glimpse into a mock-up home environment built in its labs in California, where it has been testing its prototype robots. One of the robots it's testing is called the ""gantry robot,"" which is suspended from the ceiling and can complete basic kitchen tasks like cleaning dishes.

2020-10-05 11:32:04-05:00,Car cos to seek reimbursement if Brexit fails,"TOKYO: apan's two biggest automakers, Toyota and Nissan, will ask Britain to reimburse them for additional custom charges incurred if the UK government fails to reach a Brexit trade deal with the European Union, the Nikkei financial daily reported on Monday.The companies - Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co Ltd - want payments to cover the additional 10% tax on automobile imports from Britain that the EU would impose should Britain crash out of the EU without an agreement, the Nikkei said, without citing sources.Officials for the carmakers declined to comment on the report, though Nissan expressed concern about the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on its business.""We urge UK and EU negotiators to work collaboratively towards an orderly, balanced Brexit that will continue to encourage mutually beneficial trade,"" Nissan said.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Sunday that he did not particularly want the Brexit transition period, which runs until the end of the year, to run out without a trade deal in place, but that Britain could live with such an outcome.The Nikkei report, however, underscores how a failure to agree a new trading relationship could prompt foreign companies operating in Britain to reconsider the viability of operations in the face of extra tariffs that erode profitability, and customs checks and regulations that slowed operations.Toyota operates a plant in Derbyshire, central England, and produced roughly 8% of the 1.52 million cars made in Britain in 2018.",TM,en,Economic Times India

2020-10-04 22:42:53-05:00,Is going private a bad idea for SoftBank?,"By Pavel AlpeyevInside SoftBank Group Corp., the idea of going private through a buyout has been discussed off and on for at least five years. Almost everyone except founder Masayoshi Son opposes it, people with direct knowledge of the matter said.The reasons are substantial: No one has pulled off a buyout anywhere close to SoftBank’s $130 billion valuation, it’s not clear the company could raise the necessary financing and such a complex deal would prove a distraction for at least a year, the people said. Senior managers also worry that without public shareholders, it would be harder to keep Son’s wildest impulses in check, one person said.That doesn’t mean a deal is out of the question. The Japanese conglomerate considered buying out shareholders and retreating from the public market again this year, the people said. Son has been frustrated that SoftBank’s market capitalization continues to fall far short of the value of his holdings, particularly Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.Preliminary work on a buyout got under way after a record drop in SoftBank shares in March, but the effort was later tabled as the stock price more than doubled with asset sales, buybacks and media reports about a possible deal, one person said.","TMUS,TM",en,Economic Times India

In addition to the financial penalty, the commission has also directed the parties to cease and desist from implementing the agreed parts trade discount and the hourly labour rates, and subsequently such discounts and rates will be determined independently by individual insurers and workshops. MyCC found that PIAM and the insurers had infringed the Competition Act 2010 in relation to an arrangement between PIAM and the Federation of Automobile Workshop Owners’ Association of Malaysia (FAWOAM) on the minimum hourly labour rates and spare part prices for six commonly used vehicles, namely, Proton, Perodua, Naza, Nissan, Toyota and Honda.

While it’s difficult to see who exactly is buying the ETPs, long or short, Rhind noted that coming into the earnings announcement, they were selling six times the amount of shorts to longs. Part of that might be a hedging technique: Rhind also reports enquiries from holders of the Baillie Gifford flagship investment trust, The Scottish Mortgage Trust, which has Tesla as its number one holding at 12.7 per cent of the portfolio. “People might be thinking the share price has gone too far,” Rhind says, but Tesla continues to confound sceptics, despite comments from CEO Elon Musk who commented on the results, saying: “We want to be, like, slightly profitable and maximise growth and make the cars as affordable as possible, and that's what we're trying to achieve.” The company earned a profit of USD104 million during the quarter, compared to a loss of USD408 million for the same quarter a year ago.",TM,en,ETF Express

Is that something that you would now factor in given that you have said all this while that pockets will continue to be resilient?I think on the pain front, it is relatively clear what the pecking order is. For example, if you look at Nestle or ITC sales, they are back to normal. If you go one notch up from essentials, the semi-essentials like undergarments, paints and adhesives are back to 70-80% of normal levels. It is only in sectors like trucks and cars where normality is still some distance away. Even in the auto sector, two wheelers seem to be up 80% of normal demand and even tractor demand is roaring across the country.

That dominance is waning, though. Last year, renewable-powered electricity in the U.S. surpassed coal-fired power, and two of the largest coal retirements slated for 2020 are in Kentucky . Meanwhile, in a striking bit of energy transition symbolism, the state’s Coal Mining Museum, located in a historical coal town called Benham, made the switch to solar as a cost-cutting measure back in 2017. “It is a little ironic,” museum spokesperson Brandon Robinson told local TV station WYMT at the time. “Of course, coal is still king around here.” The museum’s decision is unlikely to be the predominant one in Kentucky. Though coal is steadily losing its crown, new natural gas combined cycle plants will remain more economic than building large-scale solar projects in some parts of Kentucky for the next couple years. However, solar developers are inching into the state, teasing out deals and working to gain access to the lucrative PJM market, in part driven by demand from corporate consumers. “With the cost of solar continuing to decline [and the] corporate renewables market continuing to grow and expand, it’s just natural that any state that has a policy framework that allows power to be sold between a solar farm and a corporate offtaker … is going to start to grow,” said Carson Harkrader, CEO at Carolina Solar Energy, a North Carolina-based company that began sniffing around Kentucky in 2018.",TM,en,Green Technology

There's been a lot of buzz lately around facial recognition technology, an artificial intelligence system that identifies individuals by comparing 2D or 3D images from a digital photo or video frame with pre-stored images in a database.

There’s plenty of blame to go around: relatively cheap gas, expiring federal EV tax credits for Tesla and GM, the dearth of available electric trucks and SUVs, higher upfront costs compared to conventional vehicles. But the auto industry is itself partially to blame for last year’s stagnant market. Despite automakers’ frequent pronouncements proclaiming electric vehicles as the future of mobility, they haven’t fully deployed their considerable resources to market and sell EVs. How can one conclude Americans aren’t interested in EVs when automakers barely advertise them, dealers sparingly stock them, and many salespeople remain indifferent if not hostile to selling them? Results from a recently published Sierra Club report confirm the dismal state of the EV buying experience in the United States ( PDF ). In a first-of-its-kind survey, nearly 600 volunteers visited more than 900 auto dealerships and stores across all 50 states and found that 74 percent of dealerships do not have a single EV on their lot for sale.",TM,en,Green Technology

According to Moody's, the global demand for light vehicles will remain sluggish amid weakening economic growth in key markets. Expecting the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) in China and advanced G-20 countries, Moody's said the negative outlook for the sector is based on its forecast of 0.9 per cent decline in light vehicle sales following a projected 3.8 per cent decline in 2019.

The customers will see through it and it just becomes a gimmicky thing,” he said.“We will do totally independent products; if you didn’t know it, you wouldn’t know that both products are based on a common architecture. Both companies can retain their own DNA and be differentiated, yet share a lot in common,” he added.For the overseas market, however, the US partner is considering using Mahindra products and re-badge them as Ford to expand its emerging market business, Goenka said.To be sure, attempts at crossbadging by the Volkswagen Group with Vento and the Rapid sedan, or the Renault-Nissan alliance with Duster and Terrano SUV, and the recent effort by Maruti Suzuki and Toyota to rebadge the Baleno hatchback as Toyota Glanza has impacted the individual brands.As product lifecycles shrink and the novelty of new products wane within six months, vehicle makers have had to constantly upgrade and launch new products.Goenka said the JV will help accelerate product launches and plug gaps in its portfolio.It was announced earlier that a ‘C segment’ SUV based on the new generation Mahindra XUV 500 architecture — codenamed W601 — will be shared with Ford, which is internally calling it as W605.",TM,en,The Economic Times India

2019-11-15 13:21:53-05:00,The real reason why investments are not looking up for India,"By Abheek BaruaA comprehensive explanation of why the private investment pipeline continues to run dry has to look beyond the usual suspects, like low capacity utilisation and weak demand. The fact that investors are holding back because they have spare capacity is an empty tautology. What we need to figure out is why this capacity is spare.It’s best to get a couple of things out of the way at this stage. The claim that demand is somehow ‘saturated’ for a number of products is misleading. Take cars and trucks, the segment worst hit by the current slowdown. A cross-country analysis of vehicle ownership done by HDFC Bank shows that even at its current per-capita income levels, India’s vehicle ownership falls below the curve.So, even if India’s growth were to slow to zero, vehicle ownership should, at least in theory, increase. To put this in context, Brazil and China are over-penetrated. For them, saturation is a problem.The second caveat relates to identifying the cost and availability of funds as a constraint for investments.",TM,en,The Economic Times India

Consumer Reports measures reliability by analyzing survey responses from vehicle owners who are asked to list the problems their vehicle has had in the past year and whether they were serious. Tesla's rise in the ranking suggests the company's production quality, which has long been an issue, is improving.

But, the company's third quarter results easily beat up estimates despite the $1 billion strike cost for the quarter. This national strike was the longest in almost 50 years.

Third Quarter Results Revenue of $35.47 billion exceeded the forecasts of $33.82 billion resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $1.72 versus the expected $1.31. The strike has taken 52% per share of the company's earnings whereas the revaluation of its investment in Lyft Inc (NASDAQ: LYFT ) and warrants from PSA Group deducted an additional 15 cents per share.

Some of the meetings resulted in prompt decisions including sending instructions to top government officials, the people said, without giving any specific examples. They said the general was concerned about restoring confidence among the business community.An army spokesman declined to comment when asked about the meetings, however on Thursday the military issued a statement after Bajwa hosted a gathering of government economic officials and business leaders on Wednesday.“National security is intimately linked to economy while prosperity is function of balance in security needs and economic growth,” Bajwa said in the statement.The military, which has staged numerous coups since Pakistan’s founding in 1947, has seen a direct impact from the economic slowdown: Defense spending was frozen in the 2020 fiscal year budget for the first time in more than a decade.",TM,en,The Economic Times India

The sun, on the other hand, shines everywhere for free, and when that energy is paired with enough battery capacity to propel automobiles at night, solar-powered cars could leapfrog all the new-energy technologies being developed, from plug-in hybrids to hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, in one fell swoop.But the current forecast is only partly sunny because there’s still some work left to reach that level of efficiency.“This is not a technology we are going to see widely used in the next decades,” said Takeshi Miyao, an auto analyst at consultancy Carnorama. “It’s going to take a long time.”Not for lack of trying.",TM,en,The Economic Times India

2019-06-13 00:32:13-05:00,Dream or nightmare: Why India should postpone its electric vehicle plans for ten years,"By Ajay SrivastavaMost discussions on electric vehicles (EVs) focus on benefits and sidestep serious questions. For example, do we know if a faster adoption of EVs would be in India’s interest? Is the currently used EV technology robust enough? Will EVs make us dependent on China?Answers are straightforward. We just need to look at the most critical part of an EV – the battery. What the internal combustion engine is to a petrol car, the battery is to EV. Currently, all EVs use lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). It is the limitations of LIBs that will prevent widespread adoption of EVs. LIBs are expensive and do not support longdistance travel. Worse, raw materials needed to make LIBs are in short supply. Let us understand the seriousness of the issue.The battery used in a typical EV is a massive 500 kg pack consisting of hundreds of large lithium-ion cells that use metals like lithium, cobalt, nickel and manganese. Each metal serves a useful purpose. For example, lithium generates a flow of electrons and helps charge the battery.",TM,en,The Economic Times India

But over the past year, the cyberweapon has boomeranged back and is now showing up in the NSA’s own backyard.It is not just in Baltimore. Security experts say EternalBlue attacks have reached a high, and cybercriminals are zeroing in on vulnerable American towns and cities, from Pennsylvania to Texas, paralyzing local governments and driving up costs.The NSA connection to the attacks on U.S. cities has not been previously reported, in part because the agency has refused to discuss or even acknowledge the loss of its cyberweapon, dumped online in April 2017 by a still-unidentified group calling itself the Shadow Brokers.",TM,en,The Economic Times India

2019-02-27 22:40:00-05:00,"Ford ""Quietly"" Laying Off Thousands From Its China Joint Venture","At a time when global auto sales are grinding to what feels like inevitable prolonged recession, the world is taking many of its industry cues from China. Which is why it is notable that Ford's China JV would be laying off ""thousands"" of workers according to the NYT. Thousands of the JV's 20,000 total workers are expected to be laid off as a result of weak auto sales in the world's second largest economy - a sign of continuing weakness for autos (and the overall economy) heading into the second quarter of 2019. Layoffs recently ""quietly begun"", according to additional reporting from Reuters. Neither Ford nor its China JV, formed in partnership with Changan Automobile Group, had a comment on the reported layoffs Wednesday morning. Car sales in China continued their relentless descent in January, falling 17.7%, as we recently expected would happen when discussing Europe's tumbling January auto sales. This follows the country's first full year slump (2018) in more than two decades and it puts further pressure on the state of the global automotive market.",TM,en,Zero Hedge

Meanwhile, the United States has shored up its presence in Syria ahead of the planned draw down, transferring about 150 trucks and armoured vehicles and mobile generators to northeast Syria from neighboring Iraq , Turkey’s Anadolu Agency has reported, citing local sources.",TM,en,Zero Hedge

The professor, Charles Taylor , criticized Gillette’s new “The Best Men Can Be” ad campaign, in an op-ed for Forbes . A spin-off of the company’s old “The Best a Man Can Get” campaign, ""The Best Men Can Be"" was launched with a now-viral commercial that highlights behaviors in boys and men such as bullying, sexual harassment, and sexism. In the ad, Gillette calls out “toxic masculinity"" and attributes this concept to men as a whole with a YouTube description reading ""bullying. Harassment. Is this the best a man can get?"" “The use of the term 'toxic masculinity' in the ad was a flat-out mistake,” Taylor noted in his op-ed. “While only mentioned quickly and briefly, the use of this term, which many men associate with a one-sided critique and stereotype of an entire gender [sic].” Taylor went on to add that corporations should never alienate a substantial portion of their consumer base, which Gillette’s campaign “unnecessarily” did.",TM,en,Zero Hedge
