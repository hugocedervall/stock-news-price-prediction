2020-01-24 06:46:34-05:00,Broadridge adviser study finds ETFs set to dominate,"24th Jan 2020 - 11:46am Broadridge adviser study finds ETFs set to dominate Submitted By Beverly Chandler | 24/01/2020 - 11:46am The latest ETF study into the behaviour of financial advisers around ETF investing from Broadridge Financial Solutions, finds that younger financial advisers tend to prefer to use low-cost ETFs over managed mutual fund. The study is largely focused on the US market, but the firm believes the themes are ‘universally interesting’. The study found that the use of ETFs is not evenly distributed across financial advisers with notable differences in adoption by channel. Europe is the region of most interest for foreign market ETFs for US advisers and currently, ETFs make up 27 per cent of actively managed mutual funds in adviser asset allocation and are set to surpass actively managed mutual funds (29 per cent) in the next few years. Broadridge found that over 35 per cent of advisers use ETFs as a core part of the portfolio, while more than a third of advisers do not have strong confidence in their knowledge level of ETFs. “As ETFs become the primary choice for advisers, asset managers may be challenged to reconfigure fund line-ups and product development.",BR,en,etfexpress.com

2020-01-20 04:59:57-05:00,Broadridge survey reveals advisers plan to move away from mutual funds to ETFs,"20th Jan 2020 - 9:59am Broadridge survey reveals advisers plan to move away from mutual funds to ETFs Submitted By Mark Kitchen | 20/01/2020 - 9:59am A new survey of Broadridge of over 500 financial advisers has revealed that ETF demand is predicted to continue increasing in 2020 and that advisers overwhelmingly plan to shift away from actively managed mutual funds. Eighty-three per cent of advisers surveyed increased their asset allocations to ETFs over the past two years, and 73 per cent say they anticipate that their allocation to ETFs will continue to increase in 2020. Among advisers planning to allocate more assets to ETFs, 55 per cent plan to primarily shift assets away from actively managed equity mutual funds. Fifteen per cent plan to primarily shift assets away from individual stocks, followed by passive equity index mutual funds (14 per cent), cash and equivalents (9 per cent) and bonds or fixed income mutual funds (5 per cent). The likelihood of an adviser shifting from actively managed funds to ETFs increases among younger financial advisers, with 64 per cent of advisers under the age of 40 planning to make this shift. “As asset managers continue to engage with the next generation of financial advisers, it is critical for them to consider the wind change occurring in product flows,” says Matthew Schiffman, Principal at Broadridge Financial Solutions. “Advisers planning to allocate more assets to ETFs next year are most likely to pull away assets from actively managed funds, and it’s a shift that’s likely to become more pronounced over time as lower fee ETFs continue to draw investors away from higher cost investments.” Thirty-six percent of advisers use ETFs primarily for core positions, although usage varies by AUM and channel.",BR,en,Wealth Adviser
