Then the coronavirus brought Sin City to a halt, right as the PE giant was trying to unload one of its multi-billion-dollar jewels.","Blackstone has bet big on Las Vegas, snapping up four casinos in the last five years. Now, all of the casinos are temporarily closed – but the private-equity giant should still make money from rent on three of the properties. Its most recent deal left four banks on the hook for $1.9 billion of debt that they're struggling to syndicate. Click here for more BI Prime stories .

But despite the dark backdrop, the private-equity giant has an income stream even as the casinos are closed: hundreds of millions in guaranteed annual rent from MGM Resorts for three of the four casinos Blackstone owns in Vegas, including from a two-casino partnership with MGM's real-estate business.","MGM,MGP",en,Business Insider
