2020-11-13 17:59:43-05:00,"Time To Go All-In The ""Big Short 3.0""? 80% Of New York Hotels On Verge Of Default","Time To Go All-In The ""Big Short 3.0""? 80% Of New York Hotels On Verge Of Default Tyler Durden Fri, 11/13/2020 - 17:59 Now that hedge funds have finally started piling into the "" Big Short 3.0"" trade, which as we first explained back in June is basically shifting the CMBS short from malls to hotels, every incremental development in the sector is closely scrutinized. And judging by the lack of appreciation in the fulcrum BBB- tranche of the CMBX Series 9 index which has the highest exposure to hotels - despite a very modest rebound earlier this week on vaccine hopes - developments continue to be adverse with little sign of recovery on the horizon. A recent tailwind blast for the CMBX 9 shorts came from a September report from NorthStar according to which, without aid 74% percent of US hotels said they expect to lay off more employees, with a whopping two thirds of properties warning they won't be able to last another six months at the current projected revenue and occupancy levels. Needless to say, should two-thirds of the US hotel industry fold, shorting the CMBX S9 BBB- could well be the most profitable (institutionally sized) short in recent history when the Fed has effectively made shorting impossible.",SHO,en,Zero Hedge

A filing with the New York State Department of Labor on Aug. 31 said the iconic 478-room hotel situated on 234 West 42nd Street would 'permanently close' on Oct. 1. WSJ reached out to Sunstone Hotel Investors Inc., the real estate investment trust which manages the hotel for more color on the upcoming closing. A Sunstone spokesperson responded in an emailed statement by indicating the filing to New York state officials ""was not intended to imply that there is a permanent closure."" The spokesperson said the filing was intended to inform state officials that layoffs would be seen in the coming months as a result of the closing, adding that a ""definitive reopening date has not been determined or established and will be impacted by negotiations with our lender, as well as market conditions."" Last month, Sunstone revealed in an SEC filing that it had missed several months of mortgage payments on the property.",SHO,en,Zero Hedge

With no rebound in sight, the second great depression for commercial real estate is ahead and could lead to a massive default wave of shopping malls and luxury hotels. Judging by the ongoing collapse in commercial real estate, as we recently noted , CMBX 6, which track 25 commercial-mortgage-backed securities with high exposure to 2012 shopping mall loans, has tumbled during lockdowns, resulting in a handsome payout for the likes of Carl Icahn, McNamara and others who were short the tranche. Last week we said, ""keep a close eye on CMBX 9"" with its ""outlier exposure to hotels which have quickly emerged as the most impacted sector from the pandemic, this may well be the next big short."" The various CMBX series are shown in the chart below, with CMBX 9 most notable for its 17% exposure to hotels.",SHO,en,Zero Hedge
