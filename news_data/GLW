With the help of her husband Randy Cooper and members of Prescott Fire and Rescue, Holly Cooper was able to deliver 61 Thanksgiving meals to people in need or could not spend the holiday with family. Five years ago, Holly Cooper of Prescott purchased the former Prescott Community School, which she turned into an event space named The Eagles Nest LLC. She later took a position with Creston Community High School, but decided not to return this year and to instead pursue her dream of opening her own kitchen in Prescott in what was once the school’s home economics room. She said it was her dream come true. In her kitchen, Cooper sought to do something simple – cook and visit with those in her community. “It has taken off as I have never, ever imagined,” said Cooper. Despite the success of her business venture, the pandemic started to limit the number of people could enter the space and how she could offer her service. “I make it very easy now.",GLW,en,Creston News Advertiser

Corning Guardiant is a copper-based additive for paint that kills 99.9% of bacteria and viruses that land on surfaces. Pending approval from the EPA, Corning and its partner PPG will start selling antiviral paint products that can neutralize SARS-CoV-2. After almost a year of COVID-19, most people know that you can catch the illness from touching surfaces that have been contaminated. The risk is minimal but real, as the novel coronavirus can survive on surfaces anywhere from a few hours to a few days. In certain conditions, the virus can last for almost a month on surfaces like smartphone glass. The simplest way to mitigate that risk is to wash your hands often during the day and use sanitizer whenever soap and water aren’t readily available.

Optical fiber preform as a hi-tech product and a crucial link in the optical fiber industry chain contributes to 70% or so of profit margin. Global 4G and FTTH construction at dusk leads to the shrinking demand for optical fibers and cables, so does for optical fiber preform. But the 5G construction produces a growing demand for not only optical fibers but optical fiber preform. In 2019, the global optical fiber preform capacities were estimated to hit 26,676 tons and output approximately 18,902 tons, with the capacity utilization at 70.9% and showing a severe supply glut arising from the successive production of the construction projects invested by Chinese enterprises over the recent years. It is expected that the world's optical fiber preform capacity will rise to 30,436 t/a in 2020. China has been the largest producer of optical fiber preform in the world alongside production expansion of Chinese competitors, with its capacity registering 16,426 t/a (basically meeting the domestic market demand) with a 61.6% share of the global total in 2019, while China's output of optical fiber preform edge down 1.1% on a like-for-like basis to roughly 8,800 tons largely due to the sluggish demand in optical fibers and cables market amid completion of 4G construction and FTTH as well as the infancy of 5G construction.",GLW,en,Benzinga

Given the ubiquity of Gorilla Glass, we’ll likely be seeing a lot of the new glass in the near future. The new Gorilla Glass, simply called Victus rather than a number like its predecessors, can allegedly drop as far as 2 meters (or about 6.5 feet) without damage. That’s apparently twice as tough as Gorilla Glass 6. It’ll also be much more resistance to scratches and impact damage, as well as maintaining integrity even after being damaged.

2020-06-09 17:36:00-05:00,Galaxy Fold 2 won’t have the one new feature you really wanted,"With the Galaxy Fold 2’s release date coming up, more reports have emerged detailing some of the new foldable’s specs. A report from Korea says the Fold 2 will feature the same UTG display technology as the Galaxy Z Flip, suggesting the handset will be more durable than its predecessor. A separate report supported the claims, adding that the UTG screen isn’t thick enough to support a stylus. Samsung has therefore dropped the Fold 2’s rumored S Pen support. Samsung is planning to unveil a couple of new flagships in early August. The Galaxy Note 20 and the Galaxy Fold 2 will be the stars of the upcoming online-only Unpacked press conference, just as expected. The new Note will build upon the design of the Galaxy S20, but will include a built-in stylus. The Galaxy Fold 2 is the more exciting of the two, though, at least on paper. Samsung’s second-gen Fold is supposed to offer a no-notch design, high-end specs, and a more affordable price tag than its predecessor. The handset was also said to ship with an S Pen of its own, which was one of the most interesting Fold 2 rumors we've heard.",GLW,en,BGR

2020-05-07 12:58:00-05:00,The investment Magic Leap is seeking from a major health company could help it pivot towards healthcare AR applications,"Alternative reality (AR) company Magic Leap reportedly signed a terms sheet with a major health company, according to Business Insider. The Information first reported the potential deal, which could entail a $100 million equity investment. There is still significant uncertainty surrounding the terms of deal, however, as Magic Leap's CEO purportedly told employees there's still a chance it could fall through, and some employees are said to believe it could result in a full acquisition rather than equity stake. In late April, Magic Leap — which had previously raised over $2.6 billion from the likes of AT&T and Google on the promise of its AR technology — cut half of its workforce and decided to focus solely on enterprise applications going forward. Beyond giving Magic Leap a lifeline, the investment from a health company will likely facilitate an opportunity for Magic Leap to focus more exclusively on healthcare AR applications. Magic Leap already had to narrow the scope of its target market to sustain operations during the current funding crunch , and the investment from a healthcare company could take that a step further — the unnamed health company reportedly plans to use Magic Leap's AR headsets for surgical procedures and healthcare professional training.",GLW,en,Business Insider
