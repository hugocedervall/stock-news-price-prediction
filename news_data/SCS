Yet toxic substances circulate in waterways and bloodstreams, leached out from all the consumables of everyday life. Shortsightedness and paltry data in the cycles of product design and engineering are partly to blame for this collateral damage of modern chemistry. Most product designers are unlettered in chemistry, and the practice of green chemistry remains in its early years. Even a basic count of all the industrial chemicals in use is scarce — somewhere over 80,000 , according to the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act Inventory, although the EPA total for recent output is less than 9,000 . It's simply asking too much of most people formulating a consumer product only to include ingredients that are proven not to harm living systems. But what if design teams seeking safer ingredients didn't have to know much about the molecules that comprise the stuff they're making?",SCS,en,GreenBiz

The US manufacturer - which last year recorded revenues of $3.7bn - said it had already achieved 'carbon neutrality' across its own operations thanks to a combination of CO2 reduction efforts and investing in carbon offsets, but that it now planned to go further by removing more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits by 2030. It has also announced a new set of decarbonisation goals, for which it has secured validation from the Science-Based Targets initiative which approves targets that in line with a 1.5C global warming trajectory. The firm is aiming to cut absolute emissions from its own operations in half by 2030 against a 2010 baseline, in addition to scaling back on business travel and waste generation.",SCS,en,BusinessGreen
