2020-09-01 06:56:45-05:00,"Capital Markets Weekly: Germany’s Green Bond debut imminent, boosting expanding ESG sector","ESG In an investor call on 27 August, the German Finance ministry announced that it plans to issue up to EUR6 billion from the pending sale of Germany's debut Green bond, which will have a 10-year maturity. It plans to sell up to EUR12 billion of Green debt in 2020 to fund a pool of EUR12.7 billion of identified projects. In an earlier statement Joerg Kukies, Deputy Finance Minister, stated that a second offering would follow in the fourth quarter, with Germany looking ""to become the euro-area's benchmark issuer across various maturities, to build a green yield curve for green bonds"". Media reports suggest that two, five and 30-year Green sales will thus follow in due course. Kukies also suggested that the planned 10-year sale would be priced in line with outstanding conventional bonds, without specifying which issue would be ""twinned"" with a green equivalent. Coca Cola Femsa enjoyed clear success with its debut Green Bond on 26 August. It gained orders of USD5.2 billion for a proposed USD500 million sale, increasing the issue to USD705 million in response to the strong demand.",TME,en,IHS Markit
