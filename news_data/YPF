2020-10-20 17:45:00-05:00,Playing Chicken In The High Yield Market,"Playing Chicken In The High Yield Market Tyler Durden Tue, 10/20/2020 - 18:45 By Nick Dunbar of Risky Finance When Covid-19 sent corporate bonds into a tailspin in March , it set in motion a game of chicken at overleveraged companies. Like James Dean and his rivals in the movie Rebel Without A Cause , the companies and their bondholders were like drivers racing towards a cliff. Should investors accept a painful write down on their bonds in order to keep companies alive and avoid even worse pain later on? Or should they call the company’s bluff and insist on full repayment of their debt? The Risky Finance corporate bond tool provides a ringside seat on some of these scenarios. Take the sector whose spreads declined the most on average since March – Oil & Gas. Investors in high yield bonds who bought that month have seen returns of 300% or more, while investment grade bonds have provided a 30% return since then.

2020-05-12 00:44:46-05:00,Argentina: Unconventional Activity Update,"The year 2020 has been filled with surprises as the COVID-19 pandemic spreads worldwide, leaving many homebound, resulting in a negative impact for many industries and ultimately leading to a decline in oil and gas demand across the globe. The pandemic paired with a supply surplus has dramatically lowered the oil price and left the energy industry in a difficult position. Argentina's hydrocarbon sector is no exception. Although Argentina has been producing from conventional formations since 1920's, conventional production has been steadily declining since 2007. Once operators started exploring different drilling techniques and successfully drilled the first unconventional well in 2010, new possibilities opened up for the future of Argentina's energy industry both in the tight gas and shale regions. Over the years, both international and local operators have applied different frac parameters in the Vaca Muerta play as they work to understand its geologic and reservoir properties. Local operators have followed the example of national oil company, YPF, while major companies such as ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, and Chevron, have even taken their unconventional development experience used in their North America assets and have applied it to Argentina to expand and improve their portfolios.",YPF,en,IHS Markit
