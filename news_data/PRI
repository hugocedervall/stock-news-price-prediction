2020-08-26 20:01:46-05:00,Pick up Some Values in Small-Cap Stocks,"Whatever happened to small-cap stocks? The argument for smaller companies used to be simple: Their shares are riskier, on average, than shares of larger companies, but they return more to investors. So, more risk, more reward. That’s a rock-solid principle of investing (and of life, for that matter). Though small-cap stocks may be too volatile for some investors, a small injection of small caps can give a portfolio a nice boost. SEE MORE 12 Splendid Small-Cap Growth Stocks to Buy One advantage of a stock with a small market capitalization (defined as price times shares outstanding) is that, being small, it may elude the attention of analysts and most investors. Such a stock can be an overlooked bargain. Another plus is that, with a small cap, you have a chance to make gigantic returns on your original investment. If you had bought Netflix (symbol, NFLX ) in 2008, when it was a small-cap stock trading at about $4 a share, and you had held it until today, you would have increased your initial investment by a factor of more than 100.","PRO,PRI",en,Kiplinger Washington Editors
