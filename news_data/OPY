2020-11-12 04:00:04-05:00,Fireball: Visitors from Darker Worlds review – Werner Herzog dodges meteorites | Peter Bradshaw's film of the week,"In his latest science documentary, the film-maker considers the cataclysmic threat from space that’s as real now as it was when the dinosaurs died out In 2007, Werner Herzog made a movie about Antarctica called Encounters at the End of the World where he met the Cambridge University geographer and seismologist Clive Oppenheimer. The resulting partnership has opened up whole new adventures for Herzog in pop anthropology and the history of ideas. Together, Herzog and Oppenheimer made Into the Inferno in 2016, with Oppenheimer largely in front of the camera and Herzog behind, naturally supplying the unmistakable rasping voiceover with its occasional flourishes of nihilist black comedy. Into the Inferno was all about how volcanos create strange belief systems and supplicant ideologies in the humans around them. Now Herzog and Oppenheimer are back (and Oppenheimer gets a co-directing credit) with another nimbly curious and fascinating film, on a similar topic: meteorites. And incidentally: this is a rare example of modern documentary film-making that uses voiceover – that inimitable Herzog growl.",OPY,en,The Guardian
2020-11-10 12:42:56-05:00,Oppenheimer Sees These 3 Stocks Skyrocketing Over 100%,"The U.S. presidential election has come to a close, and Wall Street isn’t opposed to the administration change. Last week saw the S&P 500 notch its second-best performance during an election week on record, even as Trump’s chances of getting re-elected became slimer and slimer.Weighing in for Oppenheimer, Chief Investment Strategist John Stoltzfus noted, “What appears clear so far is that the equity markets are not averse to a change of administration stateside at least so long as the Republicans maintain control over the Senate. Checks and balances ‘on the Hill’ have been known to be important to investors over the course of history. The present in our view is no exception.”There is, however, some uncertainty surrounding the Senate, with the two runoff elections for seats in Georgia scheduled for January 5, only 15 days before Inauguration Day. That said, Stoltzfus points out that continued better-than-expected Q3 results from S&P 500-listed companies, economic data tied to job gains and a sharp decline in the unemployment rate have also been helping to prop stocks up.Taking Stoltzfus’ outlook into consideration, we wanted to take a closer look at three stocks earning a round of applause from Oppenheimer, with the firm’s analysts forecasting over 100% upside potential for each.",OPY,en,Yahoo Finance

But that extra friction makes your brain work harder at engaging with the information. And that engagement yields better learning. Click here for more BI Prime content . Typing is fast. Handwriting is slow. Weirdly, that's precisely why handwriting is better suited to learning. Take it from research psychologists Pam A. Mueller of Princeton University and Daniel M. Oppenheimer of the University of California, Los Angeles, who did a fascinating study investigating just how terrible laptops are for note-taking in classrooms. Earlier studies have argued that laptops make for poor note-taking because of the litany of distractions available on the internet, but their experiments yielded a counterintuitive conclusion: Handwriting is better because it slows the learner down. By slowing down the process of taking notes, you accelerate learning. It works like this.

2019-05-24 09:01:09-05:00,Zoom Video started with a 'perform' rating at Oppenheimer,"Oppenheimer analyst Ittai Kidron initiated coverage of Zoom Video Communications Inc.'s stock with a perform rating late Thursday, arguing that the company has a large and expanding total addressable market but that its shares look fairly valued following a big run-up since the company's April initial public offering. The stock is currently trading at $78.50, more than double its IPO price of $36. ""Zoom's freemium tier (self-serve, unlimited use) has driven viral user expansion, while giving the company a springboard to quickly convert users to paying customers with multiple expansion levers (new users, new use cases, higher tiers, new products, international expansion),"" Kidron wrote. ""The net result is fast-paced growth (~48% CAGR) and strong net dollar expansion (high 130% range)."" Kidron said that the company looks poised to sustain its ""strong execution"" but he awaits a more attractive entry point before recommending the shares. They're up 25% over the past month, as the S&P 500 has fallen 3.2%.",OPY,en,MarketWatch
