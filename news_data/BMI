2019-11-27 15:49:59-05:00,"How much weight you should gain during pregnancy, according to doctors","How much weight you gain while pregnant depends on your size and shape before you were pregnant. Typical weight gain is 25 to 35 pounds, but it's healthy for women who are underweight to gain 25 to 40 pounds and women who are overweight to gain 15 to 25 pounds. In general, a woman should gain 2 to 4 pounds in the first trimester and then 1 pound per week thereafter. During the first trimester, the baby is only about 5 centimeters long, so most of the weight you gain comes from increased fat stores, the uterus, and placenta, which are all preparing for when the baby starts to grow larger. By the third trimester, the baby will be gaining about half a pound a week. This is when it's especially important to get enough calories and nutrients in your diet.
