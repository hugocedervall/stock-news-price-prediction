Wally and his owner, Nathan Drewel, captivated much of the Illinois Valley on Wednesday afternoon, as all were happy to see that no one was injured during the wild ride. Wally’s afternoon sparked many questions from the community, from the legality of owning exotic animals in Illinois to what even is a wallaroo. While the latter can be answered with a quick google search — a species of macropods between the size of a kangaroo and a wallaby — the legal question has proven to be more complex. In Peru Police Chief Doug Bernabei’s initial statement given hours after Wally’s arrival at Bridgeview Veterinary Hospital in Peru, he stated he believed the animal was lawfully owned and possessed by state permit. Thursday morning, Bernabei stated the PD is still going through an investigation, but they now believe Wally was owned without a proper permit, and the city and an agricultural agency will work with his owner to find a new and suitable home.",PDS,en,Sauk Valley Media

To get this story plus others to your inbox each day, hours before they're published on Business Insider, click here. Medical device giant Abbott received expanded FDA clearance for its Infinity Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) system permitting it to target an additional area of the brain associated with Parkinson's Disease (PD), according to MobiHealth News. The Infinity DBS system connects to an iPad mini via Bluetooth, through which providers can program patients' therapy and monitor clinical outcomes via Abbott's software platform. Meanwhile, patients can manage their symptoms through an iPod touch-powered controller for the device. For context, DBS is a neurosurgical procedure in which a device known as a neurostimulator is placed in a patient's brain and sends electrical impulses to specific brain targets to help treat movement disorders like PD. The FDA's expanded clearance of Abbott's DBS system could help Abbott broaden its portfolio of devices targeting neurological conditions.","PDS,PD",en,Business Insider

That defeat here was even a prospect, though, shows just how much Italy’s political geography has changed. Historically Emilia-Romagna, in the north of the country, is a bedrock of communism and has had an unbroken string of leftist governments since the second world war. But the left has been losing ground since the financial crisis of 2008 – as in so much of the continent – with austerity-stricken rural communities and provincial towns in particular drifting rightwards.

2019-11-01 03:11:30-05:00,Italy's regional elections,"Exit polls of the regional election in Umbria, held on 27 October, point to a decisive victory for the right-wing candidate Donatella Tesei, who is backed by the anti-immigrant League party (Lega), the far-right Brothers of Italy (Fratelli d'Italia), and the center-right Forza Italia. With nearly 60% of the votes, Tesei decisively defeated her center-left rival Vincenzo Bianconi, leader of a civic alliance backed by the Democratic Party (Partito Democratico: PD) and the Five Star Movement (Movimento Cinque Stelle: M5S). Tesei's victory marks the first time in the postwar period that a candidate from the right has won power in Umbria, a traditional stronghold of Italy's left.
