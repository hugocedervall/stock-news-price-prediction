2020-11-17 12:05:00-05:00,How to Build a Green Hydrogen Economy for the U.S. West,"Out in Utah, a coal-fired power plant supplying electricity to Los Angeles is being outfitted with natural gas-fired turbines that will eventually be able to run on hydrogen, created via electrolysis with wind and solar power, and stored in massive underground caverns for use when that clean energy isn’t available for the grid. This billion dollar-plus project could eventually expand to more renewable-powered electrolyzers, storage and generators to supply dispatchable power for the greater western U.S. grid. It could also grow to include hydrogen pipelines to augment and replace the natural gas used for heating and industry or supply hydrogen fuel cell vehicle fleets across the region. That’s the vision of the Western Green Hydrogen Initiative ( WGHI ), a group representing 11 Western states, two Canadian provinces and key green hydrogen industry players including Mitsubishi and utilities Dominion Energy and Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. WGHI launched Tuesday to align state and federal efforts to create “a regional green hydrogen strategy,” including “a large scale, long-duration, renewable energy storage regional reserve.” At the heart of this effort are two projects in central Utah.",D,en,Green Technology Media

At least, that’s how Duncan McIntyre, CEO of Highland Electric Transportation, sees it. McIntyre, who founded renewable energy procurement and analysis marketplace Alternex in 2011 and sold it to Edison International in 2015, started Highland Electric two years ago to build a “business entirely around the school bus electrification market.” The idea is to replace the up-front and ongoing costs of EV buses and charging infrastructure with a fixed annual fee, equal to or less than a school district’s current budget for owning, fueling and maintaining their existing diesel-fueled fleets. Highland finances the arrangement and recoups the investment by finding ways to earn money from the new fleet’s battery capacity when they’re not on the road. A major part of that equation relies on tapping their energy storage capacity for soaking up low-cost overnight or midday power — and more importantly, discharging it during grid-stressed evening peaks.",D,en,Green Technology Media

Like other net-zero carbon goals , Ameren’s will rely on “further advancements in innovative, carbon-free technologies and constructive federal and state energy and economic policies” to reach its final goal, CEO Warner Baxter said in a Monday statement. Ameren joins a growing list of U.S. utilities committing to net-zero carbon by midcentury in states that haven’t yet set that goal as a mandate, although several are on the cusp of doing so.

2020-09-16 07:00:00-05:00,The 5 Biggest US Utilities Committing to Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050,"Over the past three years, some of the country’s biggest utilities have been committing to a goal that few may have predicted they’d undertake on their own: weaning themselves off carbon-emitting generation by 2050. Driving this sea change in long-term planning is a combination of public pressure and energy economics. The falling costs of wind and solar power are pushing utilities to find ways to incorporate them into their long-range plans, even as they struggle to define what resources can be relied on to provide the dispatchable power they need. At the same time, the increasingly dire effects of global warming are bringing more Americans in line with much of the rest of the world in making carbon-emissions reduction a top policy priority. Utilities in many states now face mandates to move to 100 percent renewable energy or cut carbon to zero by 2050. Others are likely to face similar mandates in short order. If Joe Biden wins the presidential election in November and Congress enacts his $2 trillion clean energy and infrastructure ambition, utilities will need to reconfigure their plans to meet Biden's nationwide goal of zero-carbon electricity by 2035.",D,en,Green Technology Media

Often espoused by leftist professors, lawmakers, and think tanks, the increasing disparity in wealth among Americans has been a growing concern. Many have questioned for years whether the Federal Reserve and their fiat currency monetary system is a fundamental fraud in our economy today. Is the Federal Reserve causing wealth inequality, thereby sowing the seeds of Marxism? Wealth inequality is an issue that both political sides should be willing to tackle because it can cause terrible consequences for a cohesive society. One can easily go off on the issues of personal responsibility and envy politics, but the reality is society must deal with the issue regardless of the morality of the issues – see “ Trapped on a Deserted Island with 200 Hungry Savages .” While the Left is correct in their concerns, they are ignoring a major cause of the rampant, growing inequality in America – currency debasement and instead blame capitalism.",D,en,Zero Hedge

While the terms of the RFP allow for bids for different technologies, the solicitation is meant to support the long-range plans laid out in PacifiCorp’s integrated resource plan filed last year. That plan broke new ground for the 1.9 million-customer utility by setting its first long-range goals for replacing the coal-fired power it largely relies on today with a mix of solar and wind farms backed by energy storage.",D,en,Green Technology (Feed)

The national government under its dictator Robert Mugabe had spent years confiscating private property– real estate, businesses, factories, bank deposits, etc. And unsurprisingly, this had a disastrous effect on the economy. Productive citizens and talented entrepreneurs left Zimbabwe in droves– after all, who would want to keep operating under such awful conditions? So within a few years, everything from food production to mining output to manufacturing had plummeted. The banking sector collapsed. Unemployment soared. Tax revenue dried up. So Mugabe did what most politicians would do in that position: he started printing money. This is an old trick that governments have relied on for thousands of years.

Announced yesterday, the deal will see the Norwegian state-owned energy firm purchase all of the power generated by the hybrid solar-battery project, which is owned and operated by the council via Warrington Renewables Ltd. Statkraft described the utility-scale solar park - which was completed late last year - as one of the UK's most technically-advanced solar projects, as it utilises technology enabling both sides of the solar panel to produce energy in order to maximise output. Nick Heyward, head of UK energy storage and markets at Statkraft UK, said the power purchase agreement (PPA) would help the council maximise the overall value of the subsidy-free solar project's generation. ""We had to develop a bespoke hybrid PPA solution to manage the various aspects of the site, reflecting the overall innovation that has gone into the site itself,"" he explained. ""By optimising the energy storage alongside the renewable energy for Warrington council we hope to set a blueprint to follow, for other local authorities and partners that are committed about delivering net zero as well as benefiting their communities through revenues from renewable energy."" Statkraft intends to manage the power it purchases from the York solar project through its virtual 'Unity' power platform, which aggregates 2.6GW of installed capacity from its network of wind and solar facilities, as well as from its flexible gas assets and battery arrays.",D,en,BusinessGreen

2020-05-19 07:09:00-05:00,5 Wind Energy Giants Embracing Solar Power,"Onshore wind is now the leading renewable energy technology in the U.S., and it's still knocking competitors out of the way. Last year wind overtook hydropower in total generation, and 2020 is on track to be a record year for new wind farm construction. But all other energy sources are losing ground to solar these days, wind included. Solar accounted for 40 percent of new U.S. generation capacity in 2019, its largest share in history. After 2020 its lead over wind will widen rapidly, according to Wood Mackenzie's forecast. Large-scale solar is already cost competitive with wind in many states, and analysts believe solar has an easier path toward further cost reductions . In Texas, home to nearly a third of the country’s 100 gigawatts of wind capacity, there’s now more solar than wind in the interconnection queue. Falling costs, steady efficiency gains and federal incentives have thrust solar to the center of the strategic plans of many American energy companies.

The new plan, by contrast, sets out a goal of nearly 16 gigawatts of solar, more than 5 gigawatts of offshore wind, and 2.7 gigawatts of energy storage over the next 15 years. That’s nearly quadruple the targets laid out in Dominion’s 2019 IRP, and a major shift from a 2018 IRP that was rejected by Virginia’s regulator, the State Corporation Commission (SCC). Dominion’s new IRP is driven by Virginia's Clean Economy Act passed earlier this year, which calls for 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2045 and sets targets for energy efficiency, energy storage, and in-state solar and wind power.",D,en,Green Technology

Both votes were carried by Democrats who won majorities in both houses from Republicans in last year’s election, although one House Democrat voted against it and one Republican Senator voted for it. The primary feature of the law, SB 851, is its call for Dominion Virginia, the state’s dominant utility, and the smaller Appalachian Power Co., to supply 30 percent of their power from renewables by 2030, and to close all carbon-emitting power plants by 2045 for Dominion and by 2050 for Appalachian.",D,en,Green Technology

2020-01-24 10:10:49-05:00,2019 Was the Year When Everything Changed for Utilities Planning Energy Storage,"For almost every year in the historical record, utilities paid no attention to battery storage. Because of this, the past offers little insight into how quickly utilities will adopt the technology, which helps integrate renewables onto the grid, deliver peak capacity without carbon emissions, instantly adjust the frequency of the system and more. As costs have fallen and early adopters liked what they saw from initial trials, though, the cycle from pilot to evaluation to widespread adoption is speeding up. The storage industry, and advocates of low carbon electricity, have a lot riding on that process. A new analysis sheds some light on how that adoption cycle works. Wood Mackenzie storage researcher Gregson Curtin tallied up utility integrated resource plans from the last three years — those are the documents where companies tell the world what power plants they expect to build in the coming years.
