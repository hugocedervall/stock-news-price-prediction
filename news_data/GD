Als Verteidigungsministerin und Milizbeauftragter am Donnerstag das neue Milizpaket präsentierten, fiel eine Waffe besonders auf: Das Scharfschützengewehr Steyr 08 A2, das jener Soldat trug, den Kreislaufbeschwerden in die Knie zwangen. Mehr als neun Kilogramm wiegt diese Waffe, die über eine Einsatzschussweite von 1.200 Metern verfügt. Die Waffe wurde laut Steyr Arms speziell für den militärischen Gebrauch entwickelt, vor allem die Möglichkeit eines raschen Laufwechsels sei gegeben. Bereits im Vorjahr hatte Steyr Arms 220 dieser Scharfschützengewehre an das Bundesheer für die präsenten Verbände geliefert, wie viele Stück die Miliz bekommen soll, ist noch unklar. Das Steyr 08 A2 soll – wie auch die neuen Fahrzeuge – nicht nur der Miliz zugutekommen, sondern auch von präsenten Kräften verwendet werden.

The Bombardier Global 7500 and Gulfstream G700 are the latest aircraft to be introduced by the leading manufacturers, offering the greatest ranges and capacity of any wide-cabin private jet. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . The novel coronavirus has undoubtedly soured the traveling public on commercial air travel as concerns of proximity spread while onboard aircraft have, in part, caused the mass cancellations of bookings and grounded thousands of airliners.

Aunque el contrato no contemplaba la construcción de las nuevas fragatas fuera de Estados Unidos, en caso de obtenerse sí hubiera prestigiado la marca Navantia en el mundo además de haberse embolsado la cantidad de unos 795 millones de dólares en concepto de diseño. La opción española iba de la mano del astillero estadounidense General Dynamics Bath Iron Works para llevar a cabo su construcción final en Maine. Se trata de uno de los principales constructores de buques de EE.UU. y en todo momento ha llevado el liderazgo de las negociaciones.

Whereas almost all of the contents of that article merely repeat what has already been reported, this article in the Times states repeatedly that boosting corporations such as Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Boeing, and Northrop-Grumman, has been a major — if not the very top — motivation driving US international relations, and that at least regarding Ukraine, Trump has not been supporting, but has instead been trying to block, those weapons-sales — and creating massive enemies in the US Government as a direct consequence.",GD,en,Zero Hedge

Bush was able to announce that there was a “new sheriff in town” pledged to wipe terrorism from the face of the earth. “You’re either with us or against us,” he growled and he backed up his warning of lethal retribution with an enemies list that he called the “axis of evil.” The axis of evil identified in those days in the 2002 State of the Union Address consisted of Iraq, Iran and North Korea. Iraq, which had not yet been invaded and conquered by the American war machine, was number one on the list, with Saddam allegedly brandishing weapons of mass destruction deliverable by the feared transatlantic gliders that could easily strike the United States. Bush explained that ""Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror. The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear weapons for over a decade.",GD,en,Zero Hedge
