Each of these statistics points to different solutions for reducing buildings’ carbon footprint. Shifting heating from fossil fuels to electricity can cut direct emissions. More efficient building design, materials, and appliances can cut electricity consumption. And managing electricity use to match grid needs can help utilities control the costliest part of decarbonizing their systems — reducing reliance on dispatchable fossil-fueled power. The Department of Energy’s $65 million funding for “connected communities” projects announced last week is focused on all three parts of this equation.

The deal hands an exit to AMS investors, including former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who bought into the startup's early vision of turning commercial buildings into flexible grid assets. After winning pivotal utility contracts in California, AMS ran up against the capital constraints of managing a multi-year infrastructure buildout as a venture-backed company. In 2017, it pivoted to software to dispatch grid assets more profitably in competitive markets. That's the expertise Fluence bought. The joint venture between AES and Siemens already provides software to its battery customers to govern system safety and performance, and to dispatch according to market rules and interconnection constraints. But the AI-backed real-time trading algorithm AMS built will help Fluence customers make more money on their projects, said Fluence CTO Brett Galura. ""Energy storage is really the first truly dispatchable digital asset on the electric grid,"" Galura said in an interview Wednesday.

More than half of the 48 new reactors that the World Nuclear Association (WNA) lists as being built worldwide are in just four countries: China, India, the United Arab Emirates and Russia. China alone accounts for a quarter of the total. Meanwhile in the U.S., the world’s top generator of nuclear power, only two new reactors are currently under construction — and Southern Company’s Plant Vogtle expansion is massively overdue and over budget.

Much of the new renewable capacity being built around the world is being offset by new coal and gas capacity, leaving the global generation mix more or less how it was in 2000. Even those utilities and independent power producers (IPPs) prioritizing renewables are adding further natural gas and coal capacity, in most cases. Many companies face the prospect of gas generation assets being stranded unless carbon capture and storage technology becomes widespread soon, according to research by Oxford University’s Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment and published in Nature Energy on Monday. The research used machine learning to look for trends in the portfolios of companies between 2000-2018. It identified four clusters that the companies, large and small, fell into.

Last year the U.S. consumed 11.3 quadrillion British thermal units of coal, the lowest level since 1964. By comparison, total consumption of renewable energy hit a record-high 11.5 quadrillion Btu, the EIA said Thursday, as the country’s base of wind and solar farms continued to expand. Prior to 2019, the last year that the country got more total energy from renewables than coal was 1885, when wood was the main renewable resource on offer. Earlier this month the EIA put out figures projecting that renewables will topple coal in the U.S. electricity mix throughout 2020, another major milestone. While most renewable energy is used for power in the U.S., significant amounts are consumed other areas, including biofuels for transportation.

Technology-neutral versus product-led The 17 non-customer developers with multiple projects on the books all employ either a technology-neutral or a product-led strategy. They tend to have experience integrating many different distributed energy resources.

2019-05-08 12:57:55-05:00,Utilities sector the only 1 of 11 S&P 500 sectors to lose ground as Treasury yields bounce,"Shares of utility companies were broadly lower Wednesday, with the sector the only one of the S&P 500's 11 sectors to lose ground, weighed down by a big bounce in Treasury yields. The SPDR Utilities Select Sector ETF shed 1.0% in afternoon trade, with 27 of 28 equity components losing ground. The biggest decliner was NRG Energy Inc.'s stock which slumped 5.1%. Among other more active utilities ETF components, shares of AES Corp. lost 2.3%, Excelon Corp. gave up 0.9% and Southern Co. shed 0.6%. The lone gainer was Sempra Energy's stock which tacked on 0.6%. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose 3.6 basis points to 2.484%, after falling 10.4 basis points the previous three sessions, as a bounce in the stock market helped calm risk-off trades. Utilities stocks tend to have relatively high dividend yields, so a rise in yields on low-risk Treasurys make them less attractive. The utilities ETF's dividend yield is 3.15%, compared with the implied yield for the S&P 500 of 1.99%, according to FactSet.",SO,en,MarketWatch
