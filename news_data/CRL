2019-06-22 07:01:20-05:00,Inside Slack's direct listing; State Street goes toe-to-toe with BlackRock,"Dear readers, Slack's non-IPO was no doubt the big story of the week, with its success leading some to predict the market could soon see many more direct listings. Colin Stewart, Morgan Stanley's lead banker on Slack's public debut, told Bloomberg we could see as many as five direct listings in 2020. To put that into context, the only two high profile direct listings in the last two years have been Slack and Spotify. Direct listings differ from typical initial public offerings in that they allow existing shareholders like early employees and investors to sell their shares quickly on the free market. The company itself doesn't raise any money and there's much less interaction with Wall Street banks, known as underwriters in a traditional IPO. Talking to a number of bankers and investors prior to Slack's public debut I was pretty skeptical that it would be a hit. This is mainly because I had always been told that direct listings could only be accomplished with well-known consumer brands (Airbnb, for example, is reportedly weighing one).",CRL,en,Business Insider
2019-06-18 13:57:13-05:00,The CEO of State Street explains why he's going toe-to-toe with Bloomberg and BlackRock by offering asset managers a one-stop technology shop,"State Street's $2.6 billion purchase of Charles River last year thrust it into direct competition with Bloomberg and BlackRock for control of trading desktops across hundreds of asset managers. The man charged with overseeing the strategy is CEO Ronald O'Hanley, a 20-year veteran of the investment management industry who assumed his role January 1. O'Hanley's building a one-stop shop to handle anything an investor might need, from pretrade analytics all the way through to post trade reporting and reconciliation. The stakes are high. State Street's stock price is down 40% since the Charles River deal. Click here for more BI Prime stories . Ronald O'Hanley doesn't immediately come across as a fierce competitor. The State Street CEO speaks in a low voice free of the bravado that other leaders often exhibit. He doesn't stand on ceremony. And he runs State Street, a leader in asset custody, what many consider to be a sleepy corner of banking. But O'Hanley now finds himself competing against some of Wall Street's most formidable foes.",CRL,en,Business Insider
