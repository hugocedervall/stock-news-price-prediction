The SP Group has sought the separation by swapping its more than 18% stake in Tata Sons with shares of listed Tata Group companies like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS).There was also a fresh twist in the fight between the two groups, which began with the removal of Cyrus Mistry from the post of chairman of Tata Sons. The SP Group accused Ratan Tata of breaching his promise to Pallonji Mistry in 1991, immediately after he was appointed chairman of Tata Sons, that he would ""never do anything consciously to hurt you and your family"".The SP Group alleged that in September, the Tatas impeded the banking of its Tata Sons shares.

Further, having that experience tailored to their unique needs is held in even higher esteem. The fund administration space in Ireland has experienced much consolidation in the past few years. Several smaller to medium providers have been sold to either larger banking groups or private equity groups. This has left a dearth of independently owned players in the market. Liam McHugh, managing director of fund administration, CSC, remarks: “Right now, the fund administration space is ever changing due to the significant amount of M&A activity in recent years. This has created a gap in the market for a independently owned company such as CSC. The fact that we have been independently owned for over 120 years will give us a significant advantage as we build our global offering at a time when many of our competitors are considering selling as private equity backers look to realise their investments.” Paul Whelan, managing director of depositary services, CSC, adds: “The consolidation means less opportunity for clients.",TCS,en,InstitutionAlassetManager

2020-10-05 08:08:31-05:00,Why buybacks are better than dividends,"Buybacks can be done roughly about 14 months apart. Given that, a lot of companies will do a buyback in the next 12 months, apart from paying a minuscule amount of dividend as well, says Deepak Shenoy, Founder, Capital Mind. The TCS board is considering a buyback. For shareholders, what is the right way of looking at it because at close to the current price, the company is considering a buyback when the stock price is at an all-time high. Historically buyback is considered to be a vote of confidence but is this more of a compulsion because of Tata Sons?Dividends have been substituted by buybacks in the recent past because till last year, the dividend distribution tax was very high tax ratio compared to payouts if people did it in the format of dividend versus a buyback. This year, while dividend tax has been introduced it is still a little more beneficial for promoters to do a buyback and so the price is irrelevant because whatever amount they would have otherwise be distributed as dividend.",TCS,en,Economic Times India

Clearly the large is getting large. Would you say TCS continues to be in the top spot in the pecking order?Yes definitely and multiple drivers are there for TCS. Both the promoters or one promoter and the other group of Tata Sons would like some liquidity and that is also driving this. Overall, Indian IT costs are down with the travel cost having come down dramatically and there is a return of the digital revenues. So in the nearly $4 trillion dollar global IT pie, digital, automation, work from home, cloud and remote working are getting a lot of scope. The entire software as service, infra as service places are getting bid up and our IT majors are well positioned for that and TCS is at the top of the pack.

2020-09-11 00:53:24-05:00,Why Reliance valuations may not be sustainable,"eliance’s ROE is in single digits and a story is getting built here because valuation is getting ascribed by private investors, says the analyst, asksandipsabharwal.com. The profit of Reliance is not double that of TCS and HDFC Bank put together, but the market cap is. What do you think?It has been driven by people not knowing how to value a particular stock and that is happening in many technology stocks in the US also. People do not know how to figure out the actual valuation of the Jio platform and that is leading to this sort of valuation change. In fact, over the last 10 years, Reliance has not generated free cash flows in even a single year. When you compare it to companies like TCS or HDFC Bank or any other company which has a high ROE, Reliance’s ROE is in single digits. There is a story that is getting built because valuation is getting ascribed by private investors. The future returns depend on execution. They need to execute and they need to generate cash flows because without cash flows, I do not think the valuations will be sustainable.",TCS,en,Economic Times India

Would you tell your clients to get greedy and buy today or is it time to keep the gunpowder dry?What is very clear is that after a very strong up move that we had in the last three months, we have not had any meaningful correction and a large part of this rally was driven by what was happening in the US markets. Plus there is an increased participation from the retail investors in India and also we had some improvement in the data points on a month-on-month basis. Now that we are seeing initial indications of some correction coming into the US markets, it would be fair to expect that we will also go through a bit of a correction which was pretty much warranted.

Now, tech stocks seem to have taken over as the new favourites. The BSE IT index soared 22% in July, the best performing of all sectoral indices. The strong surge has lifted the weightage of the IT sector in the Nifty50 index to its highest level in five years. So should investors also explore a bigger role for this defensive play in a rocky market environment?IT stocks have taken a big leap in the past few weeks, even as the initial wave in pharma lost steam. The beeline for tech stocks is not without reason. A better than expected show by the bigger IT firms in the June quarter points to higher resilience than what most credited the sector with.

The API theme clearly is hot and that is really bringing about a bit of a market cap rotation. It is no more about the largecap names but Divi’s, Laurus Labs, Granules, Neuland Laboratories, all these names as well are propping up in the trade. Do you think the story has just begun when it comes to APIs in particular and is there more investment opportunity here.Both Ipca Lab and Laurus Labs have done pretty well. Structurally, companies like Laurus Labs are in a different phase of growth going forward. Looking at their management's con-call, clearly, they've talked about margins being sustainable going ahead. It's very heartening for us as we can be confident of the growth on top of the line.

Pharma seems to be in focus once again. It started with consumer stocks followed by IT and now again pharma is rallying. A lot of pharma stocks are at three-year highs and maybe a lot of them have made a new fresh high as well. I think the pharma party will continue as we see that wherever there is clarity on the earnings, those sectors have been doing well. Pharma is one of them. Most of the pharma earnings have been better or in line with Street estimates. A lot of largecap pharma names like Sun Pharma, Lupin have underperformed vis-à-vis the other pharma stocks. So, there could be some more catch up in those stocks. Large cap pharma names should lead the rally going forward from here.

How do you read into the overall ARPU and the provisions that the company has made for AGR dues?Bharti results were more or less in line and if you exclude the one-time loss, the overall internals were as per Street expectations, even slightly better. Gradually value is getting created in some of the digital businesses and going ahead, on a longer term basis, we will see PE getting rerated. Bharti has been making some amount of profit if you exclude the one-time loss and also the fact that there is clear cut growth as far as revenues are concerned which is not there in most of the other companies.

In separate interviews, Policybazaar co-founder Yashish Dahiya — whose company is backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd. — and MobiKwik frontman Bipin Preet Singh urged Modi to go further. Emboldened by growing hostility against its giant neighbor, they want regulators to curb their access to Indian markets, establish rules to wrest back control of user data and bankroll local startups.“China has long been the bratty kid who thinks it’s OK to grab others’ cake without sharing your own,” Dahiya told Bloomberg News last week. India must strategically reduce market access before its neighbor becomes even more powerful. “If India doesn’t do it now, it can never be done,” said Dahiya, whose online insurance service targets a 2021 IPO at a $3.5 billion value.Dahiya and Singh are breaking with tradition in an Indian startup sector that over the past half-decade has attracted billions from Chinese companies and investment houses from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Hillhouse Capital.",TCS,en,Economic Times India

What would you be looking at in the management commentary? We are expecting a 3.5% decline quarter on quarter on a constant currency basis; around 4% in dollar terms. As you rightly said, this quarter is not about how much growth they see. So even if the number is 1% worse or minus 5% than what we are anticipating, I do not think that moves anything. The key thing will be what is their commentary on the future or the outlook. If they say that quarter two onwards we will see some stability returning, then it will be a very big positive statement because global agencies have been forecasting a 7-8% decline for the full year. So if quarter two is stabilising, then we will end up the year between 0% to 2% plus or minus and it will be a much better situation than what people are expecting.

Local business clients are negligible as Chinese companies have been conservative in seeking out non-Chinese technology service providers. “Most of the Chinese firms try to do more in-house and tend to spend with local Chinese IT firms for ad-hoc needs,” said Phil Fersht, founder of HfS Research. “I expect the Indian IT majors to look at some modest pullback from China with the economic slowdown, but that could reverse after the US presidential election in November when there should be more certainty about the future and these political tensions have calmed somewhat,” he added.In fiscal year 2020, India’s largest technology services provider TCS had revenue of Rs 772 crore and a loss of Rs 3 crore from China.",TCS,en,Economic Times India

It is still doing quite well,” Gopinathan said. “Its relevance will increase significantly as we go into a distributed operating model.”Ignio is part of TCS-owned Digitate and helps companies reduce outages by identifying potential hotspots for failure in their networks.“The ability to look forward and predict where the hotspot is, the ability to look backwards and say where the core problem is, is one of the critical features of Ignio,” Gopinathan added. “Now, take that into a distributed operating model of an enterprise, because when you're using that for a server, you could as well use it for any distributed asset or any distributed resource that the enterprise has.”Ignio was expanded from Ignio AIOps to include four other products in the last year.It was a central product in the software exporter’s large deals in the previous fiscal year, said chief operating officer NG Subramaniam.“At the core is Ignio, our cognitive automation software, which can autonomously pre-empt or resolve system failures…The benefits were especially visible in the retail vertical during the holiday season peak and again during the panic shopping in March,” he said.Analysts said the market for such ‘self-healing’ software products will become bigger due to new work arrangements caused by the Covid-19 virus outbreak.IBM introduced its Watson AIOps last month, while Infosys' NIA and Wipro’s Holmes compete for market share.",TCS,en,Economic Times India

Most Tata-watchers had settled to a new life under Tata Sons chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran’s leadership. The ship seemed to have steadied itself after the tumultuous months following Cyrus Mistry’s ouster as Tata Group chairman in late 2016. Public memory is short. But court trials take their own course. Hence, when the NCLAT order finally came earlier this week, it was a bolt from the blue for the public at large, and an unexpected reversal for the Tata Group. The court has partially suspended the verdict for four weeks, considering the size of Tata Group, and the need for smooth functioning of business. It is a tense few weeks ahead, which have the potential to spiral into longer uncertainties. Nevertheless, Mistry is to be immediately reinstated on the board of Tata Sons and of the listed group companies.",TCS,en,The Economic Times India

So, we’ve seen 30% (of the deals) move to maybe more than the fourth quarter, and some in the second half than we had originally anticipated… (many) are slipping into fiscal 2021 — early part of fiscal 2021 right now,” Saleh told analysts in a post-earnings conference call.Despite overall growth in outsourcing spends in the Americas region and Apac in the third quarter, spending on managed services contracts were low compared to spends on as-a-service (cloud-based solutions) deals, which saw a rise across industries, according to technology research and advisory firm ISG.“Overall, clients are skeptical about whether to invest in technology for growth or leveraging it for cost reduction and hence the uncertainty for large-sized deals. (We have) also come across some deals where clients have put the contract process on hold, though not explicitly stating the reason,"" said Mrinal Rai, principal analyst at ISG.India’s largest IT services company Tata Consultancy Services also flagged delayed deals as one reason for slower growth in the second quarter.",TCS,en,The Economic Times India

2019-10-13 21:15:11-05:00,Analysts credit stater acquisition for Infosys posting better numbers than TCS,"BENGALURU: Analysts are crediting an acquisition for Infosys’ better than-expected performance in the July-September quarter, when the IT services firm outpaced larger rival Tata Consultancy Services in revenue growth.Excluding the incremental revenue from Stater, the mortgage services unit of ABN AMRO Bank, that it acquired earlier this year, Infosys’ revenue growth from the banking and financial services (BFS) segment underperformed compared to TCS, they said.BFS is one of the biggest revenue segments for Indian IT companies like TCS, Infosys and Wipro. On Thursday, Mumbai-headquartered TCS reported a muted performance in the retail and banking serves segments, even as its revenue underperformed expectations. Infosys, on the other hand, on Friday posted strong growth in banking and financial services and raised the bottom-end of its revenue target for fiscal 2020 — its new forecast is for 9-10% growth, compared with 8.5-10% earlier.“If you peel off the inorganic contribution from Stater for Infosys, the June 2019 year-on-year organic constant currency growth of Infosys was approximately 9.3% (vs TCS at 9.2%, on a much bigger base) and the September 2019 year-onyear organic constant currency growth of Infosys was below 6.0% (vs nearly 8% for TCS),” said Peter Bendor-Samuel, CEO of IT advisory Everest Research.“So, barring one acquisition, which is more of a one-off, Infosys’ financial services has actually underperformed that of TCS (and that too on a smaller base),” Bendor-Samuel added.",TCS,en,The Economic Times India

2019-10-11 22:14:32-05:00,Infosys vs TCS: How they stack up now,"ET Intelligence Group: The September 2019 quarter performance of Infosys affirms that the country’s second-largest software company appears to be on course to report a double-digit growth in dollar-denominated revenue for the current fiscal. This would be after a gap of six years — the last time it had reported a double-digit growth was back in FY14 when its revenue had grown by 11.5%. Infosys will also likely report higher top line growth than Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the biggest peer.In the first half of FY20, Infosys increased its revenue by 10.2% to $6,341 million. That puts the company into a comfortable position to clock above 10% growth for the full fiscal. This also makes the company’s revised revenue FY20 guidance of 9-10% growth sound too conservative. A sequential growth of around 2.3% in each of the remaining two quarters would help the company march past the upper end of its guidance. This looks achievable given the 2.3% and 2.5% sequential growth in the June and the September quarters, respectively, and the sustained momentum in order flow from clients. 71549815 At a time when TCS is undergoing a deceleration in growth momentum, Infosys appears to be back on the growth track.",TCS,en,The Economic Times India

Purely on technicals, what do you make of this big downfall on Nifty?We were lucky that either the fall was not exacerbated because on Monday the kind of selloff which we had seen, we expected a lot of follow through for the markets because it was 500-400 points down on the Nifty in just a matter of one or two trading sessions. That probably leaves a very sharp impact to the near term trend. At a time you were trading at 12,000 levels comfortably till previous week, the near term outlook looks a bit grimmer for the index. I believe there are technical factors which are indicating that the index could head back and close that election gap or the exit poll gap of 11,400 pretty soon.

From Sunday, India imposed higher tariffs on some US goods, days after Washington withdrew a key trade privilege for New Delhi.Two senior Indian government officials said on Wednesday they were briefed last week on a US government plan to cap H-1B visas issued each year to Indians at between 10% and 15% of the annual quota.There is no current country-specific limit on the 85,000 H-1B work visas granted each year and an estimated 70% go to Indians.Both officials said they were told the plan was linked to the global push for ""data localisation"", in which a country places restrictions on data as a way to gain better control over it and potentially curb the power of international companies.",TCS,en,The Economic Times India

You can avoid a few spaces which have underperformed but the market texture is telling you a completely different thing. In January-February, the Indian markets underperformed the global markets. The Asian markets especially saw a very strong rally. Then there was the catch-up in performance. When you see a new trend in the making, the market generally latches on to one sector and where the focus gets driven into. For this rally, the Bank Nifty was one of the stronger sectors. Auto has underperformed, cement is trying to show some bit of rally, metal stocks or metal sector is still trying to struggle with a lot of global headwinds but banking stocks and Bank Nifty overall is one of the key sectors.",TCS,en,The Economic Times India

Issues are typically settled mutually and there are very few instances when it reaches the courts. In the past, Wipro was sued by client National Grid and it paid $75 million to settle the case in 2018. In 2016, Tata Consultancy Services paid $26 million to settle a case with US district Orange County.Crawford’s suit against Cognizant is related to an enterprise resource planning (ERP) project that initially began in 2014 and was plagued by problems that peaked in 2018. ET has a copy of the filing.“Cognizant failed to perform as promised under the Work Schedules. And, because the purpose of PeopleSoft Financials was to operate the entirety of Crawford’s finances, the damages resulting from Cognizant’s failure have been severe,” the lawsuit filed in February with the Georgia Northern District Court said. “The combination of poor coding standards and insufficient testing resulted in multi-million dollar revenue recognition problems and a multi-million dollar effect on the bottom line,” the suit added.Crawford said complaints were made not only by Crawford’s project manager but its chief global information officer and its chief operating officer also escalated the pro-blem. “Crawford had worked with Cognizant for years in good faith to implement PeopleSoft Financials.In 2018, as the second phase of implementation experienced greater problems, with no remedy from Cognizant, Crawford tried to resolve the problems with Cognizant’s work,” the suit said.In October 2018, the company told Cognizant it was transferring the work to another provider.",TCS,en,The Economic Times India
