The bankrupt utility is struggling to secure its grid from causing more deadly wildfires, and has been stymied in attempts to set up natural gas-backed microgrids to power substations during fire-prevention blackouts. But California regulators are adamant that PG&E find a more permanent and less costly and polluting backup plan in the years ahead — even if it’s not clear yet what form it may take. On June 11, the California Public Utilities Commission plans to vote on a proposed decision that would greenlight PG&E’s plan to secure up to 450 megawatts of mobile generators to back up communities during public safety power outage events this summer and fall. PG&E’s “Temporary Generation Plan” is a major expansion from its use of mobile generators last year, when forced switch-off events blacked out millions of Northern California residents, some for days at a time.",ETN,en,Green Technology (Feed)

Google’s “carbon-intelligent computing platform” pilot project taps the flexibility of when data centers schedule “non-urgent” tasks, such as processing YouTube videos and adding new words to Google Translate, to match that work to when wind, solar and other carbon-free resources are at their peak generation capacity on the grid that powers them. The latest results from an unnamed data center “demonstrate carbon-aware load shifting works,” Ana Radovanovic, Google’s technical lead for carbon-intelligent computing, wrote in a blog post this week.
