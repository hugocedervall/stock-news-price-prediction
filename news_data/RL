This week, a group of unions and nongovernmental organizations called on major brands like Nike, Adidas and Amazon to stop sourcing goods from Xinjiang. While the U.S. has already introduced some sanctions over Xinjiang, Bütikofer complained that the European Commission is still resisting pressure to take action.

On the plus side, crude has really turned things around this week, with front-month crude futures (/CL) starting the day around $54 a barrel.

Evan Agostini/Invision/AP Flop: Ui, ui, ui: Bella Hadid hat sich voll und ganz den Achtzigerjahren verschrieben und die werden ja auch gerne als Jahrzehnt des ""Bad Taste"" bezeichnet. Vielleicht hatte das (immer dünner werdende) Topmodel bei dieser Award-Verleihung aber auch einfach keine Zeit mehr, um etwas drüberzuziehen. EPA/SEBASTIEN NOGIER Top: Dass Bella ab und zu dann doch mit ihrer Garderobe überzeugen kann, bewies sie bei den Festspielen in Cannes. Am besten sieht Hadid aber auf den unzähligen Laufstegen aus, die sie betritt - wenn jemand anderes fürs Outfit verantwortlich ist. APA/AFP/GETTY IMAGES/Gabriel Olsen Flop: Sienna Miller gilt seit Jahren zu Recht als Stilikone. Und auch ihr Satin-Hosenanzug in Creme von Cong Tri ist wieder einmal total angesagt. Der Schnitt ist oversize, wir verstehen. Und dennoch: Die Schauspielerin wirkt in dem maßgeschneiderten Anzug verloren, etwas gestaucht und gepaart mit der offenen Wallemähne sieht sie zu sehr nach Pyjamaparty aus.",RL,de,Kurier.at

Als Ehefrau des jüngeren der beiden Royal-Brüder wird Meghan im Gegensatz zu Kate nie zur Königin aufsteigen. Vom Modethron hat die 38-Jährige ihre Schwägerin jedoch längst geschubst. Laut einer aktuellen Analyse der Modesuchmaschine Lyst, war Meghan 2019 die einflussreichste Stilikone. Kate landete deutlich abgeschlagen auf Platz 11. Was die Herzogin von Sussex trägt, schlägt sich sofort im Interesse der Modefans nieder: Durchschnittlich 216 Prozent Zuwachs bei Suchanfragen auf ähnliche Artikel wurden heuer verzeichnet, sobald sich Meghan in der Öffentlichkeit blicken ließ – das schafften nicht einmal Hollywood-Stars oder Social-Media-Giganten wie Kylie Jenner (die übrigens auf Platz 2 landete).
