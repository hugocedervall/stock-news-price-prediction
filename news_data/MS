The deal comes as the once high-flying HNA Group, which owns the Hainan Airlines, sheds assets under a restructuring programme to resolve liquidity risks stemming from years of aggressive acquisitions abroad. In September, the cash-strapped group's chairman was barred from taking flights and high-speed trains and going on vacations due to its failure to pay a court-ordered US$5,300 in a lawsuit. HNA acquired Ingram, which distributes products ranging from Apple Inc's iPhones to Cisco's network equipment, in 2016 in a US$6 billion deal. The sale will help HNA Technology, a listed arm of the group, to repay the principal and interest on M&A loans and related debt, as well as to reduce expenses and ease liquidity pressure, the unit said in a regulatory filing with the Shanghai Stock Exchange.",MS,en,The Sun Daily

In its inaugural annual ESG review Wilis Owen found a near doubling of returns compared to non-ESG mandates in the IA Global sector. On average in the global sector, ESG funds delivered a return of 22.3% this year, versus the IA Global sector average of 13.2%. ESG funds also outperformed in the UK All Companies sector and UK Equity Income sector, although to a less degree. The global pandemic has altered the investment landscape in 2020, said Willis Owen, and led to global and domestic-focused ESG mandates outperforming peers, the firm’s data shows. Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at Willis Owen, said the out-performance was due in part to the underperformance of some less ESG-friendly sectors such as oil and gas, financials and airlines but a sustainable focus and governance elements have helped long-term investment performance of ESG funds.",MS,en,Financial Planning Today

Today, that address represents the heart of Manhattan’s financial district: One block north of Wall Street and one block south of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Goldman Sachs Asset Management, by contrast, was formed in 1988.This difference is important context to keep in mind after reading the scoop from Bloomberg News’s Sridhar Natarajan that Goldman is considering a new Florida hub to house its asset-management division. The news naturally set off alarms about the end of New York City as the undisputed financial capital of the U.S., given the surprise decision by AllianceBernstein Holding LP in 2018 to move its headquarters to Nashville and, more recently, the increased presence of Blackstone Group Inc. and Citadel in the Sunshine State.Make no mistake: Goldman is a powerhouse in asset management, managing $1.46 trillion as of the end of the third quarter, up 19% from a year earlier and more than Morgan Stanley’s investment management division stands to oversee even after the bank acquires Eaton Vance Corp.",MS,en,Yahoo Finance

According to a recent survey from Bank of America, half of fund managers favour emerging markets more than any other asset class for 2021. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has risen by nearly 13 per cent in November. Emerging market debt is also growing in popularity, with EPFR data showing flows of USD3.5 billion into EM bonds during one week in November, the fourth largest weekly inflows ever. “EMD remains a relatively popular asset class for institutional investors globally,” writes the emerging markets debt team of US asset manager Eaton Vance. “The irony, however, is that fund flows in the sector are still driven by index-based strategies that ignore fundamentals, even as many investors have come to recognise just how crucial individual EM country fundamentals will be in surmounting Covid-19 challenges.” Benchmark-based approaches “may be sub-optimal”, warns Eaton Vance, adding that indexes are often highly concentrated, with ten countries accounting for 80 per cent of JP Morgan’s Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets’ index weighting.",MS,en,InstitutionAlassetManager

The Dallas-headquartered firm is co-founded by alt-credit veterans Mark Okada, who will serve as CEO; Jack Yang, the firm’s president and head of business development; and chief investment officer Trey Parker. Sycamore Tree, which also has an office in New York, will initially focus on traded credit, structured products and special situations, drawing on the trio’s “deep experience across multiple cycles”. The trio said credit has become integral to asset allocation models in a sustained low growth and low rate environment, and believe “now more than ever, experienced and reliable managers, who can navigate complexity, manage risk and identify value, are essential” in light of 2020’s unique landscape. “We plan to invest in value-oriented opportunities arising from uncertainty around when we will return to a ‘new normal’,” Okada said in an email comment to Hedgeweek. “The timing depends not only on whether a vaccine is approved, but also on vaccine uptake.” A high-profile veteran of loan and credit markets of some 35 years, Okada co-founded multi-billion dollar credit and CLO specialist Highland Capital Management in 1990, where was also chief investment officer.",MS,en,Hedgeweek

Influenced by the investment styles of the likes of Joel Greenblatt, Warren Buffett and Ray Dalio, Ironhold combines elements of stock market value investing with currency hedging into one strategy, explains Siddarth Singhai, the firm’s chief investment officer. Specifically, the strategy – co-founded by Singhai along with CEO Paul Gray - builds long-term bets on value names, with the portfolio split more or less evenly between US and Indian companies. At the same time, currency movements in the Indian rupee against the US dollar then leads the fund’s Indian exposures to serve essentially as portfolio hedges. Singhai tells Hedgeweek that while the US dollar is perennially stable, serving as the world’s reserve currency and not subject to major devaluations or foreign debt moves, India’s economy remains heavily dependent on foreign investors. “If they pull out their money, then all the business and spending they were financing in India dries up.",MS,en,Hedgeweek

This article will look at the similarities and differences between ESG investment guidelines and long standing principles of investment practiced under Shariah law and discuss the implications of such restrictions for fund finance. In the context of capital call facilities, where investors are unwilling to participate in certain investments due to ESG or Shariah law concerns, these investor restrictions (and the related excuse rights bestowed on such investors) can impact how lenders evaluate investors for purposes of calculating a borrowing base. ‘ Shariah’, which literally translates from Arabic as ‘the path to water’, is a set of principles derived from Islamic sources including the Quran and Sunnah which govern all areas of life, including financial transactions in the Muslim community.",MS,en,PrivateEquityWire

As Salesforce grew in popularity, more companies adopted that same model of selling software on a monthly, per user, or usage basis, a model often called software-as-a-service or SaaS. While software engineers are key to actually building these cloud-based products, customer facing roles like sales, marketing, and business development are equally important to companies' success. So what do top cloud software companies like Salesforce, Slack, Atlassian, and others pay their top non-tech workers? Federal data gives some insight: American companies have to disclose salaries when they apply for visas for current or prospective foreign workers. The Office of Foreign Labor Certification, which collects and processes those applications, publishes the salaries every year. Business Insider analyzed active foreign-worker visas at Salesforce, Slack, Atlassian, Box, Dropbox, and Okta to find out how much they each pays workers in sales, marketing, and business development roles.",MS,en,Business Insider

I am an Enemy to all banks discounting bills, or notes for anything but Coin. If the American People allow private banks to control the issuance of their currency, first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the People of all their Property until their Children will wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered.” – Thomas Jefferson.

2020-10-14 03:21:53-05:00,Wave of consolidation in asset management expected to increase pressure on ‘squeezed’ mid-size firms,"Wave of consolidation in asset management expected to increase pressure on ‘squeezed’ mid-size firms Submitted By Madeleine Taylor | 14/10/2020 - 9:21am A new wave of consolidation has started sweeping the asset management industry, and is expected to accelerate as sharper fee compression and rising costs turn up the pressure on investment firms. This month, US investment bank Morgan Stanley revealed plans to buy investment manager Eaton Vance, in a move that will almost double its assets under management to USD1.2 trillion. “Eaton Vance is a perfect fit for Morgan Stanley,” said James P Gorman, chairman and chief executive officer of Morgan Stanley, at the time of the announcement. Gorman explained that Morgan Stanley sees it as an opportunity to add more fee-based revenues and boost assets under management. Bing Waldert, managing director of US research at asset management research firm Cerulli Associates, says investment managers are looking to gain greater market share as their profits come under increasing threat. “The overarching theme is continued compression of fees in the asset management marketplace,” says Waldert. “At a top line, that means the revenue that an asset manager is able to raise, but as you start to dig deeper, it's also about costs in a stricter regulatory environment.” Allocators are “looking to engage with fewer partners on a deeper level”, which means their expectations for asset manager relationships are going up, and the fees they expect to pay are going down.",MS,en,InstitutionAlassetManager

Here are the 11 deals the bank says are most likely.,"Summary List Placement Hammered by a collapse in oil prices, the energy industry is entering a new phase focused on returns, which is likely to bring a wave of consolidation, analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note Wednesday. Deals could help US oil companies Exxon and Chevron diversify and build out their clean-energy assets, they said. ""European peers have begun to reposition portfolios away from oil & gas production,"" the analysts said in the note. ""Majors in the US have been slower to adapt despite sharing similar advantages of scale. Focusing on M&A in the power sector, companies with renewable development capabilities could be particularly attractive alternatives to oil & gas."" Today, the energy industry remains fragmented, the analysts said, resulting in a recent spike in deals. Most notably, Chevron acquired Noble Energy in early October through a $5 billion all-stock deal, while shale giants Devon Energy and WPX Energy announced plans to merge in late September.

Outros cerca de US$ 20 bilhões em papéis com vencimento em 2035 caíram para 35 centavos por dólar na semana passada e agora estão em 37 centavos.

It meant that anyone continuing to bet on a high carbon future was tacitly accusing governments of either being incapable of delivering on their stated goal or engaged in a global conspiracy to deceive the public about their true intentions.

The global economy has been on a strong run since its historic contraction last quarter, and the V-shaped recovery has played out even faster than we initially expected. Since Covid-19 was a common exogenous shock to economies worldwide, its economic impact has tracked the timeline from the start of lockdown measures to the lifting of these restrictions. As all economies are now reopening, economic output is on the road to pre-Covid-19 levels, with some already there but others still lagging. The area where the pace of recovery has remained weak is the emerging economies outside China (EMXC), which account for roughly 25% of global nominal dollar GDP.

Moulle-Berteaux, head of the global multi-asset team, offered another view. ""The contrarian view is Biden turns out to be okay for the market because it means a lot of stimulus. Right now the markets seem to be rewarding countries that are able to come through with stimulus, particularly if it doesn't mean higher interest rates,"" he said. ""And it is likely that he would focus on the spending parts of his package initially — because we're dealing with the relatively weak economic activity still — rather than the taxing components of his policies."" However, Moulle-Berteaux has no plans to invest this early on in ""very short-term things unless we have very high conviction and that we have a different view than the consensus."" ""So we've tried to look forward to what's likely to happen in 2021 rather than focusing on the immediate impact of the election,"" he said.",MS,en,Business Insider

Prior to merging as Truist, BB&T and SunTrust had invested in startups developing products for cloud-based core banking, consumer-facing payments, data management, and digital banking . Cloud-based core provider nCino, which is now public, is listed as a former portfolio company. This is a baby step in the bank's post-merger integration. In February 2019, soon after BB&T and SunTrust announced their merger, they committed to a $100 million ""technology and innovation"" budget and planned a technology hub in Charlotte, North Carolina. But the innovation center and associated venture arm are just two small components of the bank's $66 billion deal . Given the merger's many moving parts, its focus on technological innovation risks getting lost as the dust settles.

Bank is booking profits basis earnings of fee income, savings on net interest income, productivity gains and reduction in costs due to its digital only nature.“Hiving YONO off as a subsidiary is a very good possibility but a couple of things have to be done, we should have APIs that could be given to other banks but first looking at the opportunities with our customer base we want to perfect that and then look outside,” said Kumar.The bank which has a customer base of 49 crore processes atleast 4 lakh transactions on its digital offerings on a daily basis. 55% of the bank’s transactions are currently being conducted through the digital channel and half of it is contributed by YONO.“No doubt SBIs YONO platform is quite world class but it will not be value accretive as long as it is under the SBI roof, look at SBI cards it is one of the best valued NBFCs today,” said Siddharth Purohit, analyst, SMC Institutional Equities. “So, if tomorrow SBI decides to hive YONO off as a subsidiary the market will determine its value basis that.”ET had recently reported that Yes Bank had valued its digital channel at nearly $7 billion.",MS,en,Economic Times India

2020-09-15 07:15:00-05:00,Morgan Stanley pinpoints the most attractive opportunity it sees for investors as a new bull run takes shape — and shares 3 strategies for generating market-beating returns,"Summary List Placement With the end of COVID-19 nowhere near, it is hard to believe that the stock market is well into another bull run and the economy has entered into a new cycle. Mike Wilson, the chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, is among those who are optimistic about both . In a recent note, he said he expects a V-shaped economic recovery and its ripple effects on the stock market to persist so long as (1) people continue to adapt to the ""new patterns of living and consumption"" brought on by the pandemic, and (2) the Federal Reserve and government continue to provide sufficient monetary and fiscal support. Given such a macro backdrop, Wilson believes the new bull market will be driven by higher earnings based on a mix of company sales growth and operating leverage. In addition, his team was especially encouraged to see the median S&P 500 company cut their cost of goods sold as well as selling, general, and administrative expenses by 5.4% in the second quarter. He thinks this ""sets the stage for better profits next year as the economy and topline recover."" While earnings are likely to rise steadily, the combination of higher long-term rates and lower equity risk premiums (the returns investors get for taking on higher risks in the market) could bring price-to-earnings multiples lower, making valuations a headwind for earnings growth, the strategist warned.",MS,en,Business Insider

While many of the services are overtly branded to appeal to a younger generation, research by Deutsche Bank indicates that robo-advisor clients are on average in their mid-40s. With their low fees and deposit minimums, robo-advisors have opened up savings and investments to a new realm of investors — and can work for the more experienced as well. But are they right for you?

From in-store layaway to store-branded credit cards, retailers have always used financing as a way to convert browsers to buyers.

O euro se valorizou cerca de 12% desde que a turbulência trazida pelo coronavírus abalou os mercados em março, sustentado pelas medidas implementadas pela União Europeia e pela expectativa de que o banco central americano (Federal Reserve) manterá os juros nas mínimas que enfraquecem o dólar. Fundos de hedge agora apostam em outro salto da taxa de câmbio para US$ 1,25 por euro após as eleições nos EUA, nível também previsto pelo Goldman Sachs Group. As negociações no mercado de opções fizeram deste mês o agosto de maior otimismo com o euro até hoje. O movimento é parte de uma tendência mais ampla que levou estrategistas da Mizuho International a conferir ao euro o título de rei das moedas — um elogio normalmente reservado ao dólar — à medida que a incerteza em torno da eleição presidencial dos EUA em novembro reforça o interesse por ativos europeus. “Há tempo de sobra para o tema Rei Euro”, disse Peter Chatwell, chefe de estratégia multiativos da Mizuho. “Ele pode competir com o dólar para ser a moeda ocidental de escolha para fins comerciais e pode competir de forma mais geral com outras moedas consideradas seguras por ser reserva confiável de capital no longo prazo.” O dólar caiu para o menor patamar em dois anos após o presidente do Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, permitir inflação mais elevada nos EUA.",MS,pt,Valor Econômico

Its landmark report, ""The New Plastics Economy"" (PDF), sounded the alarm in 2016 that if ""business as usual"" continues, by 2025 the ocean may hold more plastic than fish by weight. Its commitment by the same name has attracted many of the planet's biggest brand names, among 450-plus signatories, to dramatically slash their use or production of plastic by 2025. PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, Unilever and even Tupperware have signed on with governments and NGOs to do away with ""unnecessary"" plastics and innovate so that other plastics will be reused, recycled or composted; and kept out of natural systems. Only five years ago, few corporate leaders had plastic pollution on their official radar. Yet Dame Ellen MacArthur herself is floored by the rapid pace of change in business that has been forced by the COVID-19 pandemic.",MS,en,GreenBiz

A avaliação é dos estrategistas Andres Jaime e Ioana Zamfir, do Morgan Stanley, cuja recomendação para o “miolo” da curva, mais especificamente o contrato de DI para janeiro de 2023, é “overweight” (acima da média do mercado), “porque acreditamos que o mercado está subestimando a intenção do BC de influenciar o miolo da curva por meio do forward guidance”. Em relatório enviado a clientes, os estrategistas do banco americano afirmam que, além da questão fiscal, desafios relativos ao financiamento do governo também podem ter impacto sobre a curva de juros. “Embora nossa análise mostre que as necessidades de financiamento devem ser administráveis em 2020, a perspectiva para 2021 é mais incerta e os riscos seriam direcionados para um volume ainda maior de emissões.",MS,pt,Valor Econômico

She identified three trades she's making that potentially have more upside than the crowded tech sector. Click here to sign up for our weekly newsletter Investing Insider . Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . In a market dominated by technology stocks in recent months, Margaret Vitrano, a portfolio manager at ClearBridge Investments, sees fewer and fewer opportunities in the sector. Given the high price multiples in tech, she's instead turning her attention toward consumer-oriented stocks. Vitrano is basing these plays on increases in consumer spending as the US economy reopens. At a July 16 webinar hosted by Legg Mason Global Asset Management, Vitrano broke down where exactly she sees opportunities as the US economy recovers to pre-pandemic levels. Asked about specific companies she recommends, Vitrano, who manages $47 billion for ClearBridge Investments, said Booking.com ( BKNG ) is among those at the top of her list. ""The thing we like about Booking.com is its highly variable cost structure — so they have a balance sheet to support them if this lasts several years,"" she said.

Probably no financial question is more important, or more poorly defined. The intensity of investor debate over which letter the economy will resemble, with no broad agreement on what those letters mean, remains a major challenge. Morgan Stanley’s forecast for a V-shaped recovery has US and DM growth returning to pre-recession levels by 4Q21, faster than consensus and much faster than the recuperation from the global financial crisis. But it will still be 18 months before growth returns to normal; even a V-shaped recovery takes time. That slog would seem to stand in sharp contrast to action in the financial markets, which, free to look ahead, have roared back from the lows. Global equities are up almost 40% since late March, causing a healthy amount of scepticism that “markets have run ahead of the fundamentals”.",MS,en,Zero Hedge

Now, he's found a buyer for his Bel-Air mansion : a Chinese billionaire who seems to be happy forking over $29 million to Musk for the home. The buyer is tied to billionaire William Ding, according to Business Insider , who is the founder and CEO of NetEase. Ignoring the fact that it's odd for Musk to be offloading his assets at the same time Tesla's valuation is at, or near, all time highs of ~$185 billion , Musk was able to cash out with a $12 million profit on this home (which he bought for $17 million 2012) in the midst of a real estate market that is enduring chaos from both the supply and the demand side as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Even stranger was that we took the time to note in our early May writeup that according to Bloomberg: ""Fewer buyers were coming from China, Russia and the Middle East amid international tensions, and limits on state and local tax deductions dampened the appeal of owning California homes for wealthy U.S. buyers.""

Behind the scenes, however, the Treasury’s responsibilities have fallen largely to the 42-year-old deputy secretary, Justin Muzinich. A major beneficiary of that bailout so far: Muzinich & Co., the asset manager founded by his father where Justin served as president before joining the administration. He reported owning a stake worth at least $60 million when he entered government in 2017. Today, Muzinich retains financial ties to the firm through an opaque transaction in which he transferred his shares in the privately held company to his father. Ethics experts say the arrangement is troubling because his father received the shares for no money up front, and it appears possible that Muzinich can simply get his stake back after leaving government.",MS,en,Zero Hedge

There was another bizarre aspect to 2019: it was a year when despite the blockbuster overall return of the S&P, ""bullish"" strategies actually underperformed. Now, in his year in review weekly, Goldman's David Kostin makes some observations of his own, and reaches a similar conclusion to that from Morgan Stanley. For one the S&P 500, which soared started in early October, just around the time the Fed launched QE4, reached 35 new all-time highs last year, with 20 of those days coming in the last two months.

Shown visually, the problem roughly reduces to the following: corporate debt has doubled from $5 trillion in 2007 to $9.5 trillion halfway through 2019 with corporate debt-to-GDP now back to levels which traditionally presage a recession. Amid this massive debt increase, the principal risk is that the biggest growth was that in BBB-rated debt (which now amounts to over $3.2 trillion ), is just one downgrade away from junk, and is also why many skeptics have been warning of a barrage of ""fallen angels"" before or during the next recession.",MS,en,Zero Hedge

2019-07-15 01:16:43-05:00,Why Budweiser and its bankers failed to sell the king of IPOs,"By Thomas Buckley, Bruce Einhorn and Crystal TseFor months, executives from Anheuser-Busch InBev NV raced to prepare for a listing of its Asian subsidiary, Budweiser Brewing Company APAC. It was to be this year’s biggest initial public offering and would surpass Uber Technologies Inc.’s $8.1 billion share sale.The hope had been that the Belgian company’s leading position in the premium beer market in China -- with its millions of drinkers -- would justify a target to raise as much as $9.8 billion, for a valuation of $64 billion. But on Friday, AB InBev discovered that wasn’t enough to convince investors to splurge on the King of Beers, forcing it to dial back its ambitions and shelve plans for the mammoth IPO in Hong Kong.AB InBev’s setback can be explained at least partly by shifting trends in China, where younger consumers are increasingly moving away from traditional beers toward higher-priced craft brews and cocktails. Meanwhile, competition in China is spiking after rival Heineken NV forged a blockbuster deal with a state-owned company.",MS,en,The Economic Times India

The plaintiffs, four iPhone users, allege that Apple unlawfully monopolized the App Store through a number of practices. Apple charges developers up to 30% for sales made in the App Store, a cost that the suit claims is often passed on to consumers via markups. And, since rivals are barred from competing for these users outside the platform — iPhone users can only purchase apps via the App Store — the lawsuit argues a higher than competitive pricing structure is being created.",MS,en,Business Insider

The price hike would come as the smartphone industry grapples with slowing sales worldwide. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

However, the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs deemed cannabis as an illegal drug back in 1961. Originally, the treaty intended to cover drugs such as opium, coca, and others such as morphine, heroin, and cocaine. Unfortunately, cannabis was classified under the group of narcotics because of its psychoactive effects. However, the convention does recognize the medical use and research of certain drugs. Typically, drugs such as opioids are heavily prevalent within medical institutions as they are primarily used to treat moderate to severe chronic pain. However, extensive research has suggested that cannabis can be an effective alternative to opioids. Moreover, researchers have also linked cannabis to effectively treating a variety of medical conditions such as cancer, depression, arthritis, MS, AIDS, Alzheimer's, and Tourette's.",MS,en,Benzinga

Flipkart’s group CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy said in an exclusive interview to ET — his first since tightened FDI rules for the sector came into effect in February — that the online retail market in India is thinly penetrated and quite a few problems would need solving to make it sizeable.“We believe if more players operate in this space, it will further expand the market and benefit all the stakeholders, like kirana stores, small and medium-sized merchants and consumers who will gain from innovation in the sector,” he said.Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries is expected to shake up the country’s online retail market when it launches later this year, and the group has already started pulling out own brands — across apparel, lifestyle and other categories — from online marketplaces of potential competitors including Flipkart and Amazon, ET reported earlier.Jeff Bezos’ Amazon and Flipkart have been the two leading players in the Indian ecommerce market, which is expected to touch $200 billion in size by 2027, according to estimates by Morgan Stanley.",MS,en,The Economic Times India

That growth has come at the expense of the conglomerate’s energy-related arms, which have been the bedrock of Ambani’s business for more than a decade. Their revenue share dropped to 77 percent from 83 percent, the data show.Asia’s richest man has ambitions to take on Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc. in India, where the power of the middle class is growing along with demand for e-commerce.

The former chairman of media giant Vivendi SA was implicated in a bribery scandal in Africa, his electric car-sharing program in Paris shut down, and he’s losing a battle for control of Telecom Italia—the troubled carrier at the heart of his plan to create a southern European entertainment juggernaut. He faces a further potential blow at Vivendi’s annual meeting on April 15, where proxy advisory firms are recommending that shareholders reject a measure that would let Bolloré increase his control of the company. Despite the setbacks, help is on the way—from Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, and U2. Vivendi is planning to sell a 49 percent stake in Universal Music Group, the world’s biggest recording house.

IndusInd Bank and HDFC Bank have their current chiefs reaching the RBI age cap over the next year and half, said analysts.“We believe that an extension in age limit, if it happens, will only plug the regulatory gap between the corporate sector and banks,” said Motilal Oswal analyst Nitin Agarwal. “Recent management changes in Yes Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank show that the RBI exercises stricter vigilance on banks as compared to the corporate sector (regulator),” Agarwal said.

Frigon's fund has soared 22% over the past year, putting it in the 95th percentile relative to competitors. It's not lost on Gerry Frigon that there are roughly half as many public companies now compared to 15 years ago. For a money manager like him, that's made it doubly difficult to find market-beating investment opportunities. But if recent results are any indication, that hasn't stopped him from reaping impressive returns. Frigon is the lead manager of the Taylor Frigon Core Growth Fund , which recently cracked Kiplinger's top 10 ranking for mutual funds . According to Bloomberg data, the fund has soared 22% and beaten 95% of its peers over past year, nearly doubling the benchmark S&P 500 over that period. Frigon — who is also president and chief investment officer at Taylor Frigon Capital Management, where he oversees $200 million — attributes this to a strategy that involves looking for largely undiscovered early-stage companies.

According to the Fed Funds market, whereas odds of any futures hikes are now 0, the market sees a 25% probability of a rate cut at the Fed's January 2020 meeting. Others are even more aggressive, and are confident that the Fed's may resume QE as soon as next year, as Bloomberg detailed in "" Bond Investors Are Daring to Whisper About a Return to Fed QE.

Price action and positioning suggest investors are heading into the meeting on the short side when it comes to the common currency, as they expect lower growth and inflation projections. For Draghi to sound more dovish than the market, he would need to change guidance that “rates will remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019” or hint that such a shift is due next month.

And, as we have discussed in recent weeks, one main reason for this lingering skepticism is that a majority of investors are confident that contrary to the constant media cheerleading, what we are experiencing is nothing more than a bear market rally prompted by fresh speculation about ""green shoots"" and ""reflation"". Addressing this point, BofA's CIO Michael Hartnett last week noted that in Japan between 1990 and 2003 there were no less than 13 equity trading rallies that exceeded 20%, and seven trading rallies that exceeded 33%, all the while Nikkei was caught in a secular bear market.

As a result, stocks delivered strong gains despite soft earnings delivery and lukewarm guidance — a contrast to prior quarters when companies delivered strong beats but investors were unfazed, mostly thanks to low equity leverage/positioning at start of the reporting season.

2019-03-03 18:55:46-05:00,Morgan Stanley: Q1 Will Mark The Trough Of This Mini-Cycle... And Central Banks May Resume Tightening,"One month ago, Morgan Stanley whose chief US equity strategist Michael Wilson had long been one of the biggest bears on Wall Street, said that the US is headed for an earnings recession not just in Q1 2019, but perhaps for the entire year, as consensus earnings estimates for 2019 were just too high. And, in a concession to Morgan Stanley's more bullish clients, Wilson cut his full year EPS forecast for 2019 from 4.3% to a token 1.0%, just barely above calling the entire year a wash from an earnings perspective (although he did bump up his PE multiple assumptions). And while Wilson was ahead of the curve in calling roa recession, it now appears that Morgan Stanley may also be calling the inflection point, when in its Sunday Start note, the bank's chief economist and global head of economics, Chetan Ahya, wrote that he is increasingly ""inclined to believe that our house forecast of growth bottoming out in 1Q19, aided by a recovery in growth outside the US, is coming to fruition"" as a result of easing on three key fronts: Trade tensions easing, China’s monetary easing starting to work, and the Fed’s flexibility and patience, leading to easing in global financial conditions, all support our view that 1Q19 will mark the trough in this mini-cycle.",MS,en,Zero Hedge

There is little reason to argue the point given the bullish trend since the December 24th lows. Of course, such is not surprising given the Fed’s dovish turn from tightening monetary policy to quietly putting the “punch bowl” back on the table. But yet, this rally is occurring at a time where Europe’s earnings growth rates for the just reported Q4-period stands at a -1% annualized, which is the lowest since Q2-2016, and the U.S. is on the verge of an earnings recession as well as declining economic data.

2019-02-26 13:07:00-05:00,Morgan Stanley: Looks Like That Is Enough For Now,"By Chris Metli, Executive Director of Morgan Stanley Quant and Derivative Strategies Looks Like that is Enough for Now US price action yesterday on the back of the tariff delay was disappointing, and signals that the market may be due for a breather here . Positioning across investor bases remains just about as light as has been all year – there is no change on that front (see Market Still Wants to go Higher from Feb 13th for details). But this week a) pension funds and asset allocators likely have stock to sell (QDS estimates ~$25bn of US equity for sale over month-end) and b) vol target funds are set to slow their pace of buying as leverage creeps higher. First off, yesterday’s price action stands out on two fronts: 1) the intraday return was weak compared to the overnight gap up, indicating a lack of real money buy-in and was more reminiscent of late 2018 than the first two months of 2019 and 2) there was a notable increase in volatility with the VIX up ~1.35 points despite the SPX rising 12 bps on the day .",MS,en,Zero Hedge

To be sure, China is still an export powerhouse - after all, it is China's massive trade surplus with the US that is arguably the reason for the ongoing trade war between the US and China. However, it is China's declining trade balance with the rest of the world that is of bigger concern in this context. As a reference, China's trade surplus has shrunk by a third in just three years : in 2015, the country exported around $150 billion worth of goods more than it imported each quarter. In the third quarter of 2018, the goods trade surplus was just $100 billion.","MS,MSCI",en,Zero Hedge

2019-02-19 06:40:42-05:00,Hope Is A Dangerous Thing For This Market To Have,"Authored by Bloomberg's Justina Lee What explains the resilience of Europe’s equity recovery this year despite worsening economic data and political wobbles? The obvious candidates are the excessive sell-off in late 2018, an ECB that’s likely to stay loose for longer and optimism over U.S.-China trade talks. But when the Stoxx Europe 600 is at the highest since October, just a trade platitude away from its 200- day moving average, you’ve got to wonder how much support you can still count on from those three factors. Let’s start with trade. Trump received a report on whether imported cars could pose a national security threat on Sunday, once again raising the specter of higher U.S. auto tariffs. That should at least be a drizzle on the parade of positive comments on ongoing U.S.-China trade talks. Markets have been cheering every ostensible sign of a compromise that would at least delay the threatened increase in American levies on Chinese goods. But how much higher can stocks go on this basis, when a grand bargain covering thornier issues such as intellectual property remains unlikely? “It’s going to be a can that’s going to be kicked further down the line and an avoidance of short-term escalation, which will probably lead to a sigh of relief in the markets, but it won’t go away,” says Dirk Thiels, head of investment management at KBC Asset Management NV in Brussels.",MS,en,Zero Hedge

Markets frequently change their mind, but even adjusting for that, the shift in ‘conventional wisdom’ in recent months has been nothing short of whiplash. In December, there was widespread agreement among investors that recession risk had risen sharply, that rising inflation pressures would keep central banks tightening policy, and that US-based risks around trade and government funding had risen sharply. Skip forward two months and these fears have been replaced by a different (if familiar) term: Goldilocks. The Goldilocks narrative made repeated appearances from 2010-16, and the current version sounds something like this – inflationary pressures have receded, giving central banks wide latitude to pause almost indefinitely on policy tightening. Global growth is slowing, but not enough to be truly concerning. And US political risks are close to resolution, with growing investor optimism that lasting solutions to funding the US government and US-China trade are now within reach.",MS,en,Zero Hedge

A massive $3 trillion in corporate liabilities is about to show up on balance sheets for the first time ever as a result of a new corporate accounting rule that went into effect on January 1. In 2019, companies are going to be required to record the cost of renting assets used in operations, like office space, equipment, planes and cars, on their balance sheet. Previously, these expenses had been buried in the footnotes of financial statements. Only leases that culminated in a purchase of the asset needed to be accounted for otherwise. ""It's going to affect all companies' leverage. They will have more liabilities on their books than they had previously,"" Sheri Wyatt, a partner at accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, said.

Still, while Morgan Stanley revised its earnings numbers lower, surprisingly, its bull, base, and bear case year end price targets remain unchanged for one simple reason: the bank hiked its PE multiple target as ""the lower rate environment provides support for higher year end target multiples"", i.e., the Fed comes to the rescue again. Which brings up an interesting point: how much of the global, central-bank induced bear market of the past decade has been the result of earnings growth, and how much due to multiple expansion?

To Goldman, a ""self-fulfilling prophecy effect"" was visible in the adverse reaction to Chairman Powell’s comment at his December press conference that runoff was on “automatic pilot.” The market reaction was a sharp contrast with the muted responses shown in the chart below to announcements in 2017 in which Fed officials indicated that runoff would begin earlier than expected, an actual policy change.",MS,en,Zero Hedge

As stocks rebound on a bed of freshly squeezed shorts and expanding central bank balance sheets, earnings expectations have plunged to six month lows… Aggregate results are beating consensus estimates and some areas of the market (like Banks and Semis) are suggesting decelerating/negative growth may be priced, but as Morgan Stanley's Michael Wilson warns: ...we are hesitant to draw a bullish signal on either front though given that a) the bar for ""beats"" has been substantially lowered in the last few weeks and b) those areas of the market seeing the biggest rallies were also those where valuation was at extremes, which is not true of many parts of the market which also happened to be the most favored by investors. As always, given the diverging realities in the chart above, the only solution left for analysts is to create hockey-stick versions of the future - just far enough ahead that its tricky to pin them down and just close enough that commission-takers can spin the narrative of X-years ahead multiples are 'cheap'.",MS,en,Zero Hedge

2019-01-28 09:47:06-05:00,Brace For A Barrage Of Delayed Economic Data,"Now that the government is finally reopened after a more than monthlong closure (even if it will most likely be closed again in 3 weeks), the most tangible effect for markets will be the delayed publication of dozens of economic reports that were not distributed by the government from late December until last Friday. And while we will eventually receive the delayed data, Morgan Stanley notes that it will take some time after the government reopens because of information-gathering backlogs. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and Census Bureau should post updated release schedules once the government reopens, but the data calendar is likely to remain very clunky over the next couple of months as a result. For example, after the 2013 shutdown, there were many occasions where we were getting two months’ worth of data at the same time on the same day. The 2013 shutdown was resolved in October, but the data calendar was impacted all the way through December. This is likely to make the GDP tracking estimates look like a heart monitor for some time.",MS,en,Zero Hedge

From its December high on the first day of the month to its low on the 24th, the S&P 500 fell 16%. That dramatic drop, among the declines in other risky asset prices, prompted the Federal Reserve to assuage investor concerns in the first week of January by invoking the word “patient”. Analysts of Fedspeak knew that meant inaction at the next two FOMC meetings, effectively taking the March rate hike off the table. Since then, the S&P 500 is up about 8% as of Thursday’s close. On that nervous January 4th, when Chair Powell first used the word “patient”, he also said that “if [the FOMC] ever came to the conclusion that any aspect of our normalization plans was somehow interfering with our achievement of our statutory goals, we wouldn’t hesitate to change it, and that would include the balance sheet certainly”.",MS,en,Zero Hedge

Is this the turn for the Permian? Perhaps, but, as OilPrice.com's Nick Cuningham notes , while low oil prices are beginning to slow the growth of U.S. shale , in the years ahead oil and gas drilling could be curtailed by a different problem: a shortage of water. Water is a crucial ingredient in the fracking process, and drillers use copious volumes of it. The problem for the U.S. oil industry is that so much of the output growth expected over the next half-decade or so depends very heavily on the Permian basin, where water is increasingly scarce. Water already accounts for about 15 percent of the cost of a shale well, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley. “In the Permian, total spending on water is expected to double over the next 5 years, to $22B, with E&Ps on avg using 50 barrels (bbls) of water for each lateral foot completed,” the investment bank wrote in a new report. “Assuming 10k lateral feet per well, this implies that the ~5,500 existing Permian well permits will require ~2.75 billion bbls of water to complete.” That’s a lot of water in an area that doesn’t have a lot of it. “Given the sizeable water need, we believe drought and water scarcity present long-term risks to shale economics, particularly in the Permian, a core area of growth in a drought-prone region,” Morgan Stanley warned.",MS,en,Zero Hedge

The ""Member's Exchange"" - or ""MeMex"" as its founders are calling it - will be controlled by nine firms: Morgan Stanley, Fidelity Investments, Citadel Securities, BAML, UBS, Charles Schwab, E-Trade and TD Ameritrade. The name is evocative of the early partnership model whereby exchanges were cooperatively owned by their members - which changed in the 1990s as exchange operators started going public and converted to a ""for profit"" model.",MS,en,Zero Hedge
2019-01-07 11:04:52-05:00,"""The Rolling Bear Market Is Now Complete"": Most Bearish Analyst Turns Bullish... But There's A Catch","It took Wall Street and markets about 12 months to admit that Morgan Stanley's Michael Wilson, who for a long time was the most bearish sellside strategist, was correct with his gloomy S&P forecast at a time when his peers were scrambling to come up with the highest possible, and incorrect, 2018 year end S&P price target. And just as Wall Street was well behind the curve on the way down, it will likely be chasing Wilson - who dubbed the term ""rolling bear market"" to describe market action for much of 2018 - as he sheds his bearish aura and turns at least modestly bullish. In a note released early on Monday, the Morgan Stanley analyst notes that while the rolling bear market narrative has described the past year well ""with virtually every asset class in the world derating significantly"" as shown in the chart below… ... He is now comfortable saying that ""the rolling bear market is now complete at the index and sector level"" however, he still thinks that there is idiosyncratic risk at the stock level for valuations to come down further or earnings to be cut more than what is already priced.",MS,en,Zero Hedge

2019-01-06 22:55:00-05:00,"The Fed, China, And The Markets","Authored by Chetan Ahya, Morgan Stanley global head of economics Amid market volatility and continued downside surprises in global growth, investors are focusing on the Fed and China. Regarding the Fed, the issue is whether and when it could signal potential changes in balance sheet normalisation (as it has on the policy rate path). On China, the question is when growth could stabilise. We think policy-makers will take the actions necessary to manage their countries’ respective growth trajectories. We believe that China’s growth will bottom in 1Q19, while the Fed has begun to signal some flexibility on its balance sheet policy, if there is a material deterioration in the growth outlook. The Fed has altered its policy trajectory on rates, but not yet on the balance sheet. Despite robust trailing consumption growth and strong labour market dynamics, the US economy is unlikely to remain immune to slowing global growth. In addition, the recent tightening in financial conditions has affected capex intentions, and we expect the impact of fiscal stimulus on growth to fade in 2019.",MS,en,Zero Hedge
2019-01-04 20:25:44-05:00,"""A Tectonic Shift In China's Economy Has Largely Gone Unnoticed By Investors""","Back in August 2 we reported of a historic event for China's economy : for the first time in its modern history, China's current account balance for the first half of the year had turned into a deficit. And while the full year amount was likely set to revert back to a modest surplus, it was only a matter of time before one of the most unique features of China's economy - its chronic current account surplus - was gone for good. The back in November, as part of its summary of Top Macro Trades for 2019, UBS wrote that the upcoming loss of China's current account cushion, softening domestic activity, and upcoming tariffs mean that ""for the first time in 25 years, China would have to make a choice between external stability and growth."" Now it is the Wall Street's Journal 's turn to bring attention to this topic, calling it a ""tectonic shift"" in China's economy, which has largely gone unnoticed by investors, and which is ""quietly beginning to upend the global financial system."" A key driver behind China's declining current account is that after having long been the world’s heavyweight saver and a huge buyer of foreign assets like Treasurys, the world's most populous nation is now a big spender, and in early 2018, China got more of its growth from consumption than the U.S., the global king of consumer spending where some 70% of economic growth is due to consumer spending.",MS,en,Zero Hedge

As he has done every January for the last 34 years, Blackstone Vice Chairman and former Morgan Stanley Chief Economist Byron Wien on Thursday released his annual ""10 Surprises"" list for the year ahead (the release was accompanied by a brief appearance on CNBC to review his predictions for 2018, while offering some insight into his thought process for 2019). After putting in an abysmal performance with his projections for 2017, Wien had a somewhat better showing in 2018 , accurately predicting that US growth would improve, the Fed would hike rates four times, the dollar would finally ""come to life"" and North Korea would agree to suspend its nuclear weapons program. He also projected that the S&P 500 would endure a 10% correction before rebounding to 3,000, and that oil prices would top $80 a barrel - and although ""almost"" only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades, we think it's fair to acknowledge that Wien was at least half right. Falling mostly in the realm of geopolitics, Wien's less successful calls included projections that Jeremy Corbyn and his Labour Party would rise to power in the UK, and that Republicans would lose control of both Houses of Congress (though again here he was half right).",MS,en,Zero Hedge
2019-01-03 12:07:42-05:00,Ford Will Stop Reporting Monthly Sales Data After Sales Plunge 9%,"Capping what has been an abysmal year for the global automobile market and starting off what Morgan Stanley predicts to be another coming awful year for the industry, Ford reported that its sales for December were down 9%. Ford's fleet sales and car sales both cratered, falling well into the double digits, or -19.5% and -27.8%, respectively. And it looks as though Tim Cook isn’t the only one not especially excited about giving up on transparency heading into the back end of a decade-long artificial bull market. Taking a page out of General Motors' book, Ford announced that they were no longer going to report monthly sales data and will be moving to reporting sales data on a quarterly basis instead. As a reminder, when General Motors changed its reporting of sales, it hilariously stated that reducing its disclosures would ""give a more accurate view of its business operations"".

2019-01-03 10:35:32-05:00,Morgan Stanley Predicts First Global Auto Sales Volume Drop Since 2009,"Morgan Stanley's auto analyst Adam Jonas - formerly one of the biggest Tesla cheerleaders - predicts that global auto sales will be down 0.3% year over year in 2019 and that many consensus estimates across the industry are far too optimistic. In a note released Thursday morning, Jonas predicts ""lower guidance"" coming out of Detroit automakers at the same time that the global auto market sees its first volume drop since 2009. And despite consensus forecasts predicting revenue and margin growth across the board, Morgan Stanley generally defied the trend, reiterating its cautious view on the US auto sector. Jonas expects global volume in 2019 to fall to 82.1 million units versus 82.4 million units in 2018 . His team also expects higher input costs, combined with rising rates and rising R&D expense, to further pressure 2019 numbers. Aside from the obvious (lack of volume growth), he predicts tariff related costs will still be an overhang for automakers heading into the new year. Morgan Stanley also believes that industry consensus for 2019 earnings is too bullish.",MS,en,Zero Hedge

2018-12-27 14:51:51-05:00,Americans Just Blew $850 Billion On Xmas But Here's Why That's Not A Good Sign,"Authored by Daisy Luther via The Organic Prepper blog, The preliminary numbers are in and it appears that Americans exceeded last year’s shopping frenzy with an even more extravagant one this year. Mastercard says that spending was up 5.1% over last Christmas, which brings us to an astronomical $850 billion spent between November 1st and Christmas Eve. Of these shopping sprees, online sales increased by nearly 20% , which means that we could soon see another wave of brick and mortar closures , just like last year. Amazon pretty much owned Christmas, with a “record-breaking” holiday season , reporting one billion items delivered for free. Three times as many purchases this year were handled by Alexa , too, which means buyers didn’t even have to type in a credit card number. “Alexa, find me a bankruptcy attorney.” So, even though Americans blew through $850 billion dollars at Christmas, this may not actually mean that the economy is on the upswing. All the problems there before the holiday didn’t just go away.",MS,en,Zero Hedge
