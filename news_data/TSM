Rumour has it that the stock markets have been driven in one direction by the irrational exuberance of the Robin Hood crowd, but don’t believe a word of it, that’s only a fraction of the truth. Having recently received some marketing emails from a recent start-up that is applying the techniques of gamification to drive interest in their investment products I was struck by the extent to which this firm clearly believed ‘Generation XYZ’ wouldn’t pay attention unless the message came complete with amusing icons and bright shiny colours. Increasingly it looks like the future of retail investing might be best described as where Batman meets Warren Buffet.","TSM,TSLA",en,ETF Express

Due to US sanctions , however, the foundries operated by Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) were only able to accept Huawei's orders until May 15, and can only produce chips until September 15. No foundries besides Samsung and TSMC currently offer the 7nm manufacturing capabilities needed to produce the most advanced smartphone chipsets.

Perhaps the biggest challenge for Apple will be decarbonizing its immense supply chain, particularly the manufacturers of its products. Roughly half of the total emissions that Apple takes the blame for come from the electricity used to make its iPhones, iPads, Macs and other products. That creates an enormous opportunity for renewable energy. Since 2018, Apple has powered its own facilities and operations entirely with renewables. Typically, Apple signs contracts (including virtual power purchase agreements) with renewables developers like Avangrid and sPower, although it occasionally buys projects outright or makes equity investments.",TSM,en,Green Technology Media

It's still unclear, however, if the iPhone 12 will be released in 2020. Visit BGR’s homepage for more stories . Even though we're barely a month removed from Samsung introducing its next-gen Galaxy S20 smartphone lineup, we're already starting to see a lot of rumors for the Galaxy Note 20+ starting to make their way down the pipeline.

In addressing the prospect of additional US restrictions — believed to involve barring Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co from supplying chips to Huawei — Xu suggested China's government would take countermeasures. Huawei's plan to address setbacks in 2020 could see the telecommunications giant emerge with several long-term advantages over competitors.

The iPhone 12 release may be delayed for a few months due to the economic impact of the coronavirus. Apple will reportedly nail down an iPhone 12 release date sometime in May. Visit BGR’s homepage for more stories . A new report from Digitimes ( via MacRumors ) relays that TSMC's plan to begin manufacturing 5nm chips is still on schedule.

Recall, the iPhone 12 will boast an A14 chip that will reportedly be based on a 5nm process. The benefit of the new 5nm process would manifest in significant performance gains while using markedly less power. Put simply, Apple's A14 chip will likely represent a huge step up in overall efficiency. Of course, it remains unclear just when the iPhone 12 will actually hit store shelves.

2020-01-03 05:34:04-05:00,TSMC to start production of A14 chip for 2020 iPhones: Report,"San Francisco: Apple chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has secured orders for the ""A14"" processors and it is expected to start manufacturing the chips in the second quarter of this year. The chips will likely be used in the next generation of Apple's iPhones, including the iPhone 12 and the rumoured ""iPhone SE 2"". The new A14 chip will be manufactured using TSMC's new 5 nanometer production process, down from 7 nanometer fabrication. Chips using the 5-nanometer EUV process stand to offer a 1.8-times logic density improvement and 15-percent speed gain on ARM Cortex-A72 cores over the 7-nanometer process, reports AppleInsider. Noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has recently claime that Apple may launch four 5G-enabled iPhones next year and while 5G-related components could raise the production costs of the devices, he believes that the iPhone maker will not significantly increase the price of 5G iPhones. 5G components are projected to raise the production cost of the new iPhones by anywhere from $30 to $100.",TSM,en,Sify.com
2020-01-02 15:11:52-05:00,"Ahead of iPhone 12 release, TSMC to begin A14 chip production in Q2","As Apple continues to improve chip performance with each passing year, and arguably leaving competitors in the dust, we're just a few months away from Apple rolling out its next-gen iPhone with a brand new A14 chip. In light of that, a new report from Digitimes relays that Apple has once again tapped TSMC to be the sole supplier of its next-gen mobile chips. The report adds that TSMC will begin A14 production sometime during the second quarter of the year. What's more, the report notes that the A14 chips will be manufactured with a 5nm process, making it the first A-x series chip to have that distinction. As a point of reference, Apple's A12 and A13 chips were manufactured with a 7nm process. ""As much as two thirds of TSMC's available 5nm process capacity will be utilized to make the next-generation iPhone chips,"" the report claims. As to what the 5nm process means in terms of real-world usage, it points to the iPhone 12 offering up improved performance while also being more power-efficient than its predecessor.",TSM,en,BGR.com
2020-01-02 07:55:04-05:00,TSMC Expected to Begin 'A14' 5nm Chip Production in Second Quarter,"As expected, Apple chipmaker TSMC has secured orders for the ""A14"" processors to go in this year's iPhones and is expected to start manufacturing the chips in the second quarter, according to industry sources cited in a DigiTimes report. The sources said Apple's 5G mmWave handsets to be released in 2020 are reportedly to each carry at least three AiP modules, which can also be packaged with FC_AiP (flip-chip) process in addition to InFo_AiP. TSMC has been working hard to miniaturize its fabrication process to 5 nanometers – down from 7 nanometer fabrication seen in the A12 and A13 – with the aim of securing orders for Apple's processors in its iPhones for the fourth year running. Previous successes in miniaturization have enabled the foundry to be Apple's exclusive supplier of A-series chips, beginning with the A10 Fusion chip in the iPhone 7/7 Plus, and continuing with the A11 Bionic chip in the iPhone 8 /8 Plus and ‌‌iPhone‌‌ X, the A12 Bionic in the iPhone XR /XS/XS Max, and the A13 Bionic in the iPhone 11 series.",TSM,en,Mac Rumors

To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here. This past weekend Epic Games hosted the first-ever Fortnite World Cup Finals in NYC, which I attended, and will write up in greater detail later this week. Fortnite has taken the world by storm, garnering 250 million players worldwide in under two years, and quickly cementing itself — especially after this tournament — as a top tier game in esports. In part, Fortnite is so successful because of its highly engaging nature, which includes almost weekly updates and rollouts of new features, requiring a high level of commitment for players to stay on top of their game. Those updates include many in-game purchases, which have allowed Epic to monetize the game: The developer made $1.2 billion off of Fortnite in 2018 alone, making it the first free game to pull in a billion in its first year. As a result of its massive player and fanbase, Fortnite World Cup attracted attention and dollars on par with traditional sports events: Epic doled out $100 million in prize money over the course of the qualifiers and finals, a move many fans considered a representation of the firm giving back to its fervent community.",TSM,en,Business Insider
