So far, India uses petrol, diesel, CNG and auto-LPG as fuels to run automobiles. LNG is a new fuel that can be dispensed from outlets similar to petrol pumps, and is used not just in long long-haul buses and trucks but also in running mining equipment, as bunker fuel, and rail locomotives.

The TCS board is considering a buyback. For shareholders, what is the right way of looking at it because at close to the current price, the company is considering a buyback when the stock price is at an all-time high. Historically buyback is considered to be a vote of confidence but is this more of a compulsion because of Tata Sons?Dividends have been substituted by buybacks in the recent past because till last year, the dividend distribution tax was very high tax ratio compared to payouts if people did it in the format of dividend versus a buyback. This year, while dividend tax has been introduced it is still a little more beneficial for promoters to do a buyback and so the price is irrelevant because whatever amount they would have otherwise be distributed as dividend.",TTM,en,Economic Times India

""The auto demand continues to face several challenges and Fitch forecasts overall industry volume to decline by more than 20 per cent in the financial year to June 2021. This forecast could be revised down if the extent and magnitude of the pandemic are worse than we expect. ""The economic fallout from pandemic exacerbated the weak consumer sentiment that was dampened by the higher cost of ownership under BS6 -- a more stringent emission framework adopted from April. This is likely to constrain demand from first-time car buyers as well as upgraders despite their preference for private transportation due to hygiene reasons. Likely curtailment in private and public investments will weigh on demand for commercial vehicles (CVs), particularly medium and heavy commercial vehicles (MHCV), which are used in more cyclical end-markets.",TTM,en,Sify.com

What is your assessment of the way the markets have climbed the wall of worry?Markets have moved up very very fast. 4,000 points for Bank Nifty in the last seven trading sessions is a huge move. Two things have happened here. One, the opening up of the economy is something which is providing hope for the markets and two, there has been a lot of short covering; so the market was pretty light and there were a lot of shorts in the markets after the extension of bank moratorium. So these are the factors. Apart from that, there is an expectation that there is going to be pent-up demand and we are likely to see an immediate bump up coming in the next couple of months. So these are some of the factors which have helped and of course led to the huge rally that we have seen. But having said that, I believe from here on, the markets are likely to be range bound because most of the stocks which have rallied, apart from banking sector where the valuations have moved up, there is very limited room in terms of rerating left and from here on, it will depend on how the operating performance starts panning out.I want to talk in particular about the Tata Group of companies.",TTM,en,Economic Times India

However, larger dealers especially those associated with multi brands, are launching their own direct dealer digital models.“Dealers with associated businesses and multi brands would like to control the lifecycle of the customer relationship,” said Som Kapoor, partner at EY. “They will try and move from CRM, which is primarily a pre-sales tool to a 'customer life time value' model, and to do this, they would like to build a 'single view of the customer' model and try and monetise that over the lifetime of a customer relationship,” adds Kapoor.Multi-brand dealerships want to create specific data and use it to do cross sales, integrate the process to finally sell a car, thus reducing their dependence on auto majors.“The OEM wants to own social media, website, do recruitments, propose incentive schemes, control increments and own customer data,” said Kunal Gambhir of DD Motors, a multi brand dealer from Delhi.New entrant Kia Motors said it had set in place its online initiatives at the time of the launch itself. ""We have linked our online platform with our dealers, ideally both should be linked,” said Manohar Bhatt, head, sales and marketing, Kia Motors, adding that the matter of controlling customer data is very delicate.Dealers say manufacturers launched the online digital models to take control of the customers’ mind share seeing the current situation of restrictions in movement and social distancing.""OEMs are not confident that all the dealers are capable enough to manage on their own.",TTM,en,Economic Times India

While other companies are yet to make announcements, most industry executives ET spoke to want to continue with the current practice while some supported quarterly reporting. There is also a debate over whether to report wholesale numbers or retail, or both. One thing almost everyone agrees on is a single system for a correct market picture. The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) has yet to take a stand. India’s largest passenger vehicle maker, Maruti Suzuki, told ET it would follow SIAM’s mandate and release monthly data. Hyundai Motors India sales and marketing director Tarun Garg said Hyundai would also follow SIAM’s guidelines, and that it was fine with reporting wholesale or retail numbers.The industry body, when contacted, said it was in dialogue with Tata Motors over sales reporting and would sort out the issue in two to three weeks.",TTM,en,Economic Times India

As a result, a bailout by the UK government seems to be the only chance of survival for these businesses, officials close to the development said. However, the UK government is unlikely to offer more than one fifth of the funds required by these businesses, a person with direct knowledge of the development said.With the UK government keen to support locally-owned businesses first, fund infusion from Tata Sons was expected to be a fallback option for Tata steel’s European businesses. But support from the Indian parent now seems unlikely.The UK arm of Tata Steel has reportedly sought an estimated £500 million ( ₹4,750 crore) from the British government to survive the coronavirus lockdown period, according to UK media reports.Tata Sons has to assign funds to meet several other financial commitments and Tata Steel will essentially have to fend for itself, officials said.75440478Focus on Preserving Cash: Tata SteelTraditionally the holding company has always been seen as a financial backstop for its operating companies.But Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran had warned early this year that the Indian entity cannot keep funding losses.Tata Sons plans to keep a war chest ready of over $5 billion (₹38,000 crore), as per the sources cited.",TTM,en,Economic Times India

It is finding more takers in the auto-parts business now, with risk mitigation emerging as the cornerstone of the industry’s supply chain strategy in the post-Covid-19 landscape. And the prime beneficiary of that approach could be local sourcing.Companies such as Tata Motors and Maruti are keen to increase local sourcing, while some others still see value in buying from China, given the cost competitiveness.To be sure, China isn’t firing on all cylinders now. With BS6 emission norms effective this April, the supply sources must diversify.While India would be still dependent on imports for battery, electronics or a rare-earth magnet for electric motors, other components such as castings, axles and wheel rings can be locally produced here, say ancillary makers.“Clearly, the ancillary industry does need handholding from OEMs, which is not going to be an easy task. If the components are made locally, they have to be tested, validated and it is a long drawn game,” said Vinnie Mehta, Director at ACMA (Automotive Component Manufacturers Association).“For certain parts, if the price difference is hardly 5-7%, it does not make it that cost competitive to import and companies will look to source locally,” said Hemant Sikka, the erstwhile head of sourcing, and currently president of the tractor division at Mahindra.",TTM,en,Economic Times India

Automakers are planning 15-20 new electric vehicles for launch in the next three years, with nearly a dozen of those in the affordable segment costing less than Rs 10 lakh.This massive vehicle electrification drive is being led by Indian vehicle makers — Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra — who will be launching half of these models with an eye on addressing the local market needs in terms of range and affordability.Suzuki-Toyota, Hyundai Motor and MG Motor too have scaled up research and development programmes to develop India-specific products, which could also be exported to other emerging markets at a later stage.Close to a couple of billion dollars are likely to be spent on electric vehicles meant for India. However, the homegrown vehicle makers are adopting a frugal approach.Tata Motors will be using its modular petrol or diesel-run vehicle architecture to come out with electric variants.

In fact, in the past four years, safety has become one of the top-five considerations that a customer makes while buying a new car according to a new car buyer survey that automakers refer to, an industry insider said.Attaining high safety ratings from the Global New Car Assessment Programme (G-NCAP) has now become a marketing pitch for companies like Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra.NCAP, an initiative by UK-based charity Towards Zero Foundation, has crash-tested 37 models in India since 2014 and rated them for safety on a 5-star scale. Given that all the top-selling vehicles in India are in the affordable range, where manufacturers often tried to be frugal, it came as no surprise that most of those failed the test.The lack of consumer interest in safety is due to the absence of awareness, NCAP president David Ward said, pointing to the fact that in the past five years, with rising consumer awareness, demand for safety features had gone up.Market penetration of key safety features like electronic traction control, brake assist system and attachment points for child safety seats has increased multi-fold over the past five years, data shared by Jato Dynamics showed.",TTM,en,The Economic Times India

The second law of thermodynamics says orderly things gradually turn more chaotic, and there’s no going back, no separating yokes from whites.But the appeals judge of India’s corporate law arbiter thinks he can reverse time. Or so it would appear from his order declaring that Cyrus Mistry, deposed three years ago as executive chairman of the holding company of India’s leading conglomerate, must be reinstated because ousting him was illegal.Here’s the messy business in a nutshell: The closely held Tata Sons, which sits in control of the $111 billion global empire spread across more than 100 firms, is 66% owned by Tata Trusts, charities run by Ratan Tata, the group patriarch. Mistry’s family owns an 18%-plus stake in Tata Sons. That equity has its origin in an unpaid $200 million loan the Tata family took in 1925 to save its then-fledgling steel business. The core dispute is whether the holding company is a quasi-partnership between the Tata Group and the 154-year-old Shapoorji Pallonji, or SP, Group, which is now run by Shapoor Mistry, the elder brother of Cyrus. 72881519 If it’s a partnership, then Mistry gets to argue that his minority rights were suppressed.",TTM,en,The Economic Times India

The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) termed Mistry’s removal in October 2016 by Tata Sons as illegal and made him executive chairman again, queering the pitch for the sprawling salt-software conglomerate headed by the soft-spoken N Chandrasekharan who replaced him. The NCLAT also set aside Tata Sons’ decision to convert itself into a private company and accepted Mistry’s argument that Tata Sons and its directors and shareholders acted in a prejudicial and oppressive manner to minority shareholders. Tata group shares fell after the ruling with Tata Motors -- the company with the biggest debt -- falling nearly 3% while Tata Global Beverages fell 4% and Indian Hotels slipped 3%.

The customs department seems to think so, going by its latest tax demand from carmakers.The customs department has started issuing notices to several automakers, asking them to cough up 28% goods and services tax on imported plastic goods such as ashtrays and floormats instead of 18% GST, people familiar with the development said.The logic? While plastic goods attract only 18% GST, here they are used as auto components that attract 28% GST. Top automakers such as Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors have already been questioned by the customs department in last couple of weeks, the sources said. Several other companies could get these notices in the coming weeks, they said.Industry trackers said this is a classification issue under GST regulations. “The industry has been adopting the classification (of plastic goods and other imports used in cars) for over a decade, which has been accepted by the customs authorities in the past,” said Rohit Jain, partner at Mumbai-based law firm ELP.“The classification is required to be done on a case by case basis as per the scheme of the Customs Tariff Act.”He said the tax demand will impact the sector that’s going through one of its worst crises.70811206 The auto industry recorded its worst sales slump in nearly 19 years in July.",TTM,en,The Economic Times India

What does one do at a time like this?Given the slowdown that we are witnessing in the domestic economy and the quarterly earnings season, it is not likely to throw up many surprises. In that kind of a backdrop, it would be hard to imagine that we are going to have some strength in the market.

Automakers, however, expect sales to perk up once election results are announced in late-May.“A lot of regulations related to safety and emission norms will come in over the next few months,” said Maruti chairman R C Bhargava.68680100 “There is a possibility that customers may choose to buy vehicles before prices go up…I personally feel this year (2019-20) will be much better than the last one,” he said, adding the industry may start to recover much before the second half of the fiscal year. Maruti Suzuki’s domestic sales declined marginally to 147,613 units last month, as sales of entry level cars such as the Alto and Wagon R dropped about 55%.",TTM,en,The Economic Times India

Incentives and reductions totaling more than 10% of the sticker price are now common, while interest free loans are also being offered to try and lure car buyers to showrooms, especially outside of China’s major cities. For now, however, buyers still aren’t taking the bait and car sales continue to decline this year in China, after their first annual drop in more than two decades. Making matters worse, amid the slowdown of the world's second largest economy consumers are starting to do away with big purchases in general. There’s also an argument surfacing that heavy incentivizing could wind up doing more harm than good to automakers' finances, possibly setting up for more layoffs, restructurings and mergers in the industry.",TTM,en,Zero Hedge
