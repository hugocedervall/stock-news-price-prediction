2019-02-12 13:29:59-05:00,"In Unprecedented Move, Santander Declines To Redeem $1.7 Billion CoCo Bond Issue","Banco Santander SA has earned its ""special place in markets hell"" - as Bloomberg columnist Marcus Ashworth termed it. Shares of Santander erased and earlier gain and closed lower on Tuesday after the bank confirmed anxious bondholders fears by affirming that it would refuse to exercise a call option on a €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion) issue of Additional Tier 1s - better known as contingent convertible, or CoCo - bonds. Santander's decision makes it the first European bank in the still-young $340 billion market for bank AT1 notes to decline to call the bonds after the standard five-year term. A spokesman for the bank told BBG that it wouldn't redeem the bonds out of an “obligation to assess the economics and balance the interests of all investors."" The price of the bonds, which are one of the riskiest tranches of debt that can be issued by a European bank, also slid: Now that the bank has declined to redeem the bonds, defying accepted practice for what is still a relatively new asset class, holders of the euro-denominated bond will lose their 6.25% coupon, and the coupon will switch to the five-year swap rate, plus 541 basis points, which, at the prevailing rate, is about 5.55%, according to BBG .","BSBR,BSAC",en,Zero Hedge
