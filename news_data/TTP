The Democratic presidential candidates have doubled down on the party’s opposition to the Trump immigration policies while supporting sanctuary cities, noncooperation with ICE on detainers and other issues.

There was considerable coverage of the travel ban litigation when lower courts were ruling against the Administration. The litigation was no doubt prolonged by an original order that was poorly written and poorly defended.",TTP,en,Zero Hedge
