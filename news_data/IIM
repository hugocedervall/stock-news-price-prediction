2019-11-18 12:45:17-05:00,View: Don't jump the gun in Infosys governance row,"By Rishikesha T KrishnanThe first time I heard of Infosys was about 30 years ago. I was working in my father’s company at that time, and I attended a meeting organised by the Electronics and Computer Software Export Promotion Council at Bangalore to promote software exports. One of the key speakers was a bespectacled man with a professorial air who was relatively unknown at that time, but who would, in the course of time, become one of the icons of Indian business: N R Narayana Murthy.He spoke with a passionate air, was clearly enthused by what he saw as the prospects for India in an emerging industry, but was equally forthright about the policy constraints that at the time held back companies from achieving their full potential.Over the years, Infosys would become symbolic of a new India, earning its reputation and heft through the quality of the services it offered, rather than the wealth and privilege inherited by its owners. It prided itself on the quality of its disclosures and the standards it set for corporate governance.",IIM,en,The Economic Times India
