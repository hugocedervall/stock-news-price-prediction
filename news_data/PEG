2020-09-16 07:00:00-05:00,The 5 Biggest US Utilities Committing to Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050,"Over the past three years, some of the country’s biggest utilities have been committing to a goal that few may have predicted they’d undertake on their own: weaning themselves off carbon-emitting generation by 2050. Driving this sea change in long-term planning is a combination of public pressure and energy economics. The falling costs of wind and solar power are pushing utilities to find ways to incorporate them into their long-range plans, even as they struggle to define what resources can be relied on to provide the dispatchable power they need. At the same time, the increasingly dire effects of global warming are bringing more Americans in line with much of the rest of the world in making carbon-emissions reduction a top policy priority. Utilities in many states now face mandates to move to 100 percent renewable energy or cut carbon to zero by 2050. Others are likely to face similar mandates in short order. If Joe Biden wins the presidential election in November and Congress enacts his $2 trillion clean energy and infrastructure ambition, utilities will need to reconfigure their plans to meet Biden's nationwide goal of zero-carbon electricity by 2035.",PEG,en,Green Technology Media
