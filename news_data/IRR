Ravaged by crippling hyperinflation, Iran’s Parliament has sanctioned the redenomination of its fiat — the rial — by replacing it with a new currency called the toman. According to the plan, each toman will be worth 10,000 rials. The redenomination plan effectively removes four place values (four zeros) from the Iranian national currency as part of efforts to kickstart an economic recovery from the country. It is a move that echoes steps taken by other countries like Venezuela and Zimbabwe amid huge inflation. With the United States exiting its nuclear deal with Iran and reintroducing sanctions, the country’s economic situation has been in a tailspin. Virtually frozen from the international scene, Iran has been facing a severe liquidity crunch and foreign exchange shortage.

2020-01-14 16:30:00-05:00,Crypto Community Eyes US–Iran Crisis As Tensions Flare,"A different view of cryptocurrencies post-crisis? ‘‘It was quite profound to see Bitcoin acting as a clear safe haven.” For one week, the Iran –United States military crisis gripped the crypto community. It began on Jan. 3 with a U.S. drone strike on a convoy traveling near Baghdad International Airport, killing Iranian major general Qasem Soleimani of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The price of Bitcoin ( BTC ) soared. As reported by Cointelegraph at the time, there is strong evidence to suggest that BTC’s price surge from $7,000 to nearly $8,500 is strongly linked to the tensions between the two nations. For example, the push toward $8,500 took place at the same time as mainstream media began to report on a retaliatory attack by Iran on the American forces based in Iraq. According to data from Google Trends, the search term “Bitcoin Iran” surged 4,450% in the seven days to Jan. 8, Cointelegraph disclosed . The crisis spurred a surge in cryptocurrencies, the Nikkei Asian Review proclaimed , as “migrant workers and investors turn to ‘digital gold ’ as financial conduit and safe haven.” Nigel Green, CEO of the United Kingdom’s deVere Group, said on the matter: “This latest Bitcoin price increase underscores a mounting consensus that Bitcoin is becoming a flight-to-safety asset.” Related: Bitcoin Is Becoming More Valuable to Iranians Amid Tensions With US After U.S.",IRR,en,Cointelegraph
