He's not taking it apart the traditional way either. Utilizing a roll-up strategy unmatched in freight industry annals for speed, scale, and no shortage of doubters, Jacobs, the founder, chairman and CEO, took XPO in less than nine years from a $150 million domestic company with one or two revenue lines to a $17 billion international behemoth with conglomerate-like features. Now, in one fell swoop, about $13 billion of that revenue has been put on the block. Four units — each one large enough to be substantial stand-alone businesses — may be sold or spun off. The units will be offered concurrently. The time frame for full disposition is considered ambitious — perhaps as soon as six months, according to people familiar with the process. Each unit will be offered as a whole entity. This means prospective buyers can't cherry-pick the lines they want. For example, XPO's North American Transportation unit, one of the four for sale, houses the brokerage, final-mile, managed transportation and intermodal businesses.",XPO,en,Benzinga Feeds

2020-01-17 09:07:42-05:00,The Big Pivot: XPO Logistics' Next Decade Won't Look Like Its First,"Just nine years ago, XPO Logistics Inc . (NYSE: XPO ) was a $150 million-a-year expeditor whose new owner, Brad Jacobs, had designs to dominate the freight brokerage sector. Yet as Jacobs became comfortable with the freight industry, he realized his ambitions were too modest. So XPO expanded into contract logistics, last mile, intermodal, Europe and, finally less-than-truckload (LTL). By the end of the decade, XPO was a $17 billion, multi-modal giant whose main value proposition lay in cross-selling its many capabilities to big customers. Now Jacobs and XPO have pivoted again. By exploring the sale of the entire company save its North American LTL business, Jacobs, the board and management have signaled that XPO's days of being what amounted to a transport and logistics conglomerate are over. Its future, which Jacobs plans to guide no matter how it plays out, lies exclusively with a $42 billion LTL industry that itself may operate quite differently two to three years from now. XPO cautioned that there is no timetable to accomplish any asset sales or spinoffs, and that no deals may ever be consummated.",XPO,en,Benzinga Feeds

The most important thing for retailers going into the holiday season is knowing which products are in high demand,"" said Mario Harik, Chief Information Officer at XPO Logistics. Be flexible in positioning and operations around customer plans – 3PLs may have to reconfigure pick and pack lines around hot holiday items. That can mean pre-filling boxes with certain items expected to be big sellers or putting more workers on a particular stock keeping unit. Make sure that warehouse execution systems integrate with customer software – 3PLs need to receive ordering information on a continuous, real-time basis (even on weekends) throughout the holiday period to ensure timely delivery and maximum utilization of assets.",XPO,en,Benzinga Feeds

Last week the California Trucking Association (CTA) filed a legal challenge against the bill, AB5, saying it will result in 70,000 drivers in the state losing their ability to work and that the state-level legislation defies federal law. A Teamsters executive fired back with a statement citing exploitative working conditions at the San Pedro ports, where around 12,000 rail and port drivers haul containers short distances to warehouses and rail yards. ""For decades, companies like Lowe's, Rio Tinto Mines and Target have enjoyed unprecedented profitability and shareholder value off the backs of the hardworking truck drivers who haul their imported cargo from our nation's seaports to their warehouses,"" said Fred Potter, vice president-at-large, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and director of the Teamsters' Port Division , in the statement, released last week. ""It's no surprise that their trucking contractors are going to court to perpetuate a scheme — deemed illegal by multiple regulatory agencies and courts long before Assembly Bill 5 was introduced in the California Legislature — that has robbed the typical driver of tens of thousands of dollars a year due to their misclassification as independent contractors.""

Central Freight Lines first began hauling less-than-truckload (LTL) freight for Amazon in 2011. But Central Freight said the relationship with Amazon started going south by 2016 as it ""attempted to wield its economic power to force through billing and procedure changes that Central Freight never agreed to"" the carrier's complaint said.
