A medida também contempla o aumento por mudança de faixa etária, entre setembro e dezembro. A recomposição das possíveis perdas da não aplicação do reajuste nos planos coletivos será feita futuramente, provavelmente, em 2021. Já os planos individuais não devem ter essa recomposição, segundo fontes. As operadoras são favoráveis à medida da ANS, pois querem evitar que o tema vá para o Congresso e seja votado um projeto de lei, do senador Eduardo Braga (MDB-AM), que suspende o reajuste por quatro meses devido à pandemia — como ameaçou, ontem, o presidente da Câmara.

2019-09-25 00:38:11-05:00,SpiceJet eyes 100 Airbus planes worth $13 bn,"By Richard Clough and Anurag KotokyIndia’s SpiceJet is weighing an order for at least 100 Airbus SE planes as Boeing Co. grapples with the fallout over its grounded 737 Max.The budget carrier, a major global customer for the Max, may buy a “sizable” number of Airbus A321LR and XLR jets to accommodate a planned expansion, SpiceJet Chairman Ajay Singh said Tuesday. No decision has been made, he said, and the airline would consider a competing midrange jetliner if Boeing decides to build one.Airbus has “pushed us hard since the day we started flying Boeing aircraft, and of course with the current problems, they’ve pushed us harder,” Singh said in an interview at Bloomberg’s headquarters in New York. “They have made us a commercial offer and we are evaluating it.”The discussions with Airbus threaten Boeing with a high-profile defection at a time when the U.S. planemaker is enmeshed in one of the biggest crises in its 103-year history. SpiceJet, India’s second-largest airline, has 13 Max jets already in its fleet and has committed to buy as many as 205 of the single-aisle workhorses as it expands capacity to handle the nation’s fast-growing demand for air travel.While Singh didn’t specify the exact size of a potential transaction, he said “any aircraft order that SpiceJet places would at least be 100 aircraft.” That would value the deal in excess of $13 billion, based on 2018 list prices before customary discounts for the A321neo.",BBD,en,The Economic Times India
2019-08-28 13:24:20-05:00,"Believe it or not, here's an industry that wants to pay more GST","NEW DELHI: Amid the clamour for cuts in goods and services tax (GST) rates to help revive demand, rail manufacturers are seeking the opposite—an increase. Alstom, General Electric and Bombardier, which have set up manufacturing facilities in the country for rail wagons, have written to the government, seeking a 12% GST levy on rail products from 5% now.Inputs are levied GST of 5% and 18%, leading to an inverted duty structure as hundreds of crores of rupees in input tax credit are stuck, the companies say. This gives imported rail products an advantage as they just have to pay the 5% levy, frustrating the government’s aim to boost local manufacture.“The restriction on refund of unutilised input GST credit on account of inverted duty structure has increased costs of the railway products manufacturing industry and gives a competitive disadvantage to domestic products vis-à-vis imported products, thereby adversely impacts Make in India initiative,” said Alstom India chief financial officer Simon Garnier.Refunds of unutilised input tax credit on certain notified goods including railway products has been restricted.",BBD,en,The Economic Times India

The plane, which began life as the Bombardier C Series, is designed to fill the market gap between mid-size regional jets and workhorse narrow-body jets like the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. It can also be used to replace larger regional jets. Recently, I flew the A220 for the first time on a short flight from Boston's Logan Airport to New York LaGuardia, in the first-class cabin. I was impressed by just about every aspect of the plane, and found it a pleasant upgrade over the regional jets that usually operate that flight. Read on to learn more about what flying on the jet is like. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. The Airbus A220 was one of the most controversial and highly anticipated new planes to launch in recent memory. The 100-seat jet was originally designed by Canadian plane-and-train maker Bombardier, sold as the C Series jet, and in 2016 Delta placed an order for a number of C Series planes to replace some of its aging regional jets.",BBD,en,Business Insider
