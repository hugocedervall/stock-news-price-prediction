2020-10-15 21:09:03-05:00,Federal judge accuses Trump administration lawyers of 'straight up dishonesty' in case over COVID-19 outbreak among detained immigrants,"Summary List Placement A US federal court harshly rebuked Trump administration lawyers on Thursday, accusing them of ""straight up dishonesty"" in a blistering opinion that orders the US government to release — or deport — hundreds of detained immigrants to stop the spread of the coronavirus. The ruling concerns the Adelanto Immigration and Customs Enforcement Processing Center in Southern California, run by the private prison company GEO Group, where at least 162 detained immigrants have tested positive for COVID-19. That's more than 20 percent of the facility's current population, making it the worst outbreak at any ICE detention center. Saying it had ""been concerned for some time with the lack of candor exhibited by the government,"" the US District Court for the Central District of California issued an Oct. 15 order requiring ICE to reduce the Adelanto population by 50 people a day, starting next week, until it is reduced from 772 detainees to 475. In its order, the court said it is rare that a judge will be ""presented with direct evidence of dishonesty."" In this case, however, ""the government provided the court with a blaring example"" of it.",GEO,en,Business Insider
