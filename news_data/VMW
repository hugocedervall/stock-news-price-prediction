Starting in February, the first outbreaks of the coronavirus pandemic resulted in China shutting down, followed by other countries from March onward. Companies had to quickly pivot to enabling remote work where possible and crafting new work-from-home (WFH) policies, many of which will remain in effect into 2021 and beyond. Hackers have rapidly moved to target remote workers and adjusted their tactics to take advantage of the move to WFH. IT departments are reacting to the rapid move to WFH by adding network, virtual private networks (VPNs), and firewall capacity to keep up with user demand—but the road has been bumpy. These technologies have been around for years, and will still be in use for years to come, but they have many shortcomings in terms of cost and performance that will require the use of newer, cloud-based technologies.",VMW,en,Business Insider

Users of virtualization software have reported that macOS 10.15.6 crashes repeatedly when running virtual machines. A regression in the App Sandbox component of macOS 10.15.6 is reportedly leaking kernel memory, causing macOS to crash. The purpose of an App Sandbox is to provide protection to system resources and limit an app's access to resources, such as memory. VMware engineers have today diagnosed the issue and filed a ""comprehensive"" report with Apple, including a minimal reproduction case which should allow them to easily identify and address the issue. The engineer cautions that ""it isn't looking good"" going forwards, and it will likely fall to Apple to resolve the issue in a software update to macOS. It is unclear if this issue exists in developer and public betas of macOS Big Sur. The workaround suggested by many users and VMware engineers is to refrain from installing macOS 10.15.6, or shutting down virtual machines when they are not in use and rebooting the host as often as possible.",VMW,en,Mac Rumors

When Evernote recruited CEO Ian Small in late 2018, he realized that the company needed to completely rebuild its apps. Not only were they filled with bugs, but their tech core was a decade old, which slowed down new releases. Rebuilding the product also involved a cultural change of more collaboration and transparency within the company itself. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . The story of note-taking app Evernote has both high-highs and low-lows: It was one of the first ""unicorn"" startups with a billion-dollar valuation and a cult-like following in 2012, before plunging into ""deep trouble"" in 2015 and a ""death spiral"" that included executive departures in fall 2018. By October of that year, the company recruited current CEO Ian Small who has led Evernote's slow, laborious resurrection ever since, including the decision to completely rebuild its app. ""If you work anywhere in Silicon Valley, they say, 'Let's go back to basics,"" Small told Business Insider. ""The reason people say it is because frequently products lose their 'why.'"" That's exactly what happened to Evernote, he admits, which is why the team has spent the last year and a half chugging away on the on-going process of competely redesigning its product to try to win back its once-fervent following. ""At the end of the day, you have to focus on who your users are and what brought them close to the products in the first place,"" Small said.",VMW,en,Business Insider

If you aren’t operating at your best, your chances of success are severely diminished. And this even extends to the IT department, which is why so many companies around the world use VMWare’s vSphere virtualization platform. vSphere optimizes your existing computer infrastructure. It’s a gross oversimplification, but it essentially allows you to run a large number of virtual machines using just one physical system. The end result is that you’ll end up paying less for equipment, use what you already have more efficiently, and significantly reduce or even eliminate downtime. But, even simplified, that sounds pretty complicated. Need a crash course in how it works but would rather avoid expensive and time consuming classroom sessions?
