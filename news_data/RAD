One place where you'll be able to get the COVID-19 vaccine for free is at any location of the Rite Aid drugstore chain. Rite Aid has sent out a letter to customers saying it will provide COVID-19 vaccine shots at no cost. Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children's Hospital, said in an interview this week with NPR that after certain populations started to get vaccinated for COVID-19 in December, a broader vaccination program will follow quickly once 2021 gets underway. Indeed, the expectation is that a ""significant percentage"" of the US population will be able to receive the coronavirus vaccine early next year -- which the doctor says is the reason why he's asked one question pretty regularly. It's ""'Hey, doc, which vaccine are you waiting for?'

Jeff Merkley and Bernie Sanders on Tuesday would curb the use of facial recognition software by corporations and help to slow the spread of ""abusive"" surveillance, according to leading privacy advocates. Similar to Illinois' Biometric Information Privacy Act, which has been in place since 2008, the Merkley-Sanders legislation would bar corporations from using facial recognition without the knowledge and explicit affirmative consent of customers .

We cannot allow Orwellian facial recognition technology to continue to violate the privacy and civil liberties of the American people ,"" Sanders told Business Insider Tuesday. The Illinois law has resulted in $650 million in fines for Facebook over its use of facial recognition-enabled tagging in the state, and was cited by the ACLU in May when the group sued Clearview AI over its collection and storing of the data of residents without their knowledge of consent.",RAD,en,Zero Hedge

By October of that year, he’d found it: a $9.4 billion plan to buy Rite Aid Corp. that would have vaulted Walgreens past CVS Health Corp. to become by far the largest U.S. drugstore chain. But after he spent almost two years wooing government officials and investors, regulators prevented Walgreens from swallowing Rite Aid. In September 2017, Pessina had to settle for buying 1,932 Rite Aid stores, less than half as many as his original target. As it turns out, that might have spared Walgreens an even more painful reckoning than the one it now faces. On April 2 shares of the company plummeted 13 percent after it said earnings would be stagnant for the rest of its fiscal year, which ends on Aug. 31. Pessina, who owns 15.9 percent of Walgreens shares, lost $1.2 billion of his personal wealth in one day; the stock’s total decline since his Britain-centered Alliance Boots drugstore chain merged with the U.S.-based chain has reached 28 percent.",RAD,en,Bloomberg
