Chris Carey initiated or transferred coverage of the following stocks: Coty Inc (NYSE: COTY ): downgraded from Equal-Weight to Underweight with a price target lifted from $4 to $5. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE: CL ): initiated at Underweight, $80 price target. Clorox Co (NYSE: CLX ): initiated at Overweight, $250 price target. Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG ): initiated at Overweight, $160 price target. Coty: Valuation Concerns : Coty's stock is expensive after gaining 150% in the past six months and implies a valuation of around 38 times 2021 estimated EPS and 21 times 2022 estimated EPS, Carey said in the downgrade note. This is not only ""historically expensive"" versus the stock's average multiples but a 50%/8% premium to the home and personal care group and an even larger 64%/24% premium to the S&P 500 index, the analyst said.

2020-11-28 13:45:56-05:00,"Notable Insider Buys in the Past Week: Biglari, Coty, Danaher, Foot Locker And More","Insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors when markets face uncertainty. This past week, some insiders add to their stakes in a retailer, a beauty products maker and a couple of conglomerates. A couple of biopharmaceutical companies saw insiders acquiring some shares as well. Conventional wisdom says that insiders and 10% owners really only buy shares of a company for one reason -- they believe the stock price will rise and they want to profit from it. So insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors, particularly when there is uncertainty in the markets, as there was before and after the elections and as the pandemic worsens. Though buy windows remain closed for some insiders during what is left of the earnings-reporting season, plenty of others continued to purchase shares despite some market volatility and economic uncertainty. Here are some of the most noteworthy insider purchases that were reported in the past week. A Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE: FL ) beneficial owner purchased more than 509,500 shares of this footwear retailer at $38.46 to $38.69 apiece early last week.",COTY,en,Benzinga

2019-12-26 23:59:47-05:00,How Instagram changed the way we shop,"By Sarah HalzackThe first year of the decade now drawing to a close — the following headline appeared above a modest 445-word article on a tech-industry website: “Instagram Launches With the Hope of Igniting Communication Through Images.”It’s an almost comically quaint description of exactly what the company has done over the past nine years. On its way to amassing more than a billion users, Instagram has become many things: a joyful storehouse of family photos, a sledgehammer for celebrity tabloid culture, a shadowy abyss of teen bullying. Oh, and it has also become the most powerful force in shaping commerce this side of Amazon.com.The smartphone app has notably served as a platform for new forms of consumer marketing. But its influence on spending is far more profound. Because everyone now lives their lives on camera, Instagram has played a crucial role in altering both the look and nature of products people buy and the physical spaces where they shop.Certain items were elevated to the must-have list this decade because they were shareable — that is, they photographed especially well or had a flair of whimsy that racked up the likes and comments.",COTY,en,The Economic Times India
