Recently when I was trying to setup an ESG themed Model Portfolio on a platform for a new client, I was told that I could not include UBS’s EM ESG Diversified Bond ETF because the backend gatekeeper had decreed that access to this fund was not an option – and neither were any other EM ESG Bond ETFs. UBS was the first ETF provider to trailblaze the ESG cause in the Corporate Bond space, and with that innovative step it became much easier to design a family of Multi-Asset ESG ETF Model Portfolios. UBS’s decision to build out their ESG credentials must have been a hard-won battle at times and one can only imagine how they will react when they realize that on some adviser platforms the ‘computer says no’!",UBS,en,Wealth Adviser

Although the Democrats could still win a slim majority in the Senate - with January's two run-off elections in Georgia - the consensus is that it's going to go the Republicans' way. So, what does that mean for the stimulus package which the American economy is in need of? Ultimately, its fate lies with the one person more powerful than the President-elect themselves - Republican Senator, and presumptive Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell - says Sam Solem, portfolio manager at Intrepid Capital. With the power over the size and scope of any stimulus package Mitch McConnell has the ability to place the 'McConnell Cap' on any of Biden's plans, giving him the higher ground in any negotiations on economic and fiscal stimulus.

Here's how a UBS investment chief believes investors can trade short-term market volatility and protect their portfolios in the long term,"Summary List Placement Markets were pricing in the prospect of a Democratic sweep as the outcome of the November 3 US election. But that hasn't happened. President Donald Trump has won key state Florida, a state that was seen as the ticket for a ""blue wave"" if Joe Biden managed to secure it. Now the race between the two candidates is narrow and dependent on a few key states, such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. With mail-in ballots still to be counted, the results could potentially take days. Investors were largely geared up for an obvious Democrat win. But uncertainty also brings opportunity, according to Caroline Simmons, the UK chief investment officer for investment bank and wealth manager, UBS. ""This [is the] scenario markets were hoping for the least because it's got the most uncertainty,"" she said. The current status of the outcome is ""obviously an uncertain setback"", Simmons said, but as CIO for a leading global wealth manager managing over $2.3 trillion assets, one market event will not impact the firm's global and diverse portfolios, she said.",UBS,en,Business Insider

Two ADS represent one ordinary share.Lufax is going public in the U.S. as relations between Washington and Beijing are at a low ebb, with the world’s two biggest economies clashing over trade, access to capital markets and data privacy. In August, U.S. regulators threatened to ban Chinese companies from listing on American exchanges, citing Beijing’s refusal to allow inspections of the firms’ audits. Nevertheless, firms based in China and Hong Kong have raised $10.9 billion through U.S. IPOs this year, the most since 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Lufax, which was once among China’s largest peer-to-peer lenders, has morphed into a financial giant offering wealth management and retail lending services.",UBS,en,Yahoo Finance

The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said serious lapses and deficiencies in management controls at Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC had contributed to the misappropriation of US$2.6 billion raised by the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund. 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) raised the funds in three bond offerings in 2012 and 2013. A Goldman Sachs spokesman said the Wall Street bank would issue a statement in due course. The 1MDB scandal has been a costly and long-running sore for the US investment bank, though there are signs it may be close to drawing a line under the affair. In July, Goldman agreed to pay US$3.9 billion to settle Malaysia's criminal probe.

Der US-TikTok-Rivale Triller verhandelt Insidern zufolge über ein Börsendebüt durch die Hintertür. Konkret gehe es darum, den Kurzvideodienst mit einer leeren Börsenhülle (SPAC) zu fusionieren, sagten mehrere mit der Angelegenheit vertraute Personen der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters. Sogenannte SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Vehicles) sammeln mit einem Börsengang Geld ein und gehen erst dann auf die Suche nach einem Unternehmen, das sie dafür kaufen könnten. Der Deal fällt in eine Zeit, in der US-Präsident Donald Trump den chinesischen TikTok-Eigner ByteDance verpflichtet hat, sich von TikTok zu trennen und dies mit der Angst vor Datenklau durch die kommunistische Regierung begründet. TikTok klagt gegen die US-Regierung, um sich gegen ein Download-Verbot der App zu wehren. Zwischenzeitlich soll auch Triller für TikTok geboten haben.

First, as home prices are a backward-looking indicator of the economy, UBS said they therefore react with a delay to economic downturns. The number of transactions declined in most cities in the second quarter of 2020 compared with the previous year, ""complicating price formation and reducing the validity of observed prices."" Second, the majority of potential home buyers didn't suffer direct income losses in the first half of 2020, UBS found. ""Credit facilities for companies and short-time work schemes mitigated the fallout from the crisis, supporting employees' housing affordability."" And third, governments helped homeowners in many cities during the lockdown periods, with increased housing subsidies, lowered taxes, and suspension of foreclosure procedures.

The LIBOR, short for London Interbank Offered Rate, is a fluctuating short-term interest rate that influences the way other interest rates are set in the world of finance. It serves as a scale for setting the interest earned by debt instruments, like bonds and derivatives, and the interest charged on consumer loans. An estimated $350 trillion worth of outstanding loans and trading contracts around the world are based on LIBOR. What is LIBOR? Somewhat like the US federal funds rate , LIBOR is an interbank rate: It reflects the interest that major banks charge each other when borrowing for brief periods — anywhere from overnight to 12 months. Actually, there's no one LIBOR. It is based on five major currencies – the US dollar, the Swiss franc, the euro, the pound sterling, and the Japanese yen. Each currency is compiled for loans of seven different durations, ranging from one night to one year (see ""current LIBOR rate"" below).",UBS,en,Business Insider

They measured each market on year-over-year changes in home prices and sales, the share of homes selling for more than their list price, how fast homes are selling, and searches on Redfin. But what has been driving the spike in homebuyer interest? The boom in single-family homes in such markets was one of five major changes that UBS saw coming to real estate as a result of the pandemic in a late August report . ""The single-family housing market has been a clear, if somewhat unexpected, beneficiary of COVID-19,"" the report states.

A Renault Zoe electric subcompact whose monthly lease payment might equal a nice dinner for two in Paris.As car sales collapsed in Europe because of the pandemic, one category grew rapidly: electric vehicles. One reason is that purchase prices in Europe are coming tantalizingly close to the prices for cars with gasoline or diesel engines.At the moment this near parity is possible only with government subsidies that, depending on the country, can cut more than $10,000 from the final price. Carmakers are offering deals on electric cars to meet stricter European Union regulations on carbon dioxide emissions. In Germany, an electric Renault Zoe can be leased for 139 euros a month, or $164.Electric vehicles are not yet as popular in the United States, largely because government incentives are less generous.

Li took the advice — and missed out. Nio’s shares are now worth over four times more than when he sold in March. The comic animation entrepreneur, however, has no regrets.“I don’t look at the prices of stocks I’ve already sold,” Li said. “I’ve learned not to have doubts.”While the newbie U.S. traders flocking to Robinhood Markets Inc.’s booming trading app have garnered headlines, they’re not the only novices piling in to stocks listed in New York. Li is one of a new cohort of Chinese retail investors looking beyond the frenzied local A-share market and overseas for opportunities.Trading volumes of U.S. stocks on Futu Holdings Ltd.’s app, China’s largest online trading platform for overseas equities, more than tripled in the first three months of the year after staying more or less constant in 2019, according to Citigroup Inc. estimates.",UBS,en,Economic Times India

Somewhat counterintuitively the Fed unveiled that banks without major net interest income - such as Goldman and Morgan Stanley (as well as the usual foreign suspects such as Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse) - would face the stiffest capital demands even though it emerged in recent quarters that balance sheet and loan exposure is in fact the biggest risk the US banking system currently faces. As shown in the table below, the capital levels determined by the Fed’s most recent stress-test process, give Goldman Sachs the highest CET1 Capital Requirement target among domestic banks, with an overall capital minimum at 13.7% of risk-weighted assets, while Morgan Stanley is second with a target of 13.4%; JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, will need to maintain 11.3% under the standards taking effect Oct. 1.",UBS,en,Zero Hedge

An earlier attempt between January and March to regain control over paper gold markets has backfired on the bullion banks. Unallocated gold account holders with LBMA member banks will shortly discover that that market is trading on vapour. According to the Bank for International Settlements, at the end of last year LBMA gold positions, the vast majority being unallocated, totalled $512bn — the London Mythical Bullion Market is a more appropriate description for the surprise to come. An awful lot of gold bulls are going to be disappointed when their unallocated bullion bank holdings turn to dust in the coming months — perhaps it’s a matter of a few weeks, perhaps only days — and synthetic ETFs will also blow up.

For an ‘outstanding’ ESG score, banks had to have a positive score in more than 90 per cent of the criteria. Benchmark criteria included culture and governance, risk management, reporting, targets and more. The report, ‘Responsible banking practices: benchmark study 2020’, found that over half of banks sampled showed ‘limited evidence’ of a sustainable approach across most criteria. Banks were often found to focus on environmentally responsible products, but product offerings were yet to fully address socio-economic issues.

A move like that would serve as a shot-in-the-arm for stock valuations and ""easily push the broad market to new highs,"" the analyst added. The market is also slated for a mass rotation from growth names to value stocks once investors reprice for weaker-than-expected coronavirus fallout, the bank said.

Postmates had initially filed to go public last year, and has postponed gearing up for an IPO multiple times. The company ultimately settled on the Uber deal because its shareholders could get Uber stock and the combined company would have a better chance at profitability. For more stories like this, sign up here for our Wall Street Insider newsletter. Postmates was ready – again – to go public. The food-delivery startup, founded in 2011, had announced in February 2019 that it had confidentially filed for an initial public offering. In the last 18 months, Postmates has repeatedly geared up for an IPO, only to turn back, first in the wake of Uber and Lyft's disappointing public-market performance, then when WeWork's IPO imploded entirely, and most recently as the coronavirus pandemic upended global markets, per a source close to the company's discussions. In between, it raised more money, nabbing $225 million in fresh funding in September 2019 that valued the startup at $2.4 billion.","UBS,UBER",en,Business Insider

When the company’s share price collapsed as an accounting scandal came to light last month, he ended up liquidating two-thirds of his holdings over two days to meet margin calls, pushing the stock even lower. Wirecard subsequently filed for insolvency.Neumann’s $500 million loan -- secured by WeWork shares -- proved problematic for investor SoftBank Group Corp., which extended credit to Neumann as part of a 2019 rescue deal that was subsequently withdrawn.

It has also raised fresh questions of whether payments regulation in Europe has kept pace with the huge changes in the industry. Once a sleepy arm of heavily regulated banks, the payments sector is being transformed by technological innovations, new legislation, new players and shifts in customer habits. Little wonder technology and payment-processing companies and banks are all vying to grab a share of the large and fast-growing market for digital payments. Modern payment chains consist of an increasing number of companies that are interdependent but do not always have shared interests. They may be under the supervision of various authorities or even under no supervision at all. That’s why last year my review of financial services for the Bank of England argued for a cross-authority review of payments regulation to reflect the shifting risks and gaps.",UBS,en,Zero Hedge

If you aren't yet a subscriber to Wall Street Insider, you can sign up here. After weeks of stock-market gains, there were signs this week of cracks in the rally. And Federal Reserve policymakers made clear they expect to hold interest rates near-zero through 2022 — and that they see a long path to an economic recovery. Major US stock indexes logged their biggest one-day loss since since mid-March on Thursday before clawing back some ground in volatile trading the next day. As Bradley Saacks reports, some big investors have been calling for a reckoning — or at least, pointing out that very little in the markets makes sense to them right now. Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones has had to eat ""some humble pie"" as the markets surged, but said that the pandemic has thrown off economic models so much that people would "" be better off getting financial advice from TikTok "" (this was on a Zoom call where he had a background of a starry night because he felt like he's in ""The Twilight Zone"" or ""Lost in Space."") And $135 million Aristides Capital told investors that ""the cognitive dissonance is overwhelming at times ,"" while predicting a dot-com-style crash and saying unprofitable growth stocks are ""one step above a Ponzi scheme.""

Hamann also spoke at an investor conference sponsored by investment firm UBS on June 2. Although international intermodal volumes have fallen by about 16% quarter-to-date amid canceled vessel sailings to U.S. West Coast ports, the railroad is ""feeling just a tad more optimistic"" amid expectations that volumes might have bottomed out in April and May, Hamann said on June 2.

With miners virtually unearthing new ‘coins’ every day via a decentralised system that operates beyond the influence of government, it’s easy to see the attraction. Since the start of 2020, Bitcoin has appreciated over 35 per cent, while “old” gold rose 11 per cent, and the S&P 500 index of US stocks was flat. But the majority of institutional investors are only just starting to dip a toe into crypto waters. Just over a third of institutional investors say they are currently invested in digital assets, according to a recent survey by Fidelity Digital Assets. With six out of ten saying they believe digital assets have a place in their portfolio, crypto may be about to hit the mainstream. “One of the biggest blocks to investment is liquidity, and the other is the legal answer.",UBS,en,InstitutionAlassetManager

Reaching an early climax this year, DeFi breached $1 billion in locked assets.

Yes, of course, it could be. Desperate governments will take desperate actions. And as the world economy is now slumping into a hyperinflationary depression, unlimited money printing will cause currencies to collapse, leading to a surge in the gold price measured in worthless paper money. So the first question we must ask is: Why would governments punish prudent savers who have taken protection in gold against the irresponsible mismanagement of the economy and the currency? GOLD IS 0.5% OF GLOBAL ASSETS Global financial assets are estimated by Credit Suisse to be $360 trillion. Of that stocks are $85 trillion or 24%. The global bond market is $100 trillion (28%). Investment gold is around 35,000 tonnes or $1.9 trillion. This represents a mere 0.5% of global financial assets. With investment gold representing only 0.5% of global assets whilst stocks are 24%, you can ask why the US government, are doing all they can do drive up the value of stocks by printing money and at the same time suppressing the price of gold.",UBS,en,Zero Hedge

2020-05-05 15:48:00-05:00,5 Reasons Why Institutional Investors Refuse to Join the Crypto Sector,"Crypto investors have long believed that institutional investors would lead to the next Bitcoin moon event but this is a false narrative built on nothing more than hope. For the past two years, crypto-media outlets and Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocates have placed heavy emphasis on the need for institutional investors to embrace the cryptocurrency sector. The oft-stated belief was that institutional inflow would lead to mass adoption and an incredible spike in the value of crypto-assets as a whole. Fast forward to the present, and the total cryptocurrency market capitalization has yet to reach the $750 billion all-time high seen in late 2017. The slow recovery of crypto prices raises a few hard to answer questions. If institutional funds have been flowing into cryptocurrencies, why hasn’t there been a significant price increase over the last three years? Either there is an almost infinite sell pressure — which shouldn’t be a barrier considering the total crypto market cap is just $248 billion — or this theory that institutional investment will pump crypto prices does not hold.",UBS,en,Cointelegraph

According to the quarterly European fund industry report from Refinitiv’s Lipper team, bond funds faced the highest overall outflows at EUR73.9 billion, followed by alternative UCITS funds (EUR32.9 billion outflows), mixed-assets funds (EUR18.5 billion outflows), and real estate funds (EUR2.8 billion in outflows). “The flows were mainly driven by developments around the spread of the coronavirus and the lockdowns of economies around the globe since these circumstances may lead to a global recession with further falling stock markets,” says Detlef Glow, head of Lipper EMEA Research at Refinitiv. Not all funds saw outflows, however, with best-selling equity global sector seeing inflows of EUR8.1 billion, and commodities funds gaining EUR5.5 billion. “These flows indicate that European investors returned to risk-off mode over the course of the first quarter of 2020,” says Glow.",UBS,en,institutionalassetmanager.co.uk

Portfolio manager Alberto Gallo, who runs the Algebris Macro Credit Fund, said that while the market outlook is “bumpy”, there are “very good returns” available in credit markets for patient investors. Gallo’s strategy - which trades bank debt, sovereigns, and investment grade and high yield corporate debt, has so far advanced 2.68 per cent month-to-date. Having initially remained cautious throughout January and February, putting more than half of the portfolio in cash, Gallo did not expect the market reaction to the Covid-19 outbreak to be as deep as the 2008 slide. But speaking on Algebris Investments’ podcast update, he noted how the sharp unwind of heavily levered funds – especially in the hedge fund space – has compounded the sell-off to create value across good quality assets. “We took advantage of that and we invested the fund up to 70-75 per cent, adding in assets which are solid companies that are strategic and can resist even in a prolonged shutdown,” he explained, citing telecom companies such as Vodafone and Telefonica, larger systemic banks including Société Générale, Barlcays and ING, and Citigroup in the US, and US industrials such as General Electric. “We have improved the quality of our portfolio,” he said of recent positioning.",UBS,en,Hedgeweek

Most advertisers say the pandemic has already impacted ad spending, and the majority expect to shrink their budgets for the rest of the year because of it. While TV advertising is still declining, it's expected to steal some dollars away from digital in the coming months, because of the current political cycle and the uptick in TV viewership as more people stay at home.

In response, the experts attempted to quantify the damage that this crisis will do to the $8 trillion corporate-debt market.

Investor sentiment was different just a few months ago when the economic expansion was still in full swing.

2020-04-02 09:18:58-05:00,"UBS Sees April, May Freight 'Falloff'","On a Wednesday conference call with the firm's clients, UBS Group AG (NYSE: UBS ) freight transportation analyst Tom Wadewitz said he expects a ""falloff"" in rail and truck volumes in April and May. He said the coronavirus-related volume surge in recent weeks has created a consumer inventory buildup of at-home essentials like groceries and household supplies. He noted that e-commerce shipments may be more resilient moving forward, but cautioned investors that the growth in business-to-consumer volumes is likely skewed to lower-margin goods. Wadewitz believes that recent spot market metrics and data could be indicating that the market is setting up for something worse than the industrial recession in 2015 and 2016. However, he believes that freight markets still have a distance to go before experiencing the degradation seen during the global financial crisis of 2008-2009.

UBS says it managed a CHF4.3 billion profit last year, but this was nevertheless a fall year-on-year while the bank was also hit by a huge tax evasion fine in France. Ermotti and chairman Axel Weber, who saw his pay drop from CHF6 million to CHF5.2 million, were punished partially for the CHF5 billion financial sanction imposed by a Paris court last year – a conviction the bank is appealing. As a result of the French legal reversal, several executives will not be awarded some of the performance-related remuneration that had been set aside for them. UBS shareholders will have the chance to vote either for or against the amount of executive pay at the banks’ annual general meeting on April 29.

As ITV's Peston tweeted, Johnson is to change the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to put into law that transition arrangements with EU, during which UK is in effect non-voting member of EU, must end 31 Dec 2020, which he noted will be seen as increasing the risk of delayed no-deal Brexit. The news, which was repeated by a number of media outlets, would be a jolt to those who believed that the PM will use his big majority to transition to a softer relationship with the EU, as DB notes. This will raise the stakes for negotiators on both sides to conclude a trade deal. ",UBS,en,Zero Hedge

The Fairfield County market has seen positive trends emerge due to improvements in the commercial business district office sector. This is likely the result of the weeding out of less competitive buildings and growth in other commercial markets, such as apartment buildings, medical and other uses. As developers and landlords in and around Stamford's city center continue to create critical masses of housing, office space and entertainment venues with proximity to the city's transportation hub, Stamford will continue to capture its fair share of office users. Looking towards 2020, overall vacancy is projected to drop in lower Fairfield County and demand is anticipated to remain relatively unchanged.",UBS,en,Connecticut Post

Other weaker lenders such as Dewan Housing Finance Corp. and Anil Ambani’s Reliance Capital Ltd. are struggling, putting the loans they received from a handful of the regulated banks at risk.“There will be some defaults, some additional slippages on banks’ books from the NBFC sector and that will be reflected in the performance of some of the bank stocks, which are more exposed to the weak NBFCs,” said Suresh Ganapathy, an associate director overseeing financial research at Macquarie Capital Securities in India.Among the most vulnerable is Yes Bank Ltd., which has seen its shares plunge 65% in the past year amid wider worries about its lending policies.",UBS,en,The Economic Times India

The world’s largest wealth manager said 32% of high-net-worth portfolios are in cash, in a survey released on May 7.

This is a good time for investors to consider a more diversified portfolio.” Those holdings dovetail with evidence about the rally in global equities, which shows investors have been keeping some money on the sidelines even as stocks have risen solidly in 2019.

Having come of age during the Great Recession, many millennials are wary of investing — but rich millennials are more embracing of it, especially when it comes to cryptocurrency and investing outside of the US. Compared to their peers, rich millennials also sit on less cash and have a different picture of debt. Rich millennials are of a different ilk. Not only do they spend and display their money differently from rich baby boomers , they also have financial habits that distinguish them from the rest of their own generation. It's a unique distinction considering that life is, in general, more expensive today for millennials than it was for previous generations. Investing is another area where rich millennials significantly differ from the rest of their generation.

As a tangent we said that ""considering that cash at US banks, most of which is parked at the Fed as reserves, amounts to just under $1.5 trillion, we wonder why the Fed does not simply cut off foreign banks' eligibility for its generous IOER subsidy, and make its balance sheet eligible only to US banks. It would slash its bloated balance sheet by over $800 billion overnight. Oh yes, that may actually test the widely accepted theory that banks outside the US are ""safe."" Almost two years later, while the Fed has yet to move on curbing foreign bank subsidies courtesy of IOER, the US central bank is finally considering stricter rules on foreign bank branches to tighten what critics say is a loophole that has allowed overseas lenders to shield assets from the toughest U.S. bank rules , while collecting billions in annual hand outs courtesy of reserves parked with the Fed.",UBS,en,Zero Hedge

Now, with tax session approaching its peak, we can quantify just how big the ""shortfall"" at least relative to taxpayer expectations and Wall Street estimates will be. As UBS calculates, the realized net payments to households are now running below the bank's forecast, with the cumulative shortfall rising to a whopping $45.5bln , an amount which could have significant adverse implications on Americans' spending habits if most taxpayers had expected their 2019 refund to be similar to 2018. That said, there is a specific reason why refunds have been running behind expectations: last week’s dramatic shortfall in tax refunds arises largely from timing of refunds that include the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit. According to the Department of Treasury, the IRS had processed less than half of those payments, whereas in 2018 all such credits had been completed (Treasury statement).",UBS,en,Zero Hedge

""This action ensures that the majority of directors on the En+ and Rusal boards will be independent directors, including US and European persons, who have no business, professional, or family ties to Deripaska or any other specially designated individuals, and that independent US persons vote a significant bloc of the shares of En +,” the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said in a statement.",UBS,en,Zero Hedge
2019-01-25 11:10:50-05:00,UBS Slashes Bonus Pool For European And Asian Bankers By 20%,"Like the old saying goes: Mo' money, mo' problems. In the latest sign that times are getting tougher for finance professionals, UBS's army of wealth managers might need to forgo buying that new sports car or - god forbid - consider moving their kids to slightly less prestigious private schools this year as the bank has reportedly informed some of its bankers in Asia and Europe that they could see their bonuses cut by as much as 20%, according to Bloomberg. The cuts come amid a rash of layoffs and compensation cuts in the financial services industry as the explosion of volatility in Q4 did the industry no favors from a profitability standpoint (contrary to the conventional wisdom that volatility is good for the bottom line). CEO Sergio Ermotti, who has been struggling to meed bank-wide profitability targets, reportedly told the bankers that the shrinking bonus pool for the wealth management unit - which is seen as a key profit center for the Swiss bank - is due to a slight miss on the unit's profitability targets for 2018.",UBS,en,Zero Hedge
2019-01-24 18:25:00-05:00,"Shutdown Now Costs $1 BIlion Per Day, And Consumer Sentiment Is Starting To Slide","The partial government shutdown is in its 34th day and counting, and it is starting to have a significant effect on the economy. According to Brian Rose, senior economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, the closure is now costing the economy about $1 billion a day , and if Q1 growth is zero or negative as a result - as administration officials admitted may happen earlier this week - it likely won't see a sharp rebound in Q2 even if the shutdown ends, for reasons including that it may be tough to replace workers who quit; as a result one should think about that famous hockey-stick graph when projecting the pace of the growth hit from the shutdown according to UBS. This is what Rose said in terms of calculating the direct impact of the shutdown: The direct impact from the shutdown-the loss in real government expenditures-is purely mechanical: calculate the loss in aggregate hours worked and you get about a 0.1pp drag to growth every two weeks the government remains shuttered. The indirect impact-how consumers and businesses respond-is harder to quantify.",UBS,en,Zero Hedge

As Bloomberg notes, that’s at odds with large realized swings in U.S. stocks -- a potentially unsustainable divergence. “Market internals imply a VIX of 31 based on trailing realized volatility and five-day SPX returns,” UBS Group AG strategist Stuart Kaiser wrote in a note about the gauge’s fair value. “60-day realized volatility above 25 percent is the largest driver of that estimate.” With big down days for the stock market likely, the sizable gap between implied and historic price swings may be untenable, according to Wells Fargo & Co. strategist Pravit Chintawongvanich. “Historically, when VIX diverges this much from realized vol, it usually ‘catches up’ sometime in the next month,” he wrote in a note Wednesday. “The VIX has dropped rapidly as the market rallies, despite high realized volatility.",UBS,en,Zero Hedge
