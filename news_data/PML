2019-07-10 16:21:27-05:00,CASE STUDY: Interview with PayPal COO Bill Ready on how Venmo evolved from a P2P powerhouse into a full-suite commerce engine (PYPL),"PayPal has long been a commerce enabler, offering highly popular services like PayPal OneTouch, a buy button with a wide reach in addition to loyalty and conversions that far surpass the competition's. But it's also a leader in the digital peer-to-peer (P2P) payments space, as a wider set of users turn to PayPal apps, including Braintree-owned Venmo, for fast, simple, and convenient ways to pay their friends and family. As digital P2P grows, and users continue to spend and buy online more than ever, PayPal has identified an opportunity to grow its commerce presence onto another platform, expand the services it offers, and better serve its customers in a time where returns and margins are shrinking across the payments space. Business Insider Intelligence spoke to PayPal COO Bill Ready about how the firm is working to evolve Venmo — one of the most ""beloved"" apps in the millennial demographic and a P2P market leader — from a P2P offering to a full suite commerce engine.

2019-06-18 07:42:00-05:00,A computer science student scraped 7 million Venmo transactions to warn other users about their privacy (PYPL),"This is an excerpt from a story delivered exclusively to Business Insider Intelligence Payments Briefing subscribers. To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here . Computer science student Dan Salmon scraped 7 million Venmo transactions between July 2018 and February 2019 as a warning to other users of the Paypal-owned peer-to-peer (P2P) payment app to set their accounts to private, per TechCrunch . Salmon was able to scrape 40 transactions per minute, amounting to 57,600 transactions per day. Venmo's faced backlash from regulators and consumers regarding its privacy over the past year — but Salmon's effort shows users are still concerned. PayPal settled with the FTC last year over privacy and security violations, saying it would change its disclosure to more clearly tell users how to limit the sharing of transaction details. But last year, another user raised concern after accessing 207 million Venmo transactions — and Salmon's efforts show that Venmo still has work to do.",PML,en,Business Insider

2019-04-26 09:31:00-05:00,Venmo's 40 million US users show its dominance in the P2P space (PYPL),"This is an excerpt from a story delivered exclusively to Business Insider Intelligence Payments Briefing subscribers. To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here . PayPal's strong Q1 2019 was highlighted by results from Venmo that indicate the service's dominance in the US peer-to-peer (P2P) payments space. Additionally, bank-owned P2P service Zelle announced its Q1 2019 numbers, which shed some new light on the industry's competitive dynamic. Here's what it means: Venmo is a force to be reckoned with in the P2P space — but it isn't without competition. Venmo counts 40 million active accounts in the US. That figure, which equates to roughly 14.5% of PayPal's total user base, puts it among the largest platforms in the US: For context, Venmo's user base is comparable to Uber's US user base. The service also posted $21 billion in volume last quarter, marking growth of 73% annually — a slight deceleration from Q1 2018's 80% growth rate, but still a massive gain. ",PML,en,Business Insider

To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here .

BofA counts 37 million active digital banking users, 27.1 million of whom use mobile banking: That's a 9% annual increase in active mobile banking users, consistent sequentially with growth in Q4 2018 . Still, it's a slight deceleration from the 12% annual growth BofA saw in active mobile users in Q1 2018, when it counted 24.8 million active users. Despite that slight deceleration in user growth, BofA saw healthy engagement on its digital channels, with 1.5 billion mobile logins, up from 1.4 billion mobile logins in Q1 2018.",PML,en,Business Insider
2019-04-16 08:34:00-05:00,China's Dianrong is seeking $100 million to help cope with a regulatory crackdown,"This is an excerpt from a story delivered exclusively to Business Insider Intelligence Fintech Briefing subscribers. To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here . One of China's biggest peer-to-peer (P2P) lenders, Dianrong , is looking to raise $100 million to help cope with a regulatory crackdown that's already led the firm to lay off as many as 2,000 workers , per the Financial Times. Dianrong is attempting to raise the funds from new and existing investors including Singapore sovereign fund GIC and Standard Chartered Private Equity. The new capital is intended to help the firm survive until regulators begin accrediting a select number of P2P lenders. Here's what it means: China's clampdown on alt lenders has taken its toll and Dianrong's attempt to raise the new funds may be a shot in the dark as regulatory uncertainty lingers. Amid a wave of defaults, fraudulent practices, and investor anger, authorities have taken steps to curb the industry. Incumbents' unwillingness to lend, a growing cash-rich middle class, and an absence of regulatory oversight helped China's P2P lending space gain considerable traction.",PML,en,Business Insider
