At least that’s what it looked like Wednesday, the second day this week of major indices plunging and fixed income gaining ground. The S&P 500 Index (SPX) fell 3.5%, and volatility soared. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) climbed above 40 for the first time since June 15. Worse, perhaps, is that the major indices all stumbled into the close and finished near their session lows as no sector escaped the carnage. The late move lower doesn’t exactly bode well for Thursday. Many investors have enjoyed a good run the last six months or so and appear to feel like taking profits and risk off the table until after the election is resolved. That might be a longer process than usual and may not get done next Tuesday, which is something you have to keep in mind. At the same time, virus counts and, perhaps more significantly, hospitalization rates are up across the U.S., and traders have been keeping their eye on that statistic as something to be concerned about.","GE,GEC",en,Benzinga

The other view, that of the road ahead, seems less certain. On the economic front, durable goods data out yesterday looked pretty good, but that data point is backward looking, and a separate report showed consumer expectations are dropping amid rising COVID-19 cases and continued high unemployment. (See more on both below.) Analysts are expecting third-quarter GDP, scheduled for release Thursday, to show a pretty solid recovery from the depths of the virus, but looking ahead, case counts and hospitalizations are seeming ominous, both here and in Europe.

You can hold virtual meetings with virtual friends using virtual reality systems hosted on virtual servers. And in energy circles, one of the biggest buzzwords in recent years is the virtual power plant, or VPP. The term first started to be bandied about in the 1990s. But VPPs have really taken off in the last 10 years, not just as a concept but as something that a growing number of energy companies are creating, using and commercializing. Here’s the real deal on this virtual energy phenomenon. Explain this ‘VPP’ thing… According to Germany’s Next Kraftwerke, one of the pioneers of modern VPPs, it’s “a network of decentralized, medium-scale power generating units such as wind farms, solar parks and combined heat and power units, as well as flexible power consumers and storage systems.” In practice, a VPP can be made up of multiple units of a single type of asset, such as a battery or a device in a demand response program, or a heterogeneous mix of assets.","GE,GEC",en,Green Technology Media

2020-10-20 13:39:32-05:00,We got an exclusive look at the pitch deck that Tony Fadell-backed Menlo Micro used to raise a $44 million Series B to reinvent the electric switch,"Summary List Placement The circuit breaker was invented by Thomas Edison in 1897, and if you ask Menlo Micro CEO Russ Garcia, not much has changed with the technology since then. That's why the company — which was spun-off from GE Ventures , the investing arm of General Electric, in 2016 — sought to tackle the challenge. ""We've reinvented the most basic electronics component that there is,"" Garcia told Business Insider, boasting that the firm has achieved something that over 40 firms failed to do over the past two decades. Instead of a solid-state switch that Garcia says loses a good amount of power when turned on or off, Menlo Micro's tech requires ""almost no power to turn-off and doesn't lose energy while it is on."" Drawing on inspiration from the semiconductor industry, the alloy-based switches are also much smaller, which means they can be used in a much wider array of applications, according to Garcia. The firm recently raised $44 million in a Series B funding round led by 40 North Ventures.","GE,GEC",en,Business Insider

First there was Henry Paulson, who led the charge to take Goldman public in 1999. When Paulson was tapped to become George W. Bush's Treasury Secretary in May 2006, he chose Lloyd Blankfein. Twelve years later, Blankfein selected Solomon. Under the current CEO's predecessors, Goldman made the inconsistent and halting steps away from its partnership and toward something more like a publicly traded corporation. Pre-recorded earnings calls moved to a model where the CFO would banter with analysts. Last year, Solomon asked his lieutenants to create three-year strategic plans.

2020-09-21 11:41:49-05:00,General Electric will keine Kohlekraftwerke mehr bauen,"Kein Zeitpunkt für Produktionsstopp genannt. Bisherige Verpflichtungen werden erfüllt. General Electric (GE) will aus dem Bau von Kohlekraftwerken aussteigen. Man werde sich mehr auf erneuerbare Energiequellen konzentrieren, teilte der Siemens-Rivale am Montag mit. Einen Zeitpunkt für den Produktionsstopp nannte GE nicht. Der US-Industriekonzern werde aber bestehende Verpflichtungen gegenüber den Kunden erfüllen. Das Unternehmen ließ offen, was aus der Sparte werden soll. Das Aus für Kohlekraftwerke könne Werksschließungen und Arbeitsplatzverluste bedeuten, auch ein Verkauf sei möglich, teilte das Unternehmen mit. Zuletzt hatte GE mit dem Bau von Turbinen für Kohle- und Dampfkraftwerke noch rund eine Milliarde Dollar (850 Mio. Euro) im Jahr umgesetzt. Umsatzstärker und lukrativer sind aber die Wartungs- und Dienstleistungsverträge mit den Betreibern. Kathy Hipple, Analystin beim Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, sagte, der Schritt werde an den Märkten positiv aufgenommen. ""Der Ausstieg von GE aus kohlebefeuerten Kraftwerken - nachdem das Unternehmen hier jahrzehntelang Marktführer war - ist das Eingeständnis, dass das Wachstum im Energiesektor nicht länger in der Kohle liegt.""

But two decades ago, who imagined a market where GE and Exxon were almost afterthoughts? The amount of money invested in Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Facebook today is staggering, as Goldman Sachs Chief US Equity Strategist David Kostin says the stock market hasn't been this top-heavy in 40 years. But it will change one day, and Kostin says people are hungry for the next big thing. ""Investors are increasingly searching for fast-growing firms beyond the 'current five,'"" he wrote. Finding those potential replacements starts with a focus on the incredible growth that made those five companies so successful. ""The ability of these firms to grow sales rapidly regardless of the economic situation has been brought into focus by the corona crisis,"" he said. ""Growth is particularly important with interest rates at the lower bound. "" So Kostin and his team applied their "" Rule of Ten "" framework and sought companies that reported annual revenue growth of at least 10% in 2018 and 2019, and are expected to maintain that level in 2021 and 2022.","GE,GEC",en,Business Insider

But despite its real claim to innovation, Silicon Valley has also come to represent something less tangible. Andrew Russell, professor of history and dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at SUNY Polytechnic Institute, and Lee Vinsel, a professor in the Department of Science, Technology, and Society at Virginia Tech, call it “innovation speak.” The two are the author of a new book, called The Innovation Delusion, that explores the deep problems with the Silicon Valley-inspired mindset that shiny new things can solve all of society’s problems. Instead, Russell and Vinsel advocate for what they call a “maintenance mindset,” which focuses on keeping the technology we already have up and running rather than always looking for the next new thing. Russell and Vinsel run a research network and conference series called the Maintainers , which focuses on values of upkeep, repair, and sustainable labor.",GE,en,Fast Company

2020-08-28 09:23:00-05:00,Bill Gates’ Nuclear Reactor Company Adds Molten Salt Storage to Its SMR System,"TerraPower, the Bill Gates-backed nuclear innovation firm, has launched a new small modular reactor (SMR) system paired with molten salt storage unit. The new concept, Natrium, is being developed in partnership with GE Hitachi Nuclear Power. According to the pair, it could be used to boost a 345-megawatt SMR to around 500-megawatts for a period of up to five hours. TerraPower, founded by Gates in 2008, is developing two separate SMR technologies. The sodium fast reactor used in the Natrium concept produces large volumes of heat over and above what is required to drive its steam turbines. The company has previously flagged this as a potential source of process heat or for energy storage. The Natrium system gives it a commercial concept for the latter. “We designed this system with operator input to potentially increase their revenues by 20 percent through the use of energy storage,” said Jay Wileman, GEH president and CEO, in a statement. The addition of dispatchable power, via the thermal storage, makes the system more than an expensive piece of baseload without the benefit of scale.",GE,en,Green Technology Media

But whether utilities will have the ability — or need — to compete with oil companies in the emerging hydrogen market remains an open question. To date, gigawatt-scale announcements in the hydrogen sector have been dominated by the likes of Shell, BP and Equinor, typically involving plans for meeting large sources of existing, gigawatt-scale demand in industrial clusters and in some cases their own oil refining operations. Prolonging the lifespan of multi-billion dollar gas infrastructure investments makes for another compelling incentive. But big utilities in Europe and North America, increasingly large actors on the global energy stage, are not staying on the sidelines. In the U.S., NextEra recently announced a 20-megawatt electrolyzer , essentially designed to produce green hydrogen for self-consumption at a gas-fired plant in Florida.",GE,en,Green Technology Media

Y cada vez es más pequeño. En una sociedad que ha evolucionado sin respiro en las últimas décadas, las marcas, incluso las que parecen más sólidas, están expuestas a una caducidad inmediata si no avanzan al ritmo de ese cambio. Un informe del profesor de Yale Richard Foster puso cifras a ese vértigo desatado: si en 1958 la longevidad media de las empresas del S&P500 (las mayores cotizadas de EE.UU.) era de 61 años, en 1980 se había reducido a 25 y había caído hasta los 18 en la segunda década del sigloXXI. Un repaso al tradicional ranking «BrandZ 2020» de Kantar y WPP, recientemente publicado, confirma que, ahora más que nunca, la tecnología marca el camino. Y se recorre en un sprint permanente en el que EE.UU. lidera el pelotón, el aliento del perseguidor chino cada vez se siente más cerca y Europa resuella descolgada, sin protagonismo.

San Diego's smart streetlight initiative — launched in 2016 through a partnership with General Electric, which provided a $30 million loan to fund the project — was originally intended to reduce energy costs and inform transit operations using anonymized data. The purview of the project expanded after its launch, however, as police began requesting access to streetlight video footage in mid-2018, per The Voice of San Diego. In May 2020, Mayor Kevin Faulconer advocated shutting down many of the smart streetlights, although doing so would leave the city owing considerable debt to General Electric.

A strand of classic white string lights can upgrade just about any space, whether it's your dorm room or backyard gazebo. All you need to light up the dark corners of your home is a working outlet or pack of batteries. In addition to giving off that good old nostalgic glow, LED string lights are longer-lasting, safer, and more eco-friendly than classic incandescent string lights. It's true LED string lights are usually a bit more expensive up front, but since they last for thousands of hours and use very little energy, they are a more cost-effective option overall. Whether you're looking for classic white, holiday colors, indoor, outdoor, solar, or vintage bistro varieties, we have a pick for you.",GE,en,Business Insider

Portfolio manager Alberto Gallo, who runs the Algebris Macro Credit Fund, said that while the market outlook is “bumpy”, there are “very good returns” available in credit markets for patient investors. Gallo’s strategy - which trades bank debt, sovereigns, and investment grade and high yield corporate debt, has so far advanced 2.68 per cent month-to-date. Having initially remained cautious throughout January and February, putting more than half of the portfolio in cash, Gallo did not expect the market reaction to the Covid-19 outbreak to be as deep as the 2008 slide. But speaking on Algebris Investments’ podcast update, he noted how the sharp unwind of heavily levered funds – especially in the hedge fund space – has compounded the sell-off to create value across good quality assets. “We took advantage of that and we invested the fund up to 70-75 per cent, adding in assets which are solid companies that are strategic and can resist even in a prolonged shutdown,” he explained, citing telecom companies such as Vodafone and Telefonica, larger systemic banks including Société Générale, Barlcays and ING, and Citigroup in the US, and US industrials such as General Electric. “We have improved the quality of our portfolio,” he said of recent positioning.",GE,en,Hedgeweek

But doctors also say that ventilators can be damaging to the lungs, and while it may be an effective way to treat other respiratory illnesses, some are now looking for alternative treatments. There is still a global ventilator shortage, with doctors and healthcare systems calling for more to be urgently made or bought to treat the worst-affected patients.

Could unlocking wind farms' ability to provide ancillary grid services help to stimulate California's moribund wind market? In tests conducted at the Tule wind farm last year, California’s grid operator determined that the project could provide essential services to the grid. The ability to provide those ancillary services could make it easier to add variable renewable energy sources to the grid, according to the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), which published a report (PDF) on the research project this month. The 131-megawatt Tule project, which is operated by Avangrid Renewables, is equipped with an inverter-based smart controller that sends signals to all 57 turbines in the project, so they can operate as a single plant. The tests determined that ancillary services typically provided by natural gas generators such as voltage regulation control, active power control, and frequency response can be supplied by a commercial wind farm outfitted with a plant-level controller. “This means wind can be another way to inject stability into the grid from renewables sources, and to create commercial paths for incorporating rising amounts onto the grid,” Clyde Loutan, report co-author and renewable energy advisor, CAISO, said in a statement (PDF).",GE,en,Green Technology

Might the Oracle of Omaha have some interest in some suddenly very turbulent airline stocks? Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc .

Last year’s orders crushed previous records in the wind industry, and represented 65 percent growth on 2018, according to new figures from market researcher Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables. A number of key markets put up stellar growth figures, including the U.S., which is the middle of its own historic wind boom. But 2019’s real story was China, where an almost unbelievable 50 gigawatts of wind turbine orders were placed as developers moved to lock in equipment ahead of an expiring feed-in tariff and to take advantage of new transmission lines. The entire global wind market has been installing somewhere between 50 and 60 gigawatts annually in recent years. “China was just off the chain,” said Luke Lewandowski, research director at Wood Mackenzie. Signed contracts don’t automatically translate into finished projects, Lewandowski said in an interview. “It will be interesting to see how much of that [100 gigawatts] gets realized, not only because of the coronavirus.""

In total Europe installed 15.4GW of new wind energy in 2019, three quarters of which was installed onshore, bringing overall wind power capacity to date to 205GW and providing 15 per cent of the electricity consumption across the continent, the latest figures show. While the UK installed the most new wind farms, particularly offshore, Germany was only just behind with 2.2GW of new capacity in 2019, although this includes the country's lowest rate of new onshore wind additions in 20 years at 1.1GW amid a shortage of suitable sites.

Wind turbine makers and project developers will continue to introduce new technologies and cut costs, but “constraints on technology innovation are on the horizon,” at least for onshore wind farms, WoodMac said Wednesday, highlighting key trends for the industry. Those constraints might not be such a problem for the wind business, with onshore wind already the cheapest option for new power generation in many parts of the world. But large-scale solar plants are increasingly competitive with onshore wind even in markets like Texas, where wind has long dominated. And solar technology likely has significantly more room to run on cost reductions. Add to that the fact that solar pairs more naturally with grid-scale batteries in many instances, and the wind industry has good reason to be nervous about its competitive position against solar in a growing number of markets “Solar power has emerged as the biggest threat to onshore wind’s dominance in the decarbonization battle,” WoodMac wrote.",GE,en,Green Technology

Revenues surged 20 percent year on year, to €12.1 billion, with 2020 guidance set at €14-15 billion. CEO Henrik Andersen, who took the reins last year, said execution costs had increased in 2019 due to ""trade wars and tariffs,"" a dynamic that looks set to continue in 2020. The U.S. is the largest single market for the Danish company. Vestas delivered a record 12.9 gigawatts of turbines last year, but its EBIT margin has been under pressure, falling from 13.9 percent in 2016 to 8.3 percent in 2019. Margin guidance for 2020 is 7-9 percent with a longer-term goal of lifting it to 10 percent.

This pipeline reflects an excellent opportunity for wind turbine manufacturers competing for a share of the Indian market. However, the policy transition and uncertainty in India has resulted in several turbine vendors struggling to align themselves with the changing market realities. The current policy environment is marred by very low auction prices which has compressed the profit margins of suppliers. Furthermore, installation delays due to administrative challenges have resulted in a sector slow down, idling manufacturing capacity for key suppliers. These challenges, coupled with the shift in demand towards larger high-yield turbines suited for India's wind resource profile, are set to change the future of the onshore wind supply chain in the country.

Initially TVs were a luxury item for the wealthy, but thanks to price drops, sales were booming by the end of the 1940s, and by 1989, 60% of Americans had cable. Throughout the last century, TV designs have changed from bulky to sleek, large to small — but not every new set has been a hit. Visit Insider's homepage for more stories. From ""Who Shot JR?"" to The Red Wedding, ""I Love Lucy"" to ""Friends,"" TV has offered defining moments of pop culture and modern society. Together, viewers have witnessed tragedies like 9/11 and collective joys like the Moon Landing. Television sets themselves have changed a lot in the past hundred years. What began as a large box with three channels and grainy images has evolved to high-definition flat screens with multitudes of content. Streaming sites like Netflix and Amazon Prime continue to change the way people absorb media, often placing the power in the palm of a hand.",GE,en,Business Insider

As long as three concepts are true - the market moves higher in the long run, stocks move into and out of favor, and Dow companies tend to be blue-chip stocks that are intelligently managed and financially stable - the Dogs will do well over time.

Crude is back where it was in September after the attack on Saudi oil facilities, up above $63 a barrel. Iran has vowed to retaliate, so investors might be on tenterhooks waiting for that. Volatility, which dropped sharply Thursday, scurried quickly back above 15 for the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX). One thing investors don’t want to do here is panic. Making moves out of fear isn’t a strategy. Instead, it’s often better to be prudent and let things play out.

Out of roughly 200 engines in use, IndiGo will now have to replace at least 130. India’s aviation minister, Hardeep Singh Puri, had earlier put the figure at 110.Kumar said the DGCA would decide in mid-January whether to grant IndiGo more time — beyond the current Jan. 31 deadline — before it started ordering some planes be grounded. The affected planes have continued to fly while the work is being done, since they have two engines.The increased scrutiny will add further pressure on IndiGo, which has been prohibited from adding new routes or flights until it replaces all faulty engines.",GE,en,The Economic Times India

2019-12-18 14:41:02-05:00,The US Wind PTC Cliff Keeps Looking Less and Less Scary,"For the past five years, the U.S. wind industry has been bracing for the phase-down and expiration of its production tax credit — haunted, always, by concerns about what comes next. But the PTC “cliff” looks a lot less scary than it did just a few years ago, and that was true even before the one-year extension granted this week by Congress. The bad news is that many wind projects are unlikely to reach completion by the end of 2020, the deadline for developers hoping to secure the 100 percent PTC, which is worth roughly $24 per megawatt-hour generated for 10 years. Wood Mackenzie’s latest research counts 9 gigawatts of “at risk” projects aiming for completion in 2020, potentially worth nearly $11 billion of investment. The good news is that many if not most of those projects will get built the following year at the 80 percent PTC, crimping developers’ margins but still bringing gigawatts of clean power capacity onto the grid. That spillover effect has set up a remarkable situation: It looks likely that more new wind farms will get built in 2021 at the reduced PTC than in 2019 at the full value.",GE,en,Green Technology

On Tuesday, asset manager Harbert Management Corp. announced the acquisition of an 80 percent stake in an 812-megawatt portfolio of U.S. onshore wind farms from a joint venture of GE and Enel Green Power. The deal reflects GE’s ongoing efforts to shrink its Capital arm as it restructures under Culp.

Amazon went ahead even though Elastic’s product, called Elasticsearch, was already available on Amazon.Within a year, Amazon was generating more money from what Elastic had built than the startup by making it easy for people to use the tool with its other offerings. So Elastic added premium features last year and limited what companies like Amazon could do with them. Amazon duplicated many of those features anyway and provided them free.In September, Elastic fired back. It sued Amazon in federal court in California for violating its trademark because Amazon had called its product by the exact same name: Elasticsearch.

Meanwhile, an expanded Renewable Energy division materialized with some 40,000 employees and billions of dollars in revenue. And GE's up-and-coming energy storage business took up residence in that new division under the Renewable Energy Hybrids brand. Previously, storage had nestled under Power, and before that it lived in the ill-fated Current unit, catering to commercial energy services. Years earlier GE tried and then abandoned a sodium-nickel-chloride battery manufacturing play called Durathon. As the first year under the new arrangement drew to a close, GTM sat down with GE Renewable Energy Hybrid Solutions CEO Prakash Chandra to hear how the industrial giant is leveraging energy storage to grapple with a changing energy market. “There's never been a lack of commitment to storage,"" Chandra said. ""I think we've tried to muddle through what is the best way to play in the space so we can add the most value in the entire value chain of storage.” The Durathon effort, which looks quixotic from today's perspective, developed as an effort to turn GE locomotives into diesel electric hybrids.",GE,en,Green Technology

2019-12-02 10:05:27-05:00,IndiGo wants its pilots to go easy on planes,"By Anurag KotokyNEW DELHI: IndiGo has told its pilots to stop pushing engines on its new Airbus SE jets to the limit when the planes are climbing, after India’s aviation regulator said the practice may have contributed to turbines failing in the air.All the budget airline’s A320neo aircraft now use a lower thrust setting following take off, according to a spokeswoman from IndiGo, which has suffered 13 engine shutdowns during ascents this year. The decision was taken “in order to make every possible effort to minimize exposure of engines,” she wrote in an email, adding that manufacturer Pratt & Whitney stated there’s no evidence of a connection between climbing procedure and engine incidents.Ascending at maximum power can help burn less fuel as it takes less time to reach cruising altitude. IndiGo made the switch only after India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation found in a probe - first reported by Bloomberg on Friday - that full-thrust climbs could wear down the engines and probably contributed to the shutdowns, people familiar with the matter said earlier.IndiGo instructed pilots of the A320neo-family of jets last month to use no more than 93% thrust on the Pratt engines until they reach 25,000 feet (7,622 meters), the people said.",GE,en,The Economic Times India

Yet IndiGo, one of Airbus SE’s biggest customers, is the only one to encounter turbine failures this year, drawing heavy scrutiny from the aviation regulator.The reason could be linked to how the budget airline flies. India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation told IndiGo’s operator, InterGlobe Aviation Ltd., that its practice of revving A320neo jets at full thrust right after takeoff could wear down the engines, people familiar with the matter said. By contrast, Go Air — India’s fourth-largest carrier by market share — typically uses a so-called alt-climb approach that applies less thrust, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter.Climbing at full thrust can help planes burn less fuel, two of the people said.

2019-11-04 15:52:11-05:00,9 Dividend Stocks That Are Waving Red Flags,"A strong economy typically lifts the broader market, and a rising broader-market tide will lift a lot of boats. But not all of them. Even in the midst of America's longest bull market, numerous publicly traded companies are struggling - including several dividend stocks whose payouts appear to be on thin ice. Dividend cuts and suspensions are among the worst things that can happen to shareholders - especially those that are relying on that stock for retirement income. Not only are you missing out on cash you were depending on, but the stock's value itself typically suffers ahead of - and after - that kind of announcement. Fortunately for investors, dividend cuts don't come out of nowhere. Even once-proud blue chips such as General Electric (GE) and Kraft Heinz (KHC) telegraphed considerable financial issues before ultimately slashing their regular payouts. But investors need to heed these signs. For instance, high yields - especially if a stock's yield is much higher than its industry peers - can be a sign of heightened risk and a struggling stock (as stock prices go down, dividend yields go up).",GE,en,Kiplinger Washington Editors

But many aren't even aware of how much information they have. Vendors are using machine-learning-powered products to automatically catalog data, an improvement over the physical audit that companies used to rely on consulting firms for.

Social security numbers, for example, will likely have a stricter classification than email addresses, meaning fewer employees can access the information. Click here for more BI Prime stories.

Goldman Sachs says these ""superstars"" have achieved higher profitability and outperformed their peers over the past three years. Click here for more BI Prime stories . These days, it seems like every private company that can file for an initial public offering is choosing to go that route. But the broader reality is that the number of publicly listed companies peaked in the mid-1990s and net business formation has slowed in every decade since the 1980s. Both trends have led to the emergence of corporate juggernauts that dominate their industries. Goldman Sachs analysts have identified a handful of these companies and dubbed them ""superstars."" Those firms have used their competitive advantage to earn higher margins and outperformance in the stock market during the past three years. They also garner the vast share of their industry's sales, and have translated this market share to higher profitability. ""The market positioning of superstar firms often allows for greater bargaining power over consumers and workers and higher profitability,"" said David Kostin, the chief US equity strategist, in a recent note to clients.

2019-05-09 08:00:00-05:00,Inventive Renewable Energy Storage Systems Reveal New Possibilities,"NEW YORK , May 9, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Climate change is a major concern on every countries' agenda. With the rise of the massive industries and the proliferation of vehicles, non-renewable resources such as oil and fossil fuels are rapidly depleting. Consequently, the constant use of these resources is causing adverse effects on the globe. Climate change generally occurs as a byproduct of natural forces such as the Sun, volcanoes, or even the Earth's orbit. However, the use of non-renewable powered applications is negatively accelerating climate change. The Committee on Climate Change reported that CO2 emissions have increased by over 400% since 1950. The alarming rates have thus prompted many companies to transition towards manufacturing cleaner energy sources. In particular, energy storage solutions have become a major topic of discussion in recent times. Energy storage systems consist of equipment that can conveniently store multiple forms of energy which can be utilized at any time.",GE,en,Benzinga

And despite the recovery in 2019, many of these same stocks still sport yields that are far better than their historical averages. But while some of these represent true bargains, some are dividend traps - high-yielding companies hampered by excessive risk and/or fading prospects. Dividend traps entice with rich yields almost like a siren song, only to disappoint later with dividend cuts. Even well-known companies aren't immune. Consider General Electric (GE), which once was among the bluest of blue chips but has slashed its payout twice in as many years. Another familiar name, Anheuser Busch InBev (BUD), halved its dividend in October because it had to deal with onerous debt. Unusually high yields can be a warning sign of a dividend trap, but they don't have to be. For some real estate investment trusts (REITs) and other areas of the market, well-above-market yields are the norm.",GE,en,Kiplinger

However, a problem with this argument is that it was incorrect: as the following chart of debt issues in just the last week of February shows, the US bond market is anything but fasting; in fact as a result of soaring investor demand for yield, one can argue that most companies are more than eager to add to their incremental leverage even if it means pain down the road when/if rates once again resume their trek higher.

Wertheim, 79, is a self-made billionaire worth $2.3 billion, according to Forbes ' The World's Billionaires list. His fortune comes from numerous inventions and buy-and-hold investing. Wertheim could very well be the most significant individual investor many Americans have never heard of, and he recently sat down with Forbes to prove it. Madeline Berg, a reporter at Forbes following the money, flipped through Wertheim's brokerage statements which showed hundreds of millions of dollars in tech stocks like Apple and Microsoft, purchased long ago at their IPOs. There are dozens of other blue-chip stocks in the portfolio, ranging from GE, Google, BP, and Bank of America. Here is Wertheim's interesting path into becoming a billionaire. In the early 1960s, he attended the Southern College of Optometry and after graduation started a small practice in South Florida.

According to a report in the New York Times that detailed how China and Iran have ramped up their hacking efforts since 2015, when the now-abandoned Iran deal was initially struck, and China promised the Obama administration that it would pull back on its cyberespionage efforts. After an 18-month lull, China's 10-year-long commercially motivated campaign was revitalized in the midst of growing trade tensions between the US and China (tensions that predated Trump's trade war). Among the latest targets of China's hacks, according to the NYT's military and private sources, were GE Aviation, Boeing and T-Mobile.

2019-01-31 22:34:37-05:00,Loan Fund Outflow Streak Extends To 11 Weeks As Apollo Is Forced To Pay Up For Frozen Loan,"While credit spread and leveraged loan prices rebounded sharply in the past month, the pain for leveraged loan funds has continued with another $935 million in outflows in the week ended Jan. 30, extending the losing streak to 11 weeks. According to Lipper, $718 million was pulled from mutual funds and $216 million from ETFs. In total, investors have pulled $3.15 billion from the funds year-to-date. This week’s exodus is the latest in a string of outflows for leveraged loan funds which started in mid-November, and which included four of the biggest weekly withdrawals on record. The 11 week stretch of outflows is the longest such streak since 2017 according to Bloomberg data. While in recent years loan funds saw persistent inflows on expectation of rising interest rates, this has now changed with the Fed's tightening phase now largely seen as over and the market expecting the next move from the Fed to be a rate cut. The leveraged loan market was slammed by four record-setting outflows in December, as existing loan prices plunged sharply to a more than two year low and some liquid names fell multiple points as the market was, on occasion, bidless.",GE,en,Zero Hedge

2019-01-04 18:33:14-05:00,GE Shares Rally On Report Apollo Weighing $40 Billion Bid For Aircraft-Leasing Unit,"GE shares surged more than 5% in afterhours trade, building on an impressive YTD rebound, following a Bloomberg report that private equity giant Apollo has been talking to bankers about raising debt to buy part of GE's jet-leasing business, GE Capital Aviation Services, for up to $40 billion . The report comes after several analysts questioned the value of GE's aircraft leasing business following the recent bankruptcy of helicopter leasing company Waypoint Leasing, raising the possibility of a substantial writedown. Apollo is reportedly looking to raise $30 billion in financing to purchase GE Capital Aviation Services as potential buyers weigh purchasing one of GE Capital's biggest and most profitable assets. An acquisition would go a long way toward dismantling what's left of the industrial giant's financing arm. After touching its financial crisis low of $6.66 on Dec. 12, GE shares have rebounded 13% so far this year, and were up 6% on Friday. GE's aircraft leasing unit, one of the world's largest lessors of planes, has a fleet of almost 2,000 aircraft valued at about $40 billion.",GE,en,Zero Hedge

2019-01-04 12:39:09-05:00,The 9 Best Dividend Growth Stocks in the Dow Jones,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average is one of the oldest and hallowed stock market indices in the world. Created in 1896, the Dow consists of 30 large-cap American companies, many of which pay dividends. While many companies in the Dow are considered blue chips, they certainly aren't created equal, nor are all the industrial average's dividend stocks necessarily safe bets for dependable income. In June 2018, for example, General Electric (GE) was booted from the index after having been a member for more than a century. GE's share price had slumped more than 50% in the year leading up to the firm's removal from the Dow, and management also had cut the dividend for just the second time since the Great Depression. To help identify the best dividend growth stocks in the Dow and avoid the GEs of the world, research firm Simply Safe Dividends utilizes a Dividend Safety Score system that has caught more than 98% of dividend cuts in advance. We'll use that system to take a closer look at nine Dow dividend growth stocks that appear positioned to reward shareholders with safe and solid payout expansion in the years ahead.",GE,en,Kiplinger

First, there is the psychological damage of seeing such a swoon in what is a typically good month for domestic equities. Then there is the magnitude of the decline, erasing solid YTD gains in just a few weeks and making 2018 the first down year for US stocks since the Financial Crisis a decade ago. One underappreciated problem, however, (unless you happen to manage taxable portfolios) is how money managers and investment advisors had to respond to this sudden reversal of fortune. Put yourself into their shoes for a moment: In a few days your clients will see a year-end statement with declining bond, stock, and commodity asset prices. Pretty much nothing worked this year… That will sting, but after a decade of gains that is a manageable issue. But… Say you sold some large winners earlier this year as stocks began to roll over, perhaps the large cap Tech names that everyone from hedge funds to retail investors over-weighted until recently.",GE,en,Zero Hedge
