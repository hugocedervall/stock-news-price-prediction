The proposal has won the support of the Chinese central government and relevant industry watchdogs, the people said.

This event marks not one but two firsts: Cambodia's first gas imports and China's first gas exports to Southeast Asia. Over nearly two decades, China has been using LNG containers to supply end users outside the pipeline system, provide emergency peak shaving, and most recently import small volumes from the international market. However, with moderating domestic demand growth, a new model has emerged: using ISO containers to divert surplus gas out of China. China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), who supplied the gas for this first shipment, sent the ISO tanks from its Fangchenggang transfer terminal in Guangxi province to Sihanoukville, Cambodia. The company is well-positioned to access the Southeast Asian market via its terminals along Southern Chinese coast and had previously planned for a ""South-to-North"" gas supply program in the domestic market.",CEO,en,IHS Markit
