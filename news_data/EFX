Yi Lee signed a deal with Solar City in 2014 to put solar panels on his Rowland Heights, California home, he said in a lawsuit filed in federal court on Tuesday. He did not purchase the panels outright from Solar City, which was acquired by Tesla in 2016 . Instead, he used a common ""power purchase agreement,"" in which the company maintains ownership of the system and sells the electricity to Lee for a pre-set rate. ""This is not a loan,"" he said in the complaint, adding that he ""chose this type of arrangement to ensure that the solar system would not reflect on his debt to income ratio, or report on his credit report as he manages these carefully."" But, much like a previous suit filed in October by another customer, Lee said he unexpectedly discovered a 20-year loan totaling near $80,000 had appeared on his credit report in September.",EFX,en,Business Insider

Of note, neither candidate has announced specific fintech plans, but we can infer a lot from their distinct politics. We think Biden would focus on consumer protection and increasing regulatory oversight, while President Trump would continue to dismantle financial regulation. While financial regulation loosened under the Trump administration, Biden seems set to strengthen oversight and launch new initiatives for financial inclusion. President Trump has eased financial regulation over the last four years, and will likely continue to do so if re-elected. For example, under the current administration, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau stripped a key provision for payday lenders, meaning they no longer have to check whether consumers have the ability to repay a loan. A Biden administration would likely try to rescind or rewrite those rules, as the former vice president previously stated that the decision ""to loosen restrictions against predatory behavior by payday lenders is shameful by itself."" Biden has also called for the creation of a public credit reporting agency competing against the likes of Equifax and TransUnion.",EFX,en,Business Insider

2020-07-31 01:31:17-05:00,How CIBIL Score and CIBIL report differ,"The credit score is an important metric used by lenders to evaluate a potential borrower's creditworthiness. TransUnion CIBIL is one of four credit rating agencies in India. Other bureaus include Experian, CRIF High Mark and Equifax A borrower's CIBIL Score is based on details found in the 'Accounts' and 'Enquiries' sections of that individual's CIBIL Report. Lenders consider both the CIBIL Score and Report to assess a person's loan eligibility.Here is a look at the difference between CIBIL Score and CIBIL Report, as per details available on the CIBIL website.What is CIBIL Score? The CIBIL score is a three-digit numeric summary of a consumer's credit history and a reflection of the person's credit profile. The CIBIL Score ranges between 300 and 900. The closer a person's CIBIL Score is to 900, the higher are the chances of the person's credit card or loan application getting approved. According to the CIBIL website, any score greater than 750 is a good CIBIL Score and helps lenders in assessing and approving your loan application. (Because this para is getting repeated in all the credit score stories -try to make the sentences slightly different from each other-Tania can help in rewriting these---even changing or adding one word -like I have added 'person's' helps.)Also read: What is CIBIL Score?The CIBIL Score is derived using the credit history found in the CIBIL Report or the Credit Information Report.",EFX,en,Economic Times India

2020-07-28 01:58:03-05:00,How is credit score calculated?,"Having a good credit score gives you leverage while applying for a loan as it assures the lender of your creditworthiness. A credit bureau (such as TransUnion CIBIL, Experian, CRIF High Mark and Equifax) will consolidate your past credit history and repayment behaviour and will provide a comprehensive report to lenders. A credit score typically ranges between 300 and 900, with 900 being the highest score possible. A higher score makes you more creditworthy and vice versa. Typically, a score of around 750 or above is considered ideal to get your loan application approved by a lender such as a bank.Here are five factors that play an important role in the calculation of one's credit score.1. Your repayment historyYour repayment history influences your credit score the most. A credit bureau keeps a month-on-month record of your payments towards your bills and loan repayment equated monthly instalments (EMIs) for the past few years.

You should never charge anywhere near your spending limit on your cards; ideally, you'll keep your utilization ratio under 30%.

2020-03-02 12:53:27-05:00,How to remove a hard inquiry from your credit report,"A hard inquiry won't damage your credit score badly, but it will knock it down a few points. You get a hard inquiry on your credit report every time you apply for a credit card or loan, such as a mortgage or auto loan. You can't remove a hard inquiry unless it's fraudulent.

But each credit card application triggers something called a ""hard inquiry,"" which can hurt your score. What is a hard credit inquiry and how does it affect your credit score? When you apply for a credit card, loan, mortgage, or any other type of financing, a credit check is almost always performed by the lender, typically a bank or credit card company.",EFX,en,Business Insider

Although awareness about the importance of good credit reports for future borrowing has been rising, but instances of motivated non-repayment are galore and this is being felt badly in Assam as well as parts of Karnataka.About 32 lenders in the sector have started submitting data daily to Cibil, Equifax and CRIF High Mark, people familiar with the matter said. The credit bureaus had to upgrade their infrastructure to upload the additional data and to update them on a daily basis.Microfinance Institutions Network (MFIN), the self-regulator for the sector, is telling all its members to follow this practice to put a check on default as the repayment trouble brews in several states“The access to daily data will empower the lenders to take business calls with better clarity,” said HP Singh, chairman at Sating Creditcare, the second largest NBFC-MFI.As regards the daily submission, lenders are now feeding in incremental data on repayment update, loan disbursement, delinquencies and any other changes in the account status.“This will also help contain multiple lending to borrowers as earlier lenders did not always have real-time view of the total leverage of the borrower as the data to the credit bureau used to be refreshed in 7 to 30 days,” said MFIN chief executive Harsh Shrivastava.MFIN said that bigger NBFC-MFIs such as CreditAccess Grameen, Fusion Microfinance and Arohan Microfinance have moved to the new reporting system.",EFX,en,The Economic Times India

Modak, a micro-credit veteran, blames banks and NBFCs for starting this trend.While the spread of banks and NBFCs into smaller towns and villages is aiding ‘financial inclusion’, it has tripped the operational matrices of mid- and small-sized microfinance institutions (MFIs). Conventional lenders like Modak are befuddled when daily-wage earners - whose monthly earnings may not be more than Rs 15,000 – approach them for loans as high as Rs 3 lakh.“I turn them down, saying you’re taking too much debt… they simply walk off to the nearest bank or NBFC branch to get that money. It has become extremely difficult to operate in such conditions,” he says.The deep dive of large institutional lenders to touch the ‘bottom of the pyramid’ has thrown up undesirable outcomes for MFIs – mainly in the form of a significant drop in ‘collection rates’, marginal hike in delinquencies and a palpable rise in rural indebtedness.",EFX,en,The Economic Times India

According to a report by Tech Crunch, this is a regular thing for the FBI. The government agency regularly uses these legal powers (known as national security letters) to compel credit giants to turn over non-content information, such as records of purchases and locations, that the agency deems necessary in national security investigations. But these letters have no judicial oversight and are typically filed with a gag order, preventing the recipient from disclosing the demand to anyone else; including the target of the letter. Since the law changed (lawmakers changed it to protect themselves and the government at large) in 2015 in the wake of the Edward Snowden disclosures that revealed the scope of the U.S. government’s surveillance operations, recipients have been allowed to petition the FBI to be cut loose from the gag provisions and publish the letters with redactions.",EFX,en,Zero Hedge
