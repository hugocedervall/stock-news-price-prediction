Joe Femenia, the head of distressed-debt trading at Jefferies Financial Group, is the man who was outlined in court filings as having taped conversations that brought the hedge fund down , according to Bloomberg . The fund fell after Kamensky urged Femenia to not submit a bid for part of bankrupt retailer Neiman Marcus. Jefferies and Marble Ridge had been involved in a standoff regarding Neiman Marcus, as they both sought to bid for a portion of the company's online business, MyTheresa. Femenia sounded the alarm on the dubious tactic and raised the issue with a U.S. trustee. Highlighting the issue forced Kamensky to acknowledge he had committed a ""grave mistake"" and forced him to ultimately shut down his fund.
