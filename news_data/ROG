With at-home tests, people self-collect their samples and send them back to the testing company for analysis. Several companies are developing tests that can work fully at home without shipping and lab equipment involved, but they haven't received the FDA's go-ahead yet. Still, ordering a test from the comfort of home can be appealing. It not only avoids run-ins with the physical healthcare system, saving time, but also reduces the risk of spreading the virus or getting infected yourself. Lab giant Quest Diagnostics has sold about half a million home tests, though that number includes self-collected samples taken in drive-thrus, the company told Business Insider in October.

The drug is called AT-527 and it’s currently in Phase 2 testing, with the final stage of clinical trials set for the first half of 2021. This new medicine is supposed to block the replication of the coronavirus inside the cell and prevent its ability to spread in the human body. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) formally approved Gilead Sciences’ Veklury (remdesivir) as the first treatment for COVID-19 on Thursday. The drug proved in clinical trials that it could help patients recover faster than traditional care. But remdesivir will not prevent deaths, a massive study from the World Health Organization (WHO) showed. The FDA’s approval followed the emergency use authorization that remdesivir received in May. But the FDA makes it clear this is the kind of COVID-19 therapy that “should only be administered in a hospital or in a healthcare setting capable of providing acute care comparable to inpatient hospital care.” The drug is administered intravenously, and it’s not the kind of therapy that can be used in a home setting.",ROG,en,BGR

The medication is part of the health ministry’s clinical management protocol for Covid-19 under investigational therapies for patients with moderate symptoms of the illness.But difference of opinion has emerged in the national task force of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) over its inclusion after Roche said in July that the phase III COVACTA study of Actemra®/RoActemra® (tocilizumab) did not meet its primary endpoint of improved clinical status in hospitalised adult patients with severe Covid-19 associated pneumonia.“While many experts believe that tocilizumab should be dropped from the treatment protocol, there are some who believe that the drug should be made available with caveats,” a member of the ICMR task force told ET on condition of anonymity. “Hence, the discussion has not concluded.” The meeting was held last week.Investigational therapies are those with limited available evidence for “off-label” use and included in the standard protocol after an expert committee approves it.“Many cited the literature which did not show any remarkable results, with many studies showing no benefit from the drug,” said another member, adding that some in the task force believe that the drug has the potential to benefit a certain subgroup of patients if given at the right time.“The studies cited by them suggest that the drug shortens the time of discharge without any increase in adverse effects.",ROG,en,Economic Times India

Swiss giant Roche Holding AG is following up with its own version.Antibodies are markers of infection, and testing for them helps health officials see how widely the virus has spread. Until now, most tests could tell only whether they’re present. The newer ones go a step further, measuring the quantity of these proteins, which are raised by the immune system to disable viral invaders.The level of the body’s response is important in determining whether patients will develop immunity. It’s also key to determining the effectiveness of vaccines as developers bring promising candidates into late-stage trials.“You need a test that shows whether a vaccine has triggered the right level of antibodies in a patient’s blood,” said Deepak Nath, president of laboratory diagnostics at Healthineers. “It’s important to say how much of it you have.”Vaccine TrialsModerna Inc. used a form of quantitative testing to show that all 45 participants in a phase I trial of its experimental coronavirus vaccine developed antibodies.",ROG,en,Economic Times India

2020-07-27 05:04:07-05:00,The U.S. has more COVID-19 testing than most. So why is it falling so short?,"By Allison Martell and Ned Parker (Reuters) - The United States might have more COVID-19 testing capacity than any other country. So why have we seen laboratories overwhelmed and many patients again waiting a week or more for results? At the heart of the crisis is a reliance by public and private labs on automated testing equipment that locks them in to using proprietary chemical kits and other tools made by a handful of manufacturers. The result: as infection rates spike nationwide, many labs aren't running anywhere near capacity because of supply-chain bottlenecks, according to Reuters interviews with 16 hospital, state, commercial and academic labs and an analysis of state and city procurement plans. A few companies – Cepheid, Hologic Inc, Roche and Abbott Laboratories – dominate this market. Their machines run on chemical kits and disposable plastic parts like sample plates and pipettes that only they sell, much like branded printer cartridges. The vendors are in an impossible situation right now where they can't say yes to everyone, said Geoffrey Baird, who runs the medical laboratory at the University of Washington.",ROG,en,Swiss Info

A new class of medicine — digital therapeutics (DTx) — has emerged, offering a novel means of treating the swelling number of patients with chronic diseases and keeping associated costs down. Digital therapeutics deliver evidence-based therapies via software — often in the form of consumer-facing mobile health apps — that replace or complement the existing treatment of a disease. They diverge from the broader digital health market in that they must be approved by regulatory bodies — and displaying proof-of-concept is at the core of their model.

In January 2019, Apple lowered its revenue guidance to $84 billion for the first quarter of its 2019 fiscal year, down from its original forecast of $89 billion to $93 billion. In a letter to shareholders, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that lower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounted for the entire revenue shortfall. On an earnings call in November 2018 , a few months earlier, Cook touted the ""very successful launch of iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max"" and also noted that iPhone demand in China was particularly strong during the fourth quarter of its 2018 fiscal year. Apple made no mention of potential iPhone or China weakness on the horizon. In her order, however, judge Rogers wrote that ""absent some natural disaster or other intervening reason, it is simply implausible that Cook would not have known that iPhone demand in China was falling mere days before cutting production lines,"" likely referring to a Wall Street Journal report that claimed Apple slashed production orders for the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR just days after its earnings call.

Blue Orca Capital’s Soren Aandahl questioned Anta Sports Products Ltd.’s accounting and corporate governance, saying its Hong Kong-listed stock may fall as much as 34 per cent. His blistering attack sent Anta down as much as 13 per cent within minutes. It rebounded on Friday, up as much as 6 per cent.Even China specialist Tongshu Wang, the founder of long-short fund WT Asset Management, noticed the lack of China selections.“Today it seems like the China topic is not that hot, and it’s a real challenge,’’ said Wang, who was the second-to-last presenter.Wang did however stand by the opportunities coming out of his country, saying China will be “the best alpha market in the world for the next five to 10 years.” He settled on Pinduoduo Inc. for his pick, because of its growth potential as e-commerce takes off.Instead, the conference was dominated by bullish calls on Japanese oil refiners and Indian banks, and some other savage short bets, including one on Casio Computer Co., which Interlink Asia Pacific Fund Chief Investment Officer Sean Debow said was fading into insignificance as consumers shift to smartwatches.Here’s a selection of other notable calls:No WrinklesRenowned short-seller Gabriel Grego from Quintessential Capital Management had a surprise in store with his long call on Botox maker Allergan Plc.",ROG,en,The Economic Times India

He warned that the world was missing the small signs, similar to earlier times, and these troubles could snowball into a crisis. Edited excerpts:You had been shorting India in 2015 I believe and you were not invested in India. Since then, have you invested in India of late or what is the case?

2019-03-22 06:44:40-05:00,Biogen stock downgraded to neutral from buy at UBS,"Analysts at UBS on Friday downgraded shares of Biogen Inc. to neutral from buy, while cutting their price target on the stock to $242 from $395. ""The failure of aducanumab leaves Biogen with a lack of visibility around a path back to top-line growth, and increasingly present threats to the base-business that investors had been willing to look past given the promise of Alzheimer's,"" analysts led by Carter Gould wrote. He cited competition to spinal muscular atrophy drug Spinraza from Roche Holding's ridiplam and threats to a 2028 patent on the company's multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera, which is under review by trademark officials after competitor Mylan N.V. filed a patent challenge in July. Biogen's stock, which fell 1.5% in premarket trade Friday, plunged 29% on Thursday after the company announced it would be discontinuing Phase 3 trials for aducanumab, its much-hyped Alzheimer's drug. Shares of the drugmaker have fallen 25% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 has gained 13.9%.
