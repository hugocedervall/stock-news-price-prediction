[USA], April 20 (ANI): China has become a threat to the world due to its Communist leaders who are promoting a closed, authoritarian model as an alternative to other democratic governments and free-market economies, H. R. McMaster, former United States National Security Advisor (NSA), wrote in an article for The Atlantic. Since the days of Deng Xiaoping, in the late 1970s, the assumptions that had governed the American approach to its relationship with China were that the mainland would open its markets and privatize its economy after being welcomed into the international political and economic order. As the country became more prosperous, the Chinese government would respect the rights of its people and liberalize politically. But, McMaster, who served under US President Donald Trump until 2018, said in the article that those assumptions were also proven wrong. The Chinese Communist Party is not only strengthening an internal system that stifles human freedom and extends its authoritarian control; it is also exporting that model and leading the development of new rules and a new international order that would make the world less free and less safe, the former US official wrote.",NSA,en,Sify.com

When Will It End And What Will Happen Along The Way Authored by Phillip Giraldi via The Strategic Culture Foundation, The coronavirus story has generated a number of major subplots… First is the origin of the virus. Did it occur naturally or was it created in a Chinese, American or Israeli weapons lab? If bioengineered, did it somehow escape or was it deliberately released? As the governments that might have been involved in the process have become very tight lipped and the mainstream media is reluctant to embrace conspiracy theories, we the public may never know the answer. Second is the nature of the virus itself. There are inevitably skeptics who choose to compare the affliction to a common head cold or normal winter flu and are able to cherry pick so-called experts to support their case. Many Americans are unwilling to submit to a lockdown or isolation and are flaunting their willingness to go out in public and mix freely while others are claiming that the whole thing is a hoax designed to create a panic that will benefit certain constituencies.",NSA,en,Zero Hedge
