The crisis forced many to temporarily close and has caused drops in demand as consumers deal with financial difficulties and follow social distancing guidelines. The sudden drop in earnings, which may continue if pandemic conditions don't improve soon, could lead to wide-scale small-business closures in the coming months, and medium-sized businesses may be facing similar risks since the prolonged nature of the crisis is likely cutting into any additional resources and funds they have access to. By helping SMBs survive the crisis, point-of-sale (POS) solution providers will preserve their client bases and strengthen their appeal to prospective customers.

And even as dining has reopened nationwide, ongoing capacity restrictions and consumer wariness have kept customers home and left engagement down by double digits. As restaurants continue to struggle to earn revenues, they've been forced to adapt their operations in order to keep their doors open. Implementing digital technology has become the core tool restaurants are using to stay afloat. The sector was already on the rise prior to the pandemic, especially at quick-service restaurants (QSRs): We expected mobile order-ahead annual sales volume would hit $31 billion this year. But the pandemic pushed restaurants to expand their usage of the technology for pickup, delivery, and even in-person dining, bringing penetration to levels not expected until 2023.

Within the past year, the price of Bitcoin has more than doubled, posting close to $10,000 in growth in the last two months alone. As Ethan Yang writes at The American Institute for Economic Research , with most of the news attention on Covid-19, the presidential election, and so on, it is understandable that the meteoric rise of Bitcoin may have slipped past casual observers as it did not receive the attention it received in 2017.

In 2017, when the price of Bitcoin hit an all-time high at $20,000, the retail demand was at its peak. Google Trends data soared, mainstream media coverage noticeably increased, and spot exchange volumes exploded across major markets, especially in South Korea and Japan. This time, the Google Trends interest is relatively low for the keyword “Bitcoin” while on-chain data shows smart money is accumulating BTC.",SQ,en,Zero Hedge

This comes after Square's seller GPV fell on an annual basis in Q2 2020 , leading its total GPV to plunge 15% YoY because the coronavirus pandemic damaged its merchants' businesses. The recovery of Square's seller business is partially due to the easing of government restrictions that limited traffic and merchants' operations in response to the pandemic, CFO Amrita Ahuja said on the company's earnings call , so Square's performance could continue to rise and fall when conditions improve or deteriorate and cause changes in restrictions. Cash App's rising performance, alongside the recovery of Square's seller business, could set Square up for long-term success. The peer-to-peer payments app accelerated its already surging performance during the pandemic in Q3.

2020-11-04 09:46:00-05:00,Why US digital-only banks will keep growing in the next 5 years,"Summary List Placement In our recent Digital-Only Bank Account Holders Forecast report, Insider Intelligence discussed how—despite risks like a pandemic-battered global economy and ongoing profitability struggles—we expect account holder numbers at digital-only banks to stay on an upward trajectory between 2020 and 2024 in the US, UK, and Canada. The US, in particular, will see the highest growth rate in account holders during the forecast period, at a compound annual growth rate of 19.8%. We think the following three factors will be the most instrumental in driving account holder numbers among US digital-only banks between now and 2024: Increasingly supportive regulators. Unlicensed digital-only banks currently must partner with a sponsor bank to lend money and accept deposits—but the tide may be turning to make it easier for them to obtain a license. The Trump administration has been loosening post-2008 crisis regulations since 2016, cutting red tape for banks of all sizes. And current Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) chairperson Jelena McWilliams has said that one of her priorities is to examine the regulatory burden on small banks (including neobanks) and speed up bank charter application reviews—and it shows: Varo became the first neobank to obtain FDIC insurance in February, followed by Square in March.",SQ,en,Business Insider

2020-10-14 08:52:43-05:00,Crypto traders cautious on Bitcoin price as rally to $11.7K goes sour,"Traders are becoming cautious about Bitcoin price after repeated rejections at the $11,500 level following the recent rally. After the price of Bitcoin ( BTC ) achieved $11,720 on Binance, traders began to turn slightly skeptical on the dominant cryptocurrency. Despite the initial breakout above two key resistance levels at $11,300 and $11,500, BTC recorded several rejections. While it might be premature to predict a marketwide correction, the level of uncertainty in the market seems to be rising. In the short term, traders pinpoint the $11,200 to $11,325 range as a critical support area. If that region holds, technical analysts believe a significant price drop is unlikely. But if Bitcoin demonstrates weakening momentum below $11,300, the market would likely become vulnerable. Although the technical momentum of BTC has been declining, traders generally see a bigger support range from $10,600 to $10,900. Considering the array of positive events that buoyed the price of Bitcoin in recent weeks, a near-term pullback could be healthy.",SQ,en,Cointelegraph

Many SMBs are on the brink of closing permanently in the wake of the pandemic. The crisis forced many to temporarily close and has caused drops in demand as consumers deal with financial difficulties and follow social distancing guidelines. The sudden drop in earnings, which may continue if pandemic conditions don't improve soon, could lead to wide-scale small-business closures in the coming months, and medium-sized businesses may be facing similar risks since the prolonged nature of the crisis is likely cutting into any additional resources and funds they have access to. By helping SMBs survive the crisis, point-of-sale (POS) solution providers will preserve their client bases and strengthen their appeal to prospective customers. Many SMBs already had some form of POS system in order to accept payments.

2020-10-01 13:40:24-05:00,A federal banking regulator wants to bring fintechs under its purview. Here's what that means for the red-hot payments space — and why big banks are worried.,"Summary List Placement Over the past decade, fintechs have become more than a niche group of disruptive startups out of Silicon Valley. Today, fintechs like Stripe and Square have achieved massive scale — and valuations — and are an essential part of the financial-services industry. But most fintechs aren't licensed banks, meaning they don't have a banking charter issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), one of the key regulators overseeing consumer banking. Instead, they are regulated and licensed at the state level, which means to operate nationally they have to work with 50 different regulatory bodies. That could soon change, however, as the OCC is mulling a charter aimed specifically at fintechs that process payments, allowing them to be regulated at a national level. As a result, payments fintechs would be able to sidestep state-by-state regulation. The charter would be a national version of a state money transmission license, which fintechs currently have to apply for in each state they operate in.",SQ,en,Business Insider

The new feature also integrates with Square's online payment system, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. Square has added new digital offerings amid the pandemic to appeal to restaurants and boost its revenues. For example, Square introduced on-demand delivery integration that allows restaurants to more seamlessly work with third-party courier services during the pandemic.

This followed a May report in which we discussed ""how retail investors took over the stock market"", pointing out the ""recent surge in options trading - which has far more impact on market flows due to embedded leverage"" and cited Goldman data which showed that "" individual investor active trading is playing an increased role in market volatility, particularly in select stocks. In the shares market, 2.3% of all volume is made up of trades for $2,000 or less. The increase in small trades has been even more notable in the options market, where 13% of all trades are for 1 contract ."" We also pointed out that ""a significant portion of this increase has been driven by higher volumes in short dated contracts , as investors are literally using massive leverage to wager on near-term momentum moves such as those often highlighted OTM calls traded in Tesla stock."" The last clue that an entire generation of investors were flooding into options - read calls - was the surge in individual investor option activity in both the top 50 and the top 500 US names, which has continued a steady climb since the start of the year (with a larger recent increase in the proportion of volume among the top 50.) To be sure, this option frenzy was a goldmine for retail brokerages such as Robinhood, Schwab and Etrade, which reported options trading activity surging 129% YTD (up 35% from June levels), which helped explain why various HFT outfits are paying so much to frontrun Robinhood option trades.",SQ,en,Zero Hedge

The iteration reduces to seconds the time it takes financial data to reach a fintech from a financial institution (FI). Exchange helps banks build their own APIs that tie into Plaid's established network of fintechs, such as Venmo, Robinhood, Coinbase, and Square's Cash App. This iteration of Plaid Exchange makes it more efficient for banks to output and fintechs to access that data. The Exchange model is as much about giving FIs control as helping fintechs utilize customer-permissioned data. Banks and other financial companies have been wary of sharing customer-permissioned data with fintechs. Exchange is attractive to FIs because, by building APIs in-house, they can better control the flow of customers' financial data to fintechs. The original Plaid API and its competitors depend on screen scraping, which FIs consider a threat to data security and customer privacy.",SQ,en,Business Insider
