2020-11-11 12:36:39.000,US utilities follow a “shift to safety” strategy,"In recent years, many US utilities have begun to follow a ""shift to safety"" strategy by rapidly shifting shares of capital spending away from competitive ventures and toward safer, state-regulated utility projects. Between 2016 and 2019, capital spending on state-regulated utility projects increased 10.5% per year, while utility capital spending on nonutility projects fell 6.5% per year (see Figure 1). The trend toward safety is likely to continue, as major announcements in 2020 from Avangrid (PNM Resources acquisition), DTE Energy (plans to spin-off midstream natural gas business) and PSEG (plans to divest nonnuclear competitive generation) all reflect an increase in strategic emphasis on regulated electric and gas utility operations.

Duke’s 2020 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), filed Tuesday with state regulators, lays out six scenarios for reaching its challenging goals of halving its emissions by 2030 and hitting net-zero carbon by 2050 . All of the scenarios go well beyond Duke’s previous IRPs in leaning more heavily on solar, onshore wind and energy storage. The utility has also opened the door to offshore wind in its future mix. Duke has already committed to doubling its 8 gigawatts of renewables by 2025 and to retiring its roughly 10,000 megawatts of coal generation by 2030. But that's about where the similarities stop. The six options Duke is presenting to North Carolina and South Carolina regulators take notably different routes for adding 4,600 megawatts of new resources to its current 23,200-megawatt generation fleet in the states.",AGR,en,Green Technology Media

Last year wind overtook hydropower in total generation, and 2020 is on track to be a record year for new wind farm construction. But all other energy sources are losing ground to solar these days, wind included. Solar accounted for 40 percent of new U.S. generation capacity in 2019, its largest share in history. After 2020 its lead over wind will widen rapidly, according to Wood Mackenzie's forecast. Large-scale solar is already cost competitive with wind in many states, and analysts believe solar has an easier path toward further cost reductions . In Texas, home to nearly a third of the country’s 100 gigawatts of wind capacity, there’s now more solar than wind in the interconnection queue.

2020-05-13 14:51:00.000,Renewable Yieldcos Take on New Light After Global Energy Shakeup,"U.S.-listed renewable energy yieldcos have fallen in and out fashion since they burst onto the markets early last decade. Where do they stand today as investors reassess the energy landscape in a post-coronavirus world? Leading yieldcos like NextEra Energy Partners, Terraform Power and Atlantica Yield all saw rapid rises in their share prices in late 2019 and early 2020. The surge came after years of lackluster performance that followed the initial yieldco boom and then bust of the mid-2010s. Yieldcos focus on the relatively low-risk business of operating wind farms, solar arrays and other clean-energy assets, and typically offer investors a generous dividend. The recent revived interest in yieldcos may have been driven by jitters over the outlook of other energy stocks, and particularly those related to fossil fuels. The main period of yieldco growth coincided with a quickening in the pace of renewables acquisitions by oil majors. In some cases, U.S. yieldco stock prices in February 2020 were the highest seen since the market's heyday in the summer of 2015.",AGR,en,Green Technology (Feed)

Utilities across the country are reporting dramatic drops in commercial and industrial energy demand.
