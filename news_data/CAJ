In the past year, every major brand—including Nikon, Panasonic, and Canon—has jumped on board. The Fujifilm X-T3 ($1,399), released in September, combines an innovative autofocus and top-of-the-line color reproduction with an analog design that harks back to the days of Henri Cartier-Bresson. It even has a “film” setting that’ll apply old-school filters to pictures. The Competition • Nikon Corp. has a dedicated fan base and beloved family of camera lenses. In November it rolled out the Z6 ($1,999 for the body only), the first of two digital mirrorless cameras. At just 585 grams (1.3 pounds) it’s the lightest option on this list. • Sony Corp. has been playing the full-frame mirrorless game for longer than most, and its Alpha7 III ($1,999 for the body only) offers a solid 24.2-megapixel option, a 693-point autofocus system, and one of the longest-lasting batteries available. • Canon Inc.’s first mirrorless camera, the $2,299 EOS R (body only), has a high megapixel count, 30.3, and also provides superb video quality for those looking for a full-frame camera that doesn’t trade size for strength.",CAJ,en,Bloomberg
