2020-08-16 07:10:00-05:00,Joe Biden officially accepts the Democratic nomination this week. RBC says buy these 47 stocks spanning every industry that are poised to crush the market if he wins in a wave election.,"RBC's stock analysts are decidedly bearish on the prospect of a Joe Biden presidency, but they're still naming the most promising stocks in every industry represented on the S&P 500. Lori Calvasina, the head of US equity strategy, says those analysts think Biden and a fully Democratic government would be good news for utilities and some healthcare sectors, but not many others. Their ideas could help investors target the companies with the most to gain and limit their downside if the prospect of higher taxes weighs on markets.

The former vice president is scheduled to accept the Democratic nomination on Thursday. ""Our analysts see Biden as a bullish outcome for Utilities â€¦ and a bearish outcome for Energy, Consumer Discretionary, Industrials and Financials,"" she wrote in a note to clients.","WMT,WRB",en,Business Insider
2020-08-02 19:46:15-05:00,Tech Stock Buybacks Are Surging,"Tech Stock Buybacks Are Surging Tyler Durden Sun, 08/02/2020 - 20:46 Two months ago, we showed that contrary to conventional wisdom and corporate reps and warrants that buybacks had effectively been put on hold for the duration of the covid pandemic, not only were companies still repurchasing their shares but it was the tech names - those who have stormed higher since the March lows - that were the biggest culprits. Now, two months after we first revealed Wall Street's worst kept secret, the Financial Times has also noticed that Corporate America is finding it hard to kick the share buyback habit, even after the US slipped into its worst recession in decades. While total buybacks are indeed expected to drop this year as the downturn caused by coronavirus saps corporate profits, companies in the S&P 500 that have reported second-quarter earnings so far have reduced the number of their outstanding shares by an average of 0.3 per cent from the previous quarter, according to calculations from Credit Suisse.",WRB,en,Zero Hedge
