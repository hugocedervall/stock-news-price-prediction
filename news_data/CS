An immense bronze statue of modern Switzerland’s founding father stands, fittingly, in front of Zurich’s main train station. Escher was a politician, but he was also an entrepreneur who founded the country’s railway network along with the its leading university and the banking giant Credit Suisse. The statue in Zurich has memorialised Escher for more than 100 years, but it may not be there for much longer.

A Credit Suisse equity research team led by analysts Andrew St. Pierre and Arbin Sherchan is using a calculated, hard-numbers approach to find companies that can do both. They've assembled a list of ""Outperform""-rated stocks that they say represent the firm's highest-conviction ideas, and that are underappreciated by others. The analysts assessed Credit Suisse's own conviction levels by comparing both the second-year earnings estimates and rolling 12-month price targets to the Wall Street consensus. They reasoned that when the firm's estimates diverged from consensus, that represented greater conviction. The other major component in their work involved identifying companies where other analysts have very low expectations, which makes it easier for the companies to exceed them, setting off a rally in their stocks.",CS,en,Business Insider

Simon Bond, who manages social bond funds at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, says that “it has been a long time coming” but that this step offers “tangible evidence” that the UK is “walking the walk, not just talking the talk” when it comes to green finance, as it is due to host a United Nations’ climate summit next year. Columbia Threadneedle Investments manages GBP24.5 billion in responsible investment assets and has been advocating the issuance of UK gilts with specific use of proceeds since early last year. “Green gilts have the potential to scale up the UK’s drive to a net-zero carbon economy and reinforce its reputation as a centre for financial innovation.",CS,en,InstitutionAlassetManager

Covid-19 has obviously taken center stage and the year is drawing to a close with a new President-elect after a dramatic Joe Biden win in the U.S presidential election.But 2020 has also provided a number of interesting sub-stories. One of which has been the rise of electric vehicles (EVs). Investors have warmed to the theme by sending several companies’ valuations sky high.Chinese new energy vehicle (NEV) maker XPeng (XPEV) joined the fray toward the end of the summer and is already making waves. The stock began a parabolic move at the end of October and shares are up by 80% since the end of last month.But Xpeng is riding a duel trend. In the near-term, the focus has been on new energy vehicles, but deeper into the decade, autonomous vehicles are expected to play a much larger role. And XPeng excels in this department, according to J.P. Morgan analyst Nick Lai. The analyst calls XPeng an “EV start-up with a strategic focus on in-house ADAS/autonomous driving solutions and differentiated platform strategy vs. peers.” Lai sees XPeng as a major beneficiary of “China’s multi-year smart-EV trend,” and expects penetration to increase threefold “from less than 5% in 2019 toward 13% or higher by 2025.”“We see the global auto industry structurally trending toward greener (NEVs) and smarter (autonomous/connectivity) vehicles,” Lai further said. “Companies like XPeng that can deliver Smart EV offerings should benefit most, in our view.”To this end, Lai reiterates a Buy rating on XPEV shares, while raising the price target from $27 to $43.",CS,en,Yahoo Finance

Instead, it started with a relative newcomer to his inner circle, a former Deutsche Bank AG trader with a background in financial engineering.Akshay Naheta, not yet 40, has worked on some of SoftBank Group Corp.’s biggest deals since joining the company three years ago. Some, like a $1 billion debt transaction with Wirecard AG, have been controversial. But they got him close enough to Son that he was able to pitch him on the sale of Arm to semiconductor designer Nvidia Corp.Naheta’s rise at SoftBank -- he’s now a senior vice president, providing strategic advice to Son -- reflects the company’s move away from running technology businesses to an investment-holdings model where finance veterans with an appetite for risk and complexity hold sway.

Credit Suisse On Xilinx Deal, AMD's Q3: The per-share deal value of $143 represents a 25% premium as opposed to the 30% median premium for the semiconductor industry, Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer said in a note. The combined company on a trailing 12-month basis would have had revenues of $11.6 billion, gross margins of 51%, operating margins of 21% and free cash flow of $1.8 billion, the analyst said, citing the company. This compares to AMD's standalone gross margins of 45%, operating margins of 17% and free cash flow of $154 million, he said. The deal boosts AMD's total addressable market from $80 billion to $110 billion, Pitzer said.

A corporate espionage saga that was launched by UBS's strategic poaching of a top Credit Suisse banker led to the ouster back in February of Tidjane Thiam, CS's former CEO. So as megabanks around the world prepare to cut bonuses for their top traders and bankers once again despite a surge in IB profits, UBS has engineered a cunning new compensation plan that will effectively trick its top workers into thinking they're getting paid more, while actually paying them less. According to Bloomberg, the scheme will entail changes to the ""compensation structure"", essentially slashing bonuses while upping their base pay. For some managers, base pay could climb by 20%. Plus, lowering attrition will also allow the bank to cut down on costs associated with spying on its most productive employees.",CS,en,Zero Hedge

2020-10-24 05:00:00-05:00,Bank of America says these are the 22 European value stocks to own — and 6 traps to avoid — given the 10% upside potential for value stocks by early next year,"Summary List Placement Value stocks have had their worst year since 1992, falling by 38% adjusting for sector bias, according to Bank of America quant strategists in a research note released on October 20. But equity analysts and quant strategists at the bank are expecting that to change going forward as obstacles for value outperformance begin to fade. ""European value versus growth has yet to price in the macro recovery,"" Bank of America equity analyst, Sebastian Raedler, said in the note. Raedler identifies two obstacles in the way of value outperformance. Firstly, bond yields have not risen meaningfully in response to improving economic macro data. Secondly, two of the big European value sectors have continued to underperform —energy and financials. He expects with a maturing economic recovery this will translate to rising bond yields and an improving earnings cycle for these lagging sectors. The removal of these obstacles should translate to a 10% upside for value versus growth stocks by the first quarter of next year, Raedler said. ""[Bank of America quant strategists] argue that the cyclical reasons for owning value have strengthened: (a) their Style Cycle and US & EM regional indicators point to a synchronized pick-up; (b) EPS Revision Ratio for value stocks is the strongest since 2018; and (c) 90% of Fund Managers expect a vaccine in place by H1 next year, which should help to lift bond yields,"" Raedler said.",CS,en,Business Insider

Just as the Federal Open Market Committee never speaks about foreign anything when discussing interest rate policy, so too most observers largely ignore the offshore markets. Yen, dollar and euro LIBOR spreads are shown below. Zoltan Pozsar , the influential money-market strategist at Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) , warns that the short-end of the US money markets are likely to be awash in cash over the end-of-year liquidity hump. Unlike the unpleasantness in 2018, for example, we may see instead a surfeit of lending as banks scramble for yield in a wasteland bereft of duration. Would that it were so.

The veteran investor shares 3 stocks he's betting on, and the pandemic-related opportunities he's seizing.","Summary List Placement David Herro has seen it all during his 35-year investing career. For 28 years, he has been at the helm of the $22.2 billion Oakmark International fund, a gold-rated Morningstar fund despite its almost 18% slump in performance year-to-date. The gold ratings are only reserved for funds that Morningstar analysts ""have the most conviction will outperform a relevant index, or most peers, over a market cycle,"" according to its website. Since its inception in 1992, the Oakmark International fund has had five such ""bumps in the road"" which include the 1994 bond market crisis, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 recession now, Herro said. ""Every one of those bumps, we've recovered quite strong. They become the fuel, the opportunity,"" he told Business Insider. ""When stocks get pushed to unrealistic levels, they tend to come back quite strongly following a big bump. I think investors should look at it more as an opportunity than anything else."" Where Herro is finding opportunities amid COVID-19 The pandemic has inflicted a lot of damage, but it has also created ""a huge opportunity"" for Herro to pick up bargains — businesses that have been beaten down by the COVID-ravaged economy but are poised to bounce back because of their strong fundamentals.

""As a result of the pandemic, what was inevitable over the next decade is probably going to happen over the next two or three years.""

The alarm was raised by research groups Amazon Watch and Stand.earth, who called oil extraction in the region “a gateway to deforestation and increased agricultural and industrial activity”. The banks that were reported to have backed the oil trade were accused of double standards, as all had made public environmental commitments, such as to the 2015 Paris climate accord, the United Nations sustainable development goals, and promises to protect forests. In the aftermath of the report, Swiss bank UBS and Netherlands-based Rabobank scrambled to state that they had stopped financing Amazonian oil, either wholly or in part, and Natixis and ING issued hasty pledges to “look into” the report’s findings.",CS,en,InstitutionAlassetManager

The central bank also ordered a freeze on the salary of the managing director and CEO, Chandra Shekhar Ghosh.The bank has about 1,100 branches and its expansion is linked to the end to the regulatory bar.The RBI’s bank licence rules state that promoters of private banks should cut their shareholding to 40% within three years and 20% in 10 years.",CS,en,Economic Times India

For an ‘outstanding’ ESG score, banks had to have a positive score in more than 90 per cent of the criteria. Benchmark criteria included culture and governance, risk management, reporting, targets and more. The report, ‘Responsible banking practices: benchmark study 2020’, found that over half of banks sampled showed ‘limited evidence’ of a sustainable approach across most criteria. Banks were often found to focus on environmentally responsible products, but product offerings were yet to fully address socio-economic issues. Most banks have adopted or are implementing voluntary ESG reporting standards but the majority (57 per cent) have yet to fully integrate ESG factors into their Risk Management Framework using both qualitative and quantitative approaches.",CS,en,InstitutionAlassetManager

The banking reforms that started in 2015 in right earnest has achieved a lot. But a lot more needs to be done. This is probably the best time to complete the half done banking sector reforms as activity in the banking sector is at an all time low. The merger of the PSB’s is already under way. The restructuring of operations to increase efficiency and accountability in the PSB’s has however still not been done. That process is complex and will take a lot of time, but it is the real repair work without which the PSB’s will never be able to perform or deliver.

2020-07-16 12:52:57-05:00,The parent of mortgage giant Quicken Loans is prepping an IPO pitch valuing it more like a payments company than a lender. Here's why.,"Quicken Loans' parent company is readying its initial public offering and will likely price before the end of July. In terms of valuation, its closest comparable multiples could be in the payments space, not other mortgage companies or financial institutions. But because its business is more cyclical than payments, it'll likely have a slight discount to traditional payments giants. The company, citing its quiet period, declined to comment. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . After 35 years as a private firm, the parent company of mortgage giant Quicken Loans is set for a public-market debut. Rocket Companies filed paperwork earlier this month to list on the New York Stock Exchange and its initial public offering will likely price before the end of July, a person with knowledge of the process told Business Insider. The company started working on an IPO around the winter holidays of 2019, said a second source familiar with the plans.

The bank’s 2020 Mid-Year Hedge Fund Investor Survey – titled ‘Navigating Unchartered Waters’ – probed evolving allocator appetite, surveying some 160 institutional investors during May and June, collectively representing around USD450 billion in hedge fund investments globally. The wide-ranging study quizzed a broad mix of pension funds, endowments, family offices, insurers, funds of funds, advisors, consultants and more on their allocations, redemptions, and strategy appetite, among other things.

Investors in SoftBank Group Corp. may have seen a bit of both. Now, its entanglement with Wirecard AG leaves shareholders wondering exactly what kind of business they’ve been sinking their money into.Over the past year, SoftBank’s $80 billion startup splurge has quickly unraveled, as WeWork imploded and the initial public offering of Uber Technologies Inc. fell flat. But unlike WeWork, Wirecard won’t force SoftBank to write down any assets — because the tech conglomerate never put money into Wirecard itself.Instead, SoftBank facilitated a 900 million euro ($1 billion) convertible bond deal for the German digital payments company. Without requiring any SoftBank cash, the deal appeared to give the company’s stamp of approval to Wirecard, which had faced scrutiny over its accounting for years before admitting that 1.9 billion euros had gone missing from its accounts.",CS,en,Economic Times India

Last week, the FT reported that SoftBank was using a couple of Credit Suisse funds focused on a new business line: so-called supply-chain finance. But rather than simply buying accounts payables for a diverse group of companies, these funds - which happened to be advised by the Softbank-backed Greensill Capital - essentially served as a low-key route for SoftBank to pour more capital into its struggling investments.

Yes, of course, it could be. Desperate governments will take desperate actions. And as the world economy is now slumping into a hyperinflationary depression, unlimited money printing will cause currencies to collapse, leading to a surge in the gold price measured in worthless paper money. So the first question we must ask is: Why would governments punish prudent savers who have taken protection in gold against the irresponsible mismanagement of the economy and the currency? GOLD IS 0.5% OF GLOBAL ASSETS Global financial assets are estimated by Credit Suisse to be $360 trillion. Of that stocks are $85 trillion or 24%. The global bond market is $100 trillion (28%). Investment gold is around 35,000 tonnes or $1.9 trillion. This represents a mere 0.5% of global financial assets. With investment gold representing only 0.5% of global assets whilst stocks are 24%, you can ask why the US government, are doing all they can do drive up the value of stocks by printing money and at the same time suppressing the price of gold.",CS,en,Zero Hedge

Golub then counters that while ""bearish investors would (correctly) point out that future returns are highly influenced by starting valuations, with higher P/Es leading to weaker performance, as multiples de-rate toward long-term averages"", he would, in turn, respond that ""valuations have little influence over the near-term"" (the chart above makes that quite clear).",CS,en,Zero Hedge

If high profits do not attract competition, there is something wrong with the system, and it is not functioning properly.” – Jeremy Grantham At that time, the impending recession, and consumption freeze, was only starting and we had no data to suggest just how bad it was going to get. Since then, we have had epic declines in manufacturing, surging unemployment, and plunging retail sales. To wit: “From the decline of 8.7% in retail sales, 40% of PCE, we can extrapolate the decline into expectations for PCE growth. Again, since PCE comprises almost 70% of the economy, this is why expectations are for a drop of 10%, or more, in GDP in the second quarter.” But it isn’t just retail sales.",CS,en,Zero Hedge

The cut is about 4 times greater than the last record, and will help stabilize the oil markets in the weeks to come. But research by leading Wall Street banks and institutions suggests the cuts will be insufficient to overcome the unprecedented demand destruction driven by the coronavirus. Storage tanks are still at risk of filling up, and oil and gas companies will have to shut in wells and lay off staff. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . A coalition of oil-producing nations known as OPEC Plus made history on Sunday when it reached a deal to curb oil supply by 9.7 million barrels per day, dwarfing all previous cuts. It was a remarkable response to a collapse in demand linked to the coronavirus pandemic, which has stunted transportation. The number of air travelers, for example, is just 5% of what it was a year ago, according to a report by Morgan Stanley on Monday.",CS,en,Business Insider

The report focused on the analysis of $1tn in corporate savings sitting in offshore accounts, held mostly by big tech firms. One important similarity of all the big tech companies is the rise of the value of intellectual property and brands, as intangible assets relative to tangible assets. The report's results showed that only 10% of those companies, the largest and the richest ones, controlled as much as 80% of this stash of an offshore $1tn. Among those companies, there are very familiar names: Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ), Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL ), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ), and others. The size seems to be the problem. The bigger the company gets, the harder and harder it becomes to control it and to regulate it.

After Wall Street’s muddled performance on Friday and US markets closed Monday for a holiday, traders turned their attention to grim economic news in the region. Japan’s economy suffered its worst quarterly contraction in more than five years, while Singapore cut its growth forecast for this year as the virus batters the city-state’s tourism and trade. That comes after Europe’s largest economy Germany on Friday reported zero growth in the last quarter of 2019. While investors are comforted by a slowdown in new infections outside hardest-hit Hubei province in recent days, they might be less sanguine if China’s economy takes a worse-than-expected hit, said Stephen Innes of AxiCorp. “If it comes out bad enough for confidence to plummet, investors could quickly find themselves up the creek… without a paddle,“ Innes said in a commentary. “Financial markets are not known for their rational thinking lately and given the 500 million or so mainlanders affected by the (COVID-19) quarantine... it’s also not hard to come up with more downside risks than upside ones right now.” A spokesman for China’s national health authority said the slowdown was a sign the outbreak was being controlled.",CS,en,The Sun Daily

Según consta en el proyecto de Presupuestos de la Generalitat para 2020, el departamento de Presidencia, que dirige Meritxell Budó (JpC), destinará 7.050.000 euros a la «promoción de medios de comunicación» privados, lo que supone un aumento del 2,5 por ciento respecto a las últimas cuentas autonómicas aprobadas, en 2017.

Ayer, en la Comisión de Asuntos Institucionales del Parlamento de Cataluña, Budó, durante la presentación de las cuentas de su Consejería (610,4 millones de euros para este año), reiteró esta idea. «Los medios privados tienen la función de cohesión social, fomento y normalización de las lenguas catalana y aranesa», señaló, tras defender que estas subvenciones estructurales se vehicularán a través de «cinco líneas»: publicaciones en papel, medios digitales, cadenas de televisión, emisoras de radio y «entidades sin ánimo de lucro».",CS,es,ABC

The environmentalists’ targets include not only private banks like Credit Suisse, but also the Swiss National Bank (SNB). The SNB has accumulated foreign exchange reserves of more than CHF800 billion ($830 billion) and is now one of the world’s leading institutional investors. It contributes to the prosperity of the Alpine nation and its inhabitants not only through its monetary policy, but also through its billion-dollar profits, part of which are paid out each year to federal and cantonal authorities. However, not everyone agrees with how the central bank generates profits. For example, more than 100,000 people have signed a people’s initiative that wants to ban the SNB and pension funds from investing in companies that produce war materiel.

Someone once told me about a film actor who had developed a powerful ecological conscience, and in this spirit he bought every cast and crew member on his latest production a reusable coffee cup. As the shoot wore on, he’d make spot checks to see if they were using them. This was a source of some irritation but more amusement to the crew, who’d observe darkly to each other that – with the best will in the world on the old coffee cup front – they were literally MAKING A MOVIE HERE. There are few more disposably indulgent, bigger footprint projects than creating a second-tier romantic comedy (unless it’s maybe failing to be able to tell the Spiderman story in less than two and three quarter hours). It’s hard not to think about such ironies as far as sport and climate change go, and it will be even harder as the Australian Open gets under way this week. Already, the current stop on the sport’s globetrotting tour has seen bushfire smoke cause qualifying games to be delayed and a player to withdraw .",CS,en,The Guardian

By year's end, the volume of deals in this so-called secondaries market will be nearly $100 billion, analysts forecast, a 35 percent increase from last year and nearly quadruple the size of the market seven years ago.

Market sentiment was dented on Tuesday evening and the Yuan slumped after Trump Trade Adviser Peter Navarro said he ""got no indication"" that the U.S. would postpone new tariffs on Chinese goods that are due to take effect on Dec. 15. Navarro’s comments conflicted with reports from the WSJ and Bloomberg that cited people familiar with the trade talks as saying Chinese officials expect President Donald Trump to delay the hike to allow more time for the reaching of an interim deal. Amid the last minute verbal brinkmanship, China's nationalist tabloid Global Times, tweeted that ""The US' brinksmanship in using tariffs as leverage to force #China into giving more ground in #tradetalks will not succeed; Instead, it could prompt a new round of tit-for-tat tariff fights, darkening an already pressured global economy and sparking global stock selloff.""

Goldman Responds To Zero Hedge Ask any Wall Street analyst why stocks are at all time highs and the immediate answer will be because adjusted corporate profits and income are similarly at or near all time highs, which means that the multiple needed to justify an S&P around 3,150 is not all that egregious ( technically it is , as DB's Binky Chadha noted last week when he pointed out that the S&P 500 is trading at a multiple that’s higher than any time since the dot-com era, except for a few months in late 2017 and early 2018. As Chadha wrote , ""the S&P 500 trailing multiple has historically mostly stayed in a range between 10x-20x. So current valuation at 19.1x is clearly at the higher end of the historical range. Indeed, over the last 85 years, outside the late 1990s equity bubble, the multiple remained below current levels around 90% of the time ."")

This handwringing is also fuelled by rapidly falling consumer demand, which, despite government reforms, could further lower GDP for the third quarter.Leaders are preparing their teams for slowdown, now that Moody’s has slashed India’s growth forecast earlier this month to 5.6% for 2019. Some are already looking to strategies like lowering prices to ride out the tough times that they believe are here.That way of thinking, however, is dead wrong. India still offers better and more exciting scenarios for growth than almost any country. With 1.4 billion people, it’s a marketer’s dream. It has a rapidly growing middle class.

That’s mainly because money supply -- including currency in circulation and bank deposits -- is too low, Neelkanth Mishra, India strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in the Business Standard newspaper.Authorities need to compress this spread to revive demand for goods and services, rather than focus on incentives to companies, Abhishek Lodha, managing director at Macrotech Developers, said in an interview last month.“No sector specific sops are needed, we all are big boys,” Lodha said. “What can be done is that we need to put money in the hands of the consumer.",CS,en,The Economic Times India

The decline in demand stems from an income growth slump in urban and rural areas that’s forced people to curb spending, falling money supply in the economy and rising uncertainty over how customers will respond to regulatory action, experts said. The next government may need to prime the pump as consumption has been one of the engines that has been driving the economy in the absence of private investment and exports.“You can’t say FMCG is recession proof but it is recession resistant,” said Hindustan Unilever chairman Sanjiv Mehta during a press briefing after March quarter results. “People don’t stop bathing or cleaning their teeth when conditions become tough.

In advanced economies around the world, the output derived from every hour of work has been declining, capping the extent to which workers have been able to contribute to growth.

2019-03-06 18:05:00-05:00,Fed Plans Tighter Liquidity Rules For Foreign Banks To Limit Reliance On Discount Window During Crisis,"Back in July 2017 , when we observed that a shocking 40% of the Fed's interest on excess reserves had been paid, inexplicably, to foreign banks and implicitly represent a subsidy to foreign banks to the tune of tens of billions each year, we said that ""we wonder if this is the main reason why the Fed is so desperate to trim its balance sheet as it hikes rates, as sooner or later, someone in Congress will figure this out."" As a tangent we said that ""considering that cash at US banks, most of which is parked at the Fed as reserves, amounts to just under $1.5 trillion, we wonder why the Fed does not simply cut off foreign banks' eligibility for its generous IOER subsidy, and make its balance sheet eligible only to US banks. It would slash its bloated balance sheet by over $800 billion overnight. Oh yes, that may actually test the widely accepted theory that banks outside the US are ""safe."" Almost two years later, while the Fed has yet to move on curbing foreign bank subsidies courtesy of IOER, the US central bank is finally considering stricter rules on foreign bank branches to tighten what critics say is a loophole that has allowed overseas lenders to shield assets from the toughest U.S. bank rules , while collecting billions in annual hand outs courtesy of reserves parked with the Fed.",CS,en,Zero Hedge

2019-03-06 14:30:02-05:00,One Bank Spots The Biggest Market Divergence In 70 Years,"The market's infatuation with punishing value stocks while bidding up the shittiest growth names has hit historic proportions. According to Bernstein quants, the valuation divergence between the cheapest and priciest companies has reached a level never seen before in nearly 70 years of market observations, prompting the firm to urge clients to fade the extreme divergence between ""cheap"" and ""expensive"" stocks: "" Valuation spreads in the U.S. are close to all-time wide levels compared to the past 70 years ,"" Bernstein's Inigo Fraser-Jenkins wrote, adding that ""they are also wide in other regions. This provides a support for value within the market contrasted with traditional asset classes which are mostly fully valued."" Factoring easier financial conditions and the coming rebound in European and Asian economies sets the stage for a long-overdue outperformance in value stocks over the next 6 to 12 months, the firm predicts. As Bloomberg observes , the call is at odds with value bears at Credit Suisse ""and belies the relentless pursuit for safe equities that offer solid corporate earnings late in the business cycle."" That value has lagged both the broader market and certainly growth stocks for the past decade, and also for the past 2 months, is hardly news: with central bank backstops, investors have flocked to companies that boast high growth and/or low-volatility, claiming that ""cheap stocks are cheap for a good reason."" More recently, companies with strong balance sheets have also joined the rally, amid some fringe expectations that we have come to the end of the rally and it's time to rotate into ""safer"" corporations with little to no debt.",CS,en,Zero Hedge

However, it's not just bonds where volatility has evaporated: in addition to equities in both developed and emerging markets, vol has also crashed in currency trading, as represented below by the Deutsche Bank CVIX FX vol index. In light of this collapse in volatility across virtually all asset classes, it's no no surprise, SocGen's FX strategist Kit Juckers writes, ""that we're fielding more questions that usual about why volatility is so low in the FX market. Nor is it all that surprising that FX carry strategies are back in vogue."" As Juckes explains, there are four ingredients that combine to make this low volatility, carry-favourable environment: The first is the US interest rate backdrop. As Juckes explains, the peak in Fed Funds seems likely to be even lower than the downward-revised estimates of neutral real rates suggested, and there's enough econometric work out there showing that how fed Funds behave through the cycle is the biggest driver of volatility.",CS,en,Zero Hedge

The move has so far failed to have an impact on stocks, which are modestly lower in early trading, in line with pre-market expectations. While there has been no specific catalyst behind the move, traders ascribe the move to two potential drivers: one is the wider sell-off across the Atlantic, where bunds and gilts have been weighing notably across the back-end of the curve, with Bloomberg noting a sudden weakness across core European fixed-income and a jump in bund futures volume on breach of earlier lows, suggesting this was an algo-driven stop-led activity. As Bloomberg notes, there were around 12k RXH9 contracts traded in the drop from 166.14 to 166.06, a move that breached the earlier 166.10 lows; contract bottomed at 166.05 as 10-year Germany yields topped above 13bp.",CS,en,Zero Hedge

This is the longest win streak for the dollar since January 2016 and Credit Suisse has five reasons to believe the dollar will continue to surge: 1.

The two-year real rate differential between the US and Germany has fallen to lows not seen since the financial crisis, as shown in the chart below, the euro has yet to catch down. 2. The US current account deficit has not deteriorated, thanks to oil 12 months ago, the US overtook Saudi Arabia to become the largest oil producer globally. In turn, US net oil imports have declined to below 0.5% of GDP, close to their lowest level in 25 years. That has allowed the US current account deficit to stabilize despite the boost to consumption driven by tax reform in 2018.Moreover, as the chart below highlights, there have been periods when the USD has become significantly more overvalued despite a widening deficit, with the most notable being the mid-1980s. 3.",CS,en,Zero Hedge

One month after the European antitrust regulators charged Deutsche Bank, Credit Agricole and Credit Suisse of being a part of a 'bond trading cartel', regulators are bringing a separate case against eight unidentified European banks alleging that they conspired to rigging euro-denominated sovereign bond markets. Reuters reported Thursday that the European Union’s antitrust authority has charged the banks with operating the cartel behind 2007 and 2012. Just like in past cartel cases, traders at the accused banks allegedly used chat rooms to share ""commercially sensitive information and coordinated trading strategies"" that they presumably used to rig markets to benefit their own trading books - and shortchange their ""counterparties"". If they're found guilty, the banks could face fines equal to up to 10% of their global turnover. ""The Commission has concerns that, at different periods between 2007 and 2012, the eight banks participated in a collusive scheme that aimed at distorting competition when acquiring and trading European government bonds,"" the Commission said.

2018-12-31 10:30:00-05:00,From 'Goldilocks' To 'Oh God' - Equities In 2018 Were A Pandora's Box,"Authored by Peter Garnry via Saxo Bank, This past year was one long roller-coaster ride for equities with the highs and the lows punctuated by a mishmash of mixed messages, misinterpreted signals and even – wait for it – what could be a gargantuan policy misstep. As planets orbiting stars, financial markets have gone full circle from a year ago. The headlines of late 2017 and early 2018 headlines were replete with bullish noises about how great the economy had become and how animal spirits had been let loose. From early November 2017 to late January 2018 the S&P 500 gained around 11% as logic was left outside in the cold. We didn't buy the hype and our Q1 2018 Equity Outlook was coined “The most important year since 2008” and our main point was: “For Q1 we acknowledge the strong price momentum and upbeat expectations together with what will likely become a strong earnings season reflecting past events. This is causing us to believe equities can push higher very short-term but that in the second half of Q1 macro data will begin to disappoint against expectations causing an equity correction above 7%, something we have not seen since Brexit.” (Q1 2018 Quarterly Outlook) The word “synchronous” was the buzzword of 2018 as Quartz so eloquently put in on 31 January 2018.",CS,en,Zero Hedge
