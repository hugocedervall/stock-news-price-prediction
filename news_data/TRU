Of note, neither candidate has announced specific fintech plans, but we can infer a lot from their distinct politics. We think Biden would focus on consumer protection and increasing regulatory oversight, while President Trump would continue to dismantle financial regulation. While financial regulation loosened under the Trump administration, Biden seems set to strengthen oversight and launch new initiatives for financial inclusion. President Trump has eased financial regulation over the last four years, and will likely continue to do so if re-elected. For example, under the current administration, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau stripped a key provision for payday lenders, meaning they no longer have to check whether consumers have the ability to repay a loan. A Biden administration would likely try to rescind or rewrite those rules, as the former vice president previously stated that the decision ""to loosen restrictions against predatory behavior by payday lenders is shameful by itself."" Biden has also called for the creation of a public credit reporting agency competing against the likes of Equifax and TransUnion.",TRU,en,Business Insider

The first thing is failing to consider the impact of opportunity costs, such as overpaying for insurance when you could be putting more money towards your retirement. The second is skipping out on umbrella insurance — coverage that could help you in the event of a personal liability emergency. Finally, I see many clients forget to check their credit reports, missing out on potential identify theft or inaccuracies, which could impact your ability to get the best interest rates.

2020-07-28 01:58:03-05:00,How is credit score calculated?,"Having a good credit score gives you leverage while applying for a loan as it assures the lender of your creditworthiness. A credit bureau (such as TransUnion CIBIL, Experian, CRIF High Mark and Equifax) will consolidate your past credit history and repayment behaviour and will provide a comprehensive report to lenders. A credit score typically ranges between 300 and 900, with 900 being the highest score possible. A higher score makes you more creditworthy and vice versa. Typically, a score of around 750 or above is considered ideal to get your loan application approved by a lender such as a bank.Here are five factors that play an important role in the calculation of one's credit score.1. Your repayment historyYour repayment history influences your credit score the most. A credit bureau keeps a month-on-month record of your payments towards your bills and loan repayment equated monthly instalments (EMIs) for the past few years. Adhil Shetty, CEO, Bankbazaar.com said that normally by collating last 3 years payment history data, the credit bureau calculates your credit score.""
