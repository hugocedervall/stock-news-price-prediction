Louney says that could take gold to record highs. He says the combination of low interest rates and enormous economic stimulus has been good for both gold and stocks — and notes that even if stocks continue to rally, elevated uncertainty should help gold as well. Even if the post-coronavirus recovery is more difficult than he expects, gold prices are also likely to obliterate their all-time highs next year, he predicts. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . When stocks go way down, gold prices shoot up. It's one of those market rules everybody knows — but it might be ancient history now. RBC commodity strategist Christopher Louney says the forces shaping the market today — a combination of multi-trillion dollar economic stimulus, low interest rates, and enormous uncertainty — mean that gold prices should keep rising even if stocks continue their furious rally from the last six weeks. ""The same policies that are meant to stimulate economic growth are simultaneously stimulating gold too, but from a different angle,"" he wrote in a note to clients. ""During a crisis like this, gold can gain alongside equities as economics begin to recover, even while it simultaneously serves as a means to hedge against embedded risks."" He adds that all of that remains true even if there is little sign of inflation in 2020 or 2021.",NEM,en,Business Insider

The veteran investor says why he avoids red hot technology stocks like Amazon and instead bets his money on gold mining companies. «We’ve reignited speculation. At this point, it’s an all-out printathon: In 2008, the Fed printed up a trillion dollars in eight months. Now, they have printed up two trillion dollars in six weeks.» Since the monster crash in March, stock markets have calmed down noticeably. Yet, this week’s unprecedented turmoil in the oil space raises new concerns that financial markets remain fragile despite massive monetary and fiscal stimulus programs.

The mine was only producing 40,000 ounces of gold a year back then (around $16 million annually) … and the sellers believed the land held 600,000 ounces easily minable gold. But those estimates were woefully short. By 1992, the mine yielded 1.1 million ounces of gold. Today, the mine, known as Goldstrike, is the richest mine in North America – producing over two million ounces per year. And it has reserves of over 21 million ounces of gold. Although the Goldstrike acquisition proved to be his best, Munk bought many other successful gold mines. He was the founder of the world’s largest gold producer, Barrick Gold. And his company earned the top spot through deal making… Before buying Goldstrike, Munk bought half the Renabie mine in Ontario… then the Camflo mine in Quebec. But it was Barrick’s 2005 acquisition of Placer Dome that gave the company its title as the world’s largest gold producer and cemented its place at the top of the food chain.",NEM,en,Zero Hedge

2019-01-14 05:57:39-05:00,Newmont Mining To Buy Goldcorp In $10 Billion Deal To Create World's Largest Gold Miner,"In the latest deal in what's becoming a wave of consolidation among gold miners, Newmont Mining announced on Monday that it would buy smaller miner Gold Corp in a deal valued at $10 billion. The deal could create the largest gold miner in the world, with operations stretching from the Americas, to Australia and Ghana, the companies said. Newmont will offer 0.3280 of its share and two cents for each share of its Canadian rival, according to CNBC . The deal is the largest in the space since Randgold and Barrick announced their plans to merge back in September. As the Wall Street Journal pointed out, the depletion of global gold mines and the resulting increase in extraction costs has pushed gold miners to seek cost efficiencies and smaller-scale combinations. “The strategic rationale for combining Goldcorp with Newmont is powerfully compelling on many levels.” Goldcorp Chief Executive Officer David Garofalo said in a statement. Goldcorp shares climbed 1.3% in premarket trading on the news.",NEM,en,Zero Hedge

2018-12-26 19:04:28-05:00,"Three ""Crazy Market Stats"" After Today's Historic Day","What has traditionally been the quietest week for markets is shaping up this year to be one of historic turmoil and triumph for traders. One trading day after the S&P500 suffered its biggest Christmas Eve rout on record, the index enjoyed its biggest point surge on record (as did the Dow Jones), and the biggest percentage rebound since the financial crisis, with today's 4.96% jump only the largest since the 7% QE1-driven surge in March of 2009. There were three other ""crazy market statistics"" as Bloomberg dubbed them , that defined today's market actions: All three major U.S. indexes gained at least 4% on Wednesday: That was the first time the market had such a widespread bounce since 2011. Additionally, both the Dow and the S&P came a just hair shy of topping 5% on the day. The Dow's performance perfectly mirrored its last trading day: on Monday, all 30 Dow member stocks finished in the red. Today, all green. That was the first time that has occurred since 2015 and just the 10th time since 2000.",NEM,en,Zero Hedge
