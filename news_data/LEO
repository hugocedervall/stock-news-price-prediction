NASA, who generally doesn't comment on these types of developments, recently published a stark warning for AST & Science, which intends to launch a massive constellation of hundreds of large 5G satellites. NASA engineer Samantha Fonder expressed concern about AST's 5G mega constellation of satellites in a recently penned letter to FCC's Marleen Dortch, about how the space agency worries its assets in orbit could experience a ""catastrophic collision,"" reported Ars Technica . ""NASA submits this letter during the public comment period for the purpose of providing a better understanding of NASA's concerns with respect to its assets on-orbit, to further mitigate the risks of collisions for the mutual benefit of all involved,"" Fonder wrote. Since AST's satellites are large, she noted that they could cause thousands of probable accidents every year.",LEO,en,Zero Hedge
