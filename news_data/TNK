2020-02-27 14:47:12-05:00,Great Quarter For Tankers Coincides With Stock-Market Rout,"Pity the public tanker owners. After years of suffering through terrible freight markets, they finally have a breakout quarter to boast about — and just as they do so, the broader stock market is crashing around them on coronavirus fears. ""It has actually felt like a bit of a horror movie at times, to be honest,"" said Frontline (NYSE: FRO ) CEO Robert Macleod during a conference call with analysts on Thursday. ""It seems that the world is getting one shock after another but surely there must be some good news soon."" Two of the largest publicly listed tanker owners have just reported results for the fourth quarter of 2019 — Frontline and Teekay Tankers (NYSE: TNK ). Frontline announced ""its highest quarterly income in more than 11 years."" Teekay Tankers CEO Kevin Mackay touted ""one of the most profitable quarters since the end of the tanker-market super cycle in 2009."" Despite this outperformance, shares of Frontline and Teekay Tankers are down around 45% and 38%, respectively, year to date (on a positive note, shares of both companies were up at midday on Thursday, Teekay Tankers in particular on strong forward guidance).",TNK,en,Benzinga Feeds

2020-01-14 09:10:32-05:00,Why Haven't Iran Tensions Hiked Tanker Rates (Yet)?,"What makes markets so interesting — and maddening — is that they tend to behave in ways you didn't expect. Take crude-tanker shipping. In October 2019, the threat to oil exports from the Middle East pushed spot freight rates to $190,000 per day. The supply-demand balance is even tighter now, and Middle East crude flows are once again theoretically under threat, so rates and tanker stock pricing should shoot up again, right? In fact, rates have held relatively steady and stock prices are down. The U.S. killed Iranian general Qassem Suleimani on Jan. 2. Iran retailed with airstrikes on Iraqi bases housing Americans on Jan. 7. If markets followed the pattern seen in the second half of last year, oil shippers would have bid up spot rates as they sought to secure cargoes as a hedge against possible military action in and around the Strait of Hormuz. They haven't, at least not yet. According to Clarksons Platou Securities, rates for very large crude carriers (VLCCs, tankers that carry 2 million barrels of crude each) averaged $92,300 per day on Jan. 10, down 13% from the day before and down 3% week-on-week.",TNK,en,Benzinga Feeds
