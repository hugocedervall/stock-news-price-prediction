2019-04-10 07:00:00-05:00,The World's Gold Majors are Facing a Real Estate Crisis,"LONDON , April 10, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Forget about peak oil. The real crisis hitting the commodity markets is peak gold. The Financial Post reports that ""all major deposits have been discovered."" Goldman Sachs forecasts there may be only 20 years of supply left. The world's gold majors may soon be in a real estate bidding war. Mentioned in today's commentary includes: Seabridge Gold Inc. (NYSE: SA ) (TSX: SEA ), Teck Resources (NYSE: TECK ) (TSX: TECK ), Teck Resources (NYSE: TECK ) (TSX: TECK ), Great Panther Mining (NYSE: GPR ) (TSX: GPR ). Endeavor Silver (NYSE: EXK ) (TSX: EDR ). For companies like Euro Sun ( ESM , CPNFF ), this could represent a major windfall. Their Rovina Valley project in Romania is the #1 copper/gold resource in Europe - with reserves totaling 7.5 million ounces of gold and 1.5 billion pounds of copper. Rovina's previous owner - Carpathian Gold - spent $51 million sinking 138,000 meters of drill holes to prove up the potential $13.3 billion resource. It's a similar and, perhaps even better image, than that of the Timok project in neighboring Serbia, and the company that owns Timok was just snapped up for $1.4 billion .","EXAS,EXK",en,Benzinga
