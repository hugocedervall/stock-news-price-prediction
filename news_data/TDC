The so-called data warehouse could only run a few queries per day, slowing down the process of analyzing large amounts of information. To save themselves from frustration, Traverso and some fellow Facebook engineers set out to build something that was just as powerful but much faster. Their efforts became Presto, a big data engine that allowed Facebook to query large datasets in a matter of seconds. Presto allows engineers to analyze how Facebook's products are used and to make predictions based on that data. In 2013, Facebook made Presto publicly available as open source software to give outside people and companies access to it. The original team, including Traverso, didn't expect it to become popular, but companies like Netflix, Amazon, Airbnb, Dropbox, and Uber started integrating it into their own processes.",TDC,en,Business Insider
