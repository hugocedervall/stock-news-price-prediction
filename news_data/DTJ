2020-11-18 16:40:46-05:00,PG&E’s New CEO Faces Epic Task of Fixing ‘Culture of Ineptitude’,"(Bloomberg) -- After years of upheaval, criminal charges and bankruptcy, California utility giant PG&E Corp. has placed its fate in the hands of a new chief executive with a record of reducing accidents, cutting costs and building bridges.Patricia K. Poppe, a General Motors Co. veteran who now runs the Michigan utility CMS Energy Corp., will be PG&E’s fourth leader in the past two years, taking over on Jan. 4., the company said Wednesday in a statement.Her task is monumental. Not only must she reform a sprawling enterprise that’s been found responsible for sparking numerous deadly wildfires, she has to regain the trust of the public and government officials including Governor Gavin Newsom, who had threatened to take over the company if it didn’t correct its “culture of ineptitude.” And she has to do it while cutting $1 billion in costs.“What we have to see is if can we change the course of this company,” Robert Flexon, chairman of the board at PG&E, said during a media call with reporters. “I believe Patti can.”Expensive HireCritics won’t be easy to win over.","DTJ,DTE",en,Yahoo Finance

2020-11-16 10:30:00-05:00,Electric School Bus Fleets Test the US Vehicle-to-Grid Proposition,"There are good reasons for electric school buses to be the breakout vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology in the United States. At least, that’s how Duncan McIntyre, CEO of Highland Electric Transportation, sees it. McIntyre, who founded renewable energy procurement and analysis marketplace Alternex in 2011 and sold it to Edison International in 2015, started Highland Electric two years ago to build a “business entirely around the school bus electrification market.” The idea is to replace the up-front and ongoing costs of EV buses and charging infrastructure with a fixed annual fee, equal to or less than a school district’s current budget for owning, fueling and maintaining their existing diesel-fueled fleets. Highland finances the arrangement and recoups the investment by finding ways to earn money from the new fleet’s battery capacity when they’re not on the road. A major part of that equation relies on tapping their energy storage capacity for soaking up low-cost overnight or midday power — and more importantly, discharging it during grid-stressed evening peaks.","DTJ,DTE",en,Green Technology Media
2020-11-11 07:36:39-05:00,US utilities follow a “shift to safety” strategy,"In recent years, many US utilities have begun to follow a ""shift to safety"" strategy by rapidly shifting shares of capital spending away from competitive ventures and toward safer, state-regulated utility projects. Between 2016 and 2019, capital spending on state-regulated utility projects increased 10.5% per year, while utility capital spending on nonutility projects fell 6.5% per year (see Figure 1). The trend toward safety is likely to continue, as major announcements in 2020 from Avangrid (PNM Resources acquisition), DTE Energy (plans to spin-off midstream natural gas business) and PSEG (plans to divest nonnuclear competitive generation) all reflect an increase in strategic emphasis on regulated electric and gas utility operations. Figure 1: Annual increase/decrease in investor-owned electric utility capital spending by segment, 2016- 19 Driving the shift to safety A key factor driving the shift to safety is the rising risks and weakness associated with competitive, nonutility investments.","DTJ,DTE",en,IHS Markit
2020-11-10 13:16:00-05:00,Report: Evergy Rebuffs NextEra Energy’s $15B Acquisition Offer,"Midwestern utility Evergy rebuffed a $15 billion acquisition bid from NextEra Energy, according to a report from Reuters. If accurate, the news marks the latest unsuccessful attempt by the U.S. renewable energy leader to take advantage of its high stock price to expand its roster of regulated utilities. Evergy representatives did not immediately reply to Greentech Media’s request for comment on Reuters’ anonymously sourced report, which stated that the all-stock acquisition offer was rejected by Evergy in recent days. Debbie Larsson, a spokesperson for NextEra Energy, said in a Tuesday interview with Greentech Media that the company does not comment on market rumors as a matter of policy. Evergy, which serves 1.6 million customers in Kansas and Missouri, was formed in 2018 by the merger of Westar Energy and Kansas City Power & Light parent company Great Plains Energy. It was under pressure from shareholder Elliott Management Corp. to seek a buyer last year, but its board of directors acted to forestall the prospect of a takeover.","DTJ,DTE,DUK,DUKB,DUKH",en,Green Technology Media

2020-02-24 15:41:00-05:00,Michigan Utility DTE Ordered to Seek Out More Renewables,"Michigan's two big investor-owned utilities, Consumers Energy and DTE Energy, have both committed to meeting state-mandated clean energy targets and retiring coal plants by 2040. But according to state regulators, DTE’s plan doesn’t pass muster. Last week, the Michigan Public Service Commission ordered DTE to redo its integrated resource plan (IRP), due to “fundamental flaws” in how it addressed renewable energy as part of its 15-year resource plan. The PSC also ordered DTE to undertake an accelerated effort to seek out more renewable energy resources and improve energy efficiency, or face its entire plan being denied. The order gives the Detroit-area utility until March 21 to resubmit its IRP, and until April 1 to submit an amended renewable energy plan. It also orders a review of DTE’s resources under the state’s implementation of the federal Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA), which has driven much of the state’s renewable energy growth, and noted that it will require the utility to take a “truly integrated approach that considers both demand-side and supply-side resources.” The regulators' decision could to provide a boost to solar developers already active in serving the state's PURPA market.","DTJ,DTE,DTQ",en,Green Technology

With this decision, APS joins a growing list of major electric utilities committing to decarbonize their production. Xcel Energy, which spans eight states in the center of the continent, kicked off the trend in late 2018. It was joined by Duke Energy , New Jersey-based PSEG , DTE Energy and more. The APS commitment is notable in that Arizona has not passed sweeping climate or carbon policy at the state level. Yet clean energy policy has gained traction in other forums, like a recent unsuccessful ballot initiative and in deliberations at the Arizona Corporation Commission, the elected utility regulatory body. Acting now, APS can set the terms of the ongoing debate on how to modernize the state's power supply.","DUKB,DUK,DUKH,DTQ,DTE,DTJ",en,Green Technology

2019-12-16 08:05:00-05:00,We interviewed Wall Street's 7 top-performing investors to get their secrets for success — and their best ideas for 2020,"Business Insider spoke with the seven best-performing large-cap fund managers of the year, based on a trailing one-year basis through the end of September. The fund managers outlined which thematic and single-stock strategies paid off for them this year, and they laid out their top trades and ideas for 2020. If you followed only financial-news headlines in 2019, you might assume the market had a tough year. Recession fears flared, trade-war tensions ebbed and flowed with ferocity, and corporate earnings growth slowed. Yet the benchmark S&P 500 was still up 19% year-to-date through the end of September. Thank the Federal Reserve and its overt willingness to continuing stimulating an economic expansion that's already the longest in history. But even amid a robust market environment that saw every major stock index climb for the year, a handful of fund managers stood out as the cream of the crop. These were the people and firms that were still able to outperform, even though equities and other risk assets were so strong across the board.","DTQ,DTE,DTJ",en,Business Insider

But over the past few years, the Wolverine state’s energy future has begun to shift dramatically — and now, state leaders have launched a comprehensive effort to tie it all together. It’s called MI Power Grid , and according to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the Michigan Public Service Commission, it’s going to be the central source for Michigan residents and businesses seeking to take part in the state’s broader energy transformation. Those include “new clean energy programs and rates, advancements in how energy infrastructure is planned to meet customer needs, and updated regulations to improve customer service and reliability.” “These are what I would call really important building blocks for what some would call the utility of the future, others would call regulatory reform, others would call transformation of utility business models,” Ryan Katofsky, managing director for the Advanced Energy Economy trade group, a big supporter of MI Power Grid, said in a recent interview.","DTQ,DTE,DTJ",en,Green Technology
