(NYSE: R ) a front-row seat to the strength of the used truck market, a perspective that CEO Robert Sanchez shared with analysts on the company's second-quarter earnings call Wednesday. Ryder's earnings are impacted significantly by its proceeds from used truck sales. The relatively weak second quarter the company turned in, however, appears to be far more of a function of a big slide in demand for its leased vehicles under its Fleet Management Solutions segment. On the call, Sanchez said rental utilization of power units was 56% in the second quarter of 2020, down from 75% in the second quarter of 2019. The used vehicle sales are under that division also. And while the company sold more vehicles in the quarter, it took in a lot less money.
