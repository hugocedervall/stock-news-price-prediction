But now, as some Christmas shoppers are finding out, it also comes with some brand new negatives - including bots that have been tasked with buying up every new ""hot"" Christmas item as soon as it goes on sale online with major retailers. Such has been the case with items like the Playstation 5, which has been bought up on sites by bots that ""resellers use to snatch up products online and relist them moments later at significant mark-ups on eBay and Amazon Marketplace,"" according to Reuters . And with most people shopping from home this year, the total addressable market for online resellers has never been bigger. 26 year old Benjamin Karmis from Illinois, who has been trying for weeks to buy a Playstation 5, said: “There is no possible way that I could have been more prepared to get one, and I have failed every single time.” And it's not just Playstations the bots are looking to buy.",NKE,en,Zero Hedge

""We looked at a plethora of issues and landed on this because it ties really well to our brand purpose of creating possibility in the kitchen,"" said Robert Sundy, head of brand and creative at KitchenAid's parent company Whirlpool. ""There's an increasing expectation [from consumers] that brands have shared values and purpose —that's what drives loyalty and engagement."" KitchenAid isn't alone. The rising adoption of over-the-top streaming, growth of purpose-driven marketing, and increase in ad-skipping had led more brands to get on the documentary bandwagon. For instance: Brands including Nike, Johnson & Johnson, HP , and 23andMe have made documentaries in the past few years. Verizon started making its first documentaries in 2017, and has produced four, including two this year. P&G has prioritized long-form content in recent years, producing films such as ""The Talk"" and ""The Look.""

If you have an American Express card, you may see Amex Offers for cash back on wine purchases, or for bonus points on food delivery. See Business Insider's list of the best rewards credit cards. In the scheme of things, not being able to fully maximize your rewards credit cards during the coronavirus pandemic isn't the biggest problem.

The high street clothing retailer said its commitment to the Charter would see it combat the supply chain emissions that make up the vast majority of its carbon footprint, and that it would soon be setting out a detailed decarbonisation pathway drawing on methogologies of the Science-Based Targets initiative. Primark joins more than 100 companies - including Mango, Levi Strauss & Co, Decathlon, Arc'teryx, Adidas and Nike - which have signed up to the UN Fashion Charter. First established two years ago at the COP24 UN climate summit in Poland, the initiative aims to boost climate action within the carbon-intensive textile, clothing and fashion industries. ""As a global fashion retailer, we are passionate about finding solutions to the challenges of climate change and recognise that there is always more to do,"" said Katharine Stewart, ethical trade and environmental sustainability director at Primark. ""While we have big ambitions to make our business more sustainable, we also know that even our small changes can make a big difference, simply because of our size."" The goals mark a major milestone for the fashion retailer, which has previously faced accusations that its low-cost clothing helps fuel a throwaway, fast-fashion culture that drives up the amount of textile waste going to landfill.",NKE,en,BusinessGreen

What’s on my mind? Carbontech, a category of climate tech I’d love to see break through next year. It's the exciting idea that we can take something that could be considered waste, draw it out of the atmosphere and turn it into a source of revenue or economic growth. There are signs that give me optimism. This morning, digital payments company Stripe announced a plan to let its merchant customers divert a portion of their revenue to carbon removal projects. The move follows Stripe’s own pledge to put $1 million into four ""high potential"" projects earlier this year, and the two initiatives are related. The specific technologies that Stripe is funding are carbon-sequestering cement (CarbonCure), geologic storage (Charm Industrial), direct air capture (Climeworks) and ocean mineralization (Project Vesta). ""Stripe’s climate initiative is a gift because it removes all barriers to positive action,"" wrote Substack CEO Chris Best, a beta tester, in a statement.

A Bloomberg analysis of United Nations data found that Gen Z represents nearly one-third of the world's population. As Gen Z teenagers move towards adulthood and represent a larger portion of consumer spending, a lot of attention is paid to their habits and preferences when it comes to spending. Piper Sandler released its 40th biannual ""Taking Stock with Teens"" report , which showed teenagers' ""self-reported"" spending hit at an all-time survey low of $2,150, marking a drop of 9% from last fall's survey. Annual self reported spending hit an all-time high of $3,023 in the spring of 2006. Piper Sandler surveyed 9,800 teens with an average age of 15.8 years old across 48 states online between August 19 and September 22. 48% of the respondents believe the economy is getting worse compared to 47% in the spring and just 32% last fall. 33% of those surveyed said they are currently part-time employed, while 23% of those not working said Covid-19 affected their ability to work.",NKE,en,Zero Hedge

Now, it wants to apply that know-how to help brands like Pepsi and Champs develop products of their own with a new agency, Climate. Today, it announced the first leadership hires for the agency, Stanley Lumax, managing director; and Michael Tresvant, SVP of business development. Edgar Hernandez, CRO of Complex Networks, said the idea to start Climate grew out of having companies ask for help replicating Complex Networks' success with its own products along with events like ComplexCon, an annual event for streetwear fans in Long Beach, Calif. Climate essentially formalizes work that Complex Networks has already done in this area. It's made a limited-edition version of PepsiCo's Brisk with Anwar Carrots, a streetwear designer known for his graphic T-shirts; and developed online video series for Champs, for example, as Digiday reported. ""There were so many proof points in front of us — the number of people saying 'We want our own ComplexCon,'"" Hernandez said. ""We're betting this is going to be a big part of our business that could be as big as our media business over the next five years.""

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell more than 2%, and all 11 of the major S&P sectors closed lower. Energy - already the worst-performing sector this year - led the rout in its biggest single-day decline since July 9.[O/R] Hopes of a strong recovery and historic stimulus fueled the U.S. stock rally following the coronavirus-driven crash in March. But doubts over another relief bill and a sell-off in heavyweight technology-related stocks have weighed on sentiment since the market peaked on Sept. 2. Wednesday's plunge came six months to the day that U.S. stocks on March 23 tumbled to their lowest point during the pandemic-induced selloff. The economy is now leveling off at about 80% of activity before the pandemic and won't get back to normal until a vaccine is in place, said Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede in Philadelphia. ""We're at that phase where it's harder to get that next bit of the recovery, that next bit of the reopening in place,"" Pride said. ""We're still doing it, but the progress is way slower than it was in the first three months of the reopening."" Investors are struggling to understand where to invest with mega-cap tech stocks trading well above their long-term fair value, but the deep-value stocks represent maturing industries, such as energy and brick-and-mortar banks, he said. ""We're spending more of our time in that sweet spot in the middle to get away from the extremes of growth,"" Pride said.",NKE,en,Economic Times India

Here's what you should know.","Summary List Placement ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, and mutual funds have a lot in common. Both investment products pool investors' money into a collection of assets — typically stocks, but can be other assets like bonds, real estate, and commodities. Geared towards individuals, both offer a low-cost, diversified way to invest. But ETFs and mutual funds also hold important differences, especially in the way they're traded and managed, and what they charge and how they're taxed. What is a mutual fund? A mutual fund is a group of assets like stocks or bonds that you can purchase by pooling money with other investors. They are run by a professional portfolio manager who selects the fund based on a published investing strategy, so all the investors (and regulatory bodies like the SEC) know what they're getting when they invest. As of 2019, there are nearly 8,000 US-based mutual funds with total assets worth a staggering $21.3 trillion, according to Statista.

The research used to develop and improve space suits, time-keeping systems, temperature measurements, and other space-related needs is often later adapted for consumer use.

If you weren't obsessed enough already with the work that NASA does to advance our knowledge of space, here's another reason: its research has a large number of applications beyond space suits and shuttles. Though the science it engages with can seem nebulously complicated, it's really all around us in the products we use every day.

2020-08-07 09:33:46-05:00,A new putter for Tiger Woods proves a talking point after strong first round | Ewan Murray,"Woods is known for loyalty to a club that helped win 14 majors but he has seen good results after switching to a longer handle for the US PGA Championship It was never coincidence that multimillion-dollar equipment deals involving Tiger Woods had no detail about putters. Rough calculations suggest the Scotty Cameron Newport that Woods had in play between 1999 and 2010 was key to $100m in prize money alongside 14 major titles. “I always travel with it,” says Woods of the wand in question. No wonder. If not, he would be entitled to frame it. Someone of Woods’s standing doesn’t tinker with clubs lightly. This is what makes a change of putter for the US PGA Championship more notable than it would be for virtually any other player in the field. Rory McIlroy threw a fresh set of irons into his bag at a recent PGA Tour stop and the world’s best players – Brooks Koepka is a key exception here – switch drivers whenever their paymasters want to entice amateurs towards a new model. Woods’s longevity has been matched by a reliance on pretty much an identical feel on the greens.",NKE,en,The Guardian

Der Herzogenauracher Konzern rechnet im dritten Quartal wieder mit Gewinnen, einen Ausblick auf das Gesamtjahr traut er sich wegen der Unsicherheiten in der momentanen Situation jedoch nicht zu. Zum Höhepunkt der Corona-Krise im April hatten nach Angaben des Unternehmens mehr als 70 Prozent aller Adidas-Läden weltweit geschlossen. Inzwischen sei der Großteil wieder geöffnet, in China stabilisierten sich die Umsätze. Diese Entwicklungen machen der Adidas AG Hoffnung: «Wir erwarten eine signifikante Erholung im dritten Quartal», sagte Rorsted.

2020-08-05 11:18:00-05:00,The best running shoes for men,"One of the most important aspects of running correctly and effectively is choosing the right footwear, no matter if you're logging miles on a treadmill or pounding the pavement outside. The best running shoes offer support when and where you need it, have a design fit for the style of running you prefer, and remain durable for many miles. Our top pick, the New Balance 1080v10 , excels in a range of areas, making it the best all-around shoe, whether you're putting in the miles for your first marathon or taking a weekend jog through the park. Not long ago, every running shoe was a variation on mostly the same design: A mesh upper with a thin slab of foam sandwiched in the middle and a rubber sole glued to the bottom. That changed in 2012 when Nike introduced its innovative Flyknit threading technology, which produced a form-fitting but breathable upper for its running shoes. Adidas upped the ante years later with Boost, a supremely bouncy foam the company pumped into the midsole of its shoes to give them added energy return.",NKE,en,Business Insider

They want to introduce a billion people to blockchain. “The reason we decided to go for entertainment — specifically games — is because we felt that it’s just a much easier way to introduce folks to decentralization,” explains co-founder Mik Naayem. “Gamers are the perfect target market as they already understand virtual currencies and virtual worlds.” In November 2017 CryptoKitties was Dapper Labs’ Trojan Cat, and the game introduced the revolutionary concept of NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens) to hundreds of thousands of people who had never used the word “fungible” in their lives. It is widely believed, at least by those in the blockchain industry, that these unique or scarce digital objects have the potential to transform the internet and underpin new virtual economies.

Speaking during the session, sponsored by the Allied Committee for the Trucking Industry (Act 1), Dennis Dellinger, president and CEO of Cargo Transporters , said he hoped for a more gradual recovery rather than a sharp uptick. ""I think it's possible we may see a Nike Swoosh [-shaped recovery], and I guess if I could sit here and have a preference, for me, I'd rather see that than a V, and definitely [not] a U or even W,"" he said.

Speaking on a panel along with Dan Doran, president of Doran Logistics Services , Ed Nagle, president of Nagle Toledo , and Dave Williams, executive vice president of Knight Transportation , Dellinger said his fleet had just restarted driver orientation programs.

Insider Intelligence analyzes this industry and several others to provide in-depth analyst reports, proprietary forecasts, customizable charts, and more. Learn more about what we offer. As brands decide on whether or not to weigh in on the current nationwide #BlackLivesMatter protests, new Morning Consult research shows that brands are more likely to be viewed unfavorably if they make ""no official statement."" Taking no stance is the only recorded option that had a negative net favorability not only among US adults in general but also among both black and white adults. 22% overall said they would have a less favorable view of a brand that didn't make an official statement, while 15% said they would have a more favorable view. While the net favorability of not providing an official statement was negative, it's worth noting that over two-thirds said that it either had no impact on their favorability toward the brand or that they didn't know/didn't have an opinion.",NKE,en,Business Insider

The frozen-dessert company's missive also distinguished itself with its specificity: the message expressed support for concrete policy steps, including the passage of Democratic-sponsored legislation creating a commission to study the effects of slavery and discrimination and to consider reparation proposals; and the establishment of a task force supported by Floyd's family's to draft ""bipartisan legislation aimed at ending racial violence and increasing police accountability.""

This is the biggest single-day shopping at a luxury outlet in China.As more people come out of quarantine, there could be a spree of “revenge spending” at least among those who can splurge but could not because of lockdown. Revenge spending refers to an overindulgence in retail therapy by consumers who have missed shopping at their favourite outlets due to the lockdown. Long queues, fuelled by revenge spending sprees, have been seen outside outlets of brands such as Apple, Nike, Gucci, Estée Lauder and Lancôme, among others, in Chinese cities.Could we witness such behaviour in India? There is no way to know.Nikhil Prasad Ojha, partner, Bain & Company, sees two distinct consumer trends playing out — consumption among low-income groups dropping after lockdown while high-income households remain unaffected. “There will be a flight to value — shifting to cheaper alternatives (among mass market consumers) and simultaneously an uptick in premium segments given the sustained ability of high income households to spend,” he adds.Luxury might be a necessity for a few, but most shoppers will stick to what they need to buy and hold the urge to splurge for more predictable times.Nitin Jain, MD of Alvarez & Marsal (India), says, “India and China consumers are not an apples-to-apples comparison.",NKE,en,Economic Times India

Here's why we should all try one on.,"Face masks are being touted as a way to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus around the world, when physical distancing isn't possible. But surgical masks were never really designed to catch or trap viruses, and they're also not as readily available, or easy to clean as face shields, which also provide a lot of protection against spreading virus particles. Here are a few of the best reasons you may want to consider trading in your mask for a clear shield, according to doctors. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . Wearing a mask to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in public has quickly become the norm in cities from New York, to Berlin . In Paris, Mayor Anne Hidalgo has just promised to give out enough free, washable cloth masks for everyone in the city to have one, as the city of lights prepares to reopen. But as people around the world weigh the best ways to slowly move back into public life, a team of three doctors and public health experts from Iowa City is respectfully suggesting that perhaps the shield may be mightier than the mask. ""Could a simple and affordable face shield, if universally adopted, provide enough added protection when added to testing, contact tracing , and hand hygiene to reduce transmissibility below a critical threshold?"" they asked, in a JAMA opinion article released on Wednesday.",NKE,en,Business Insider

2020-02-09 13:10:00-05:00,The Roadmap For 2020 Profits Is Filled With Potholes,"The Roadmap For 2020 Profits Is Filled With Potholes Submitted by Joseph Carson , former Chief Economist & Director of Global Economic Research for Alliance Bernstein Analysts and investors have been betting on a rebound in operating profits for 2020, even though profits are running up against a powerful (negative) trend in the annals of business cycles. New events on the international side of business will lower those odds even further. Operating Profits Although Q4 2019 and full year operating profits have not been released in the GDP figures it is easy to derive a year-end and an annual figure based on the available data. Operating profits for 2019 are estimated at $2,065 billion, off 0.5% from the prior year total, and extend the streak of annual declines in operating profits to 5, making it the longest stretch of consecutive annual declines in the post-period surpassing the prior record of 4 at the end of the 1990s. Moreover, it’s hard to get optimistic about a rebound in operating profits anytime soon.",NKE,en,Zero Hedge

US companies are required to publish their chief executives' annual compensation, as well as the ratio of that compensation to the annual pay of the company's median employee. Using those ratios, we calculated how long it took CEOs at 19 of the biggest companies in the US to make what at typical employee earned in a year. Several CEOs, including Disney CEO Bob Iger and Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson, took less than a day to make a typical employee's annual salary. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . CEOs make a lot more than the workers they oversee. We took a look at just how big that gap is at some of America's biggest corporations. One of the provisions of the post-financial-crisis Dodd-Frank reform bill requires corporations to disclose the ratio of their CEO's pay to that of the median employee at the company. Using those pay ratios, we calculated how long it would take the CEOs of big US companies to make what the median employee earned in a year.",NKE,en,Business Insider

2020-02-01 05:58:12-05:00,The kimono – from costume to catwalk,"From the 17th to the 20th century the kimono was the principal piece of clothing in Japan for both men and women. But now it’s an inspiration for fashion all over the world Fashion as we know it – the business of clothes-as-zeitgeist, as distinct from simple dressmaking – was invented in Paris by Louis XIV in the second half of the 17th century. This, at least, is fashion’s widely accepted creation myth. The Sun King and his finance minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, established a luxury fashion industry which enshrined France as the world leader in taste. To help the lavish new court at Versailles eclipse the austere, black-clad glamour of Madrid, they introduced a rigid schedule whereby new fabrics were issued twice a year – not just warmer or lighter to reflect the weather, but in new colours each time – and the fashion “season” was born. But travel 6,000 miles east to Kyoto, home of the kimono, and the history of fashion looks quite different. In the late 17th century, a demand for luxury textiles among the burgeoning Japanese merchant class grew so fast that by 1700 the narrow streets of the Nishijin district thundered to the clacking of an estimated 7,000 looms.",NKE,en,The Guardian

These days, Gen Z pop stars, from Amandla Stenberg to Miley Cyrus, are regularly seen with body hair. Brands are cottoning on, too. Last year, Nike and No7 ran advertisements with models showing body hair (underarms and upper lip respectively). Even the ubiquitous advert trope of a woman shaving an already shaven leg was challenged by the razor company Billie, which had marketing collateral that showed underarm, leg and pubic hair . In real life, however, the sight of a woman in public with body hair remains rare, although norms are slowly changing (almost one in four women under 25 no longer shave their armpits, compared with just one in 20 in 2013, according to the market analyst Mintel ).",NKE,en,The Guardian

It may be a loaned Bentley (the gap hasn’t closed that much) but the England forward does have numerous sponsorship deals, with Nike and Swarovski among others. If the Noughties was the decade in which players such as Alex Scott edged from washing the shirts and shorts of the Arsenal men’s team towards the possibility of scraping a living from football, then this has been the decade that has provided, most importantly, respect and with it professionalism, sponsorship, support and the chance to make a modest living out of the game.",NKE,en,The Guardian

However, the last year has seen a radical rethink in our understanding of how to design for disability.

In fact, searches for adaptive clothing saw an increase of 80% over 2019, according to global fashion search platform Lyst.

The e-commerce giant has had its fair share of ‘not-good' news this year that are threatening the company's growth, the one for which the company often sacrificed profits for. Why Nike offered only a vague explanation, saying it will focus on elevating its consumer experiences through more direct relationships. Obviously, the plus of being on Amazon is the platforms' huge base of customers, but the minus being shared revenues. Amazon's loyal (and Prime) members are often surprised if there is something they cannot find on the platform and this will be the case with Nike.

Netflix could generate some $1.3 billion in revenue by 2021 if it introduced an ad-supported tier in the US, according to Nomura's Instinet analysts. Although Netflix execs have continually reiterated they would never bring ads to the service, traditional media execs including NBCUniversal ad sales chief Linda Yaccarino and Hulu ad sales chief Peter Naylor recently argued that Netflix would eventually need to offer ads. If its subscriptions growth slows, Netflix could need to diversify its business to offset growing costs and reduce its debt load.

Volkswagen AG paid its CEO around €8 million last year, less than half the $22 million Mary Barra made at General Motors Co., even though VW’s sales are almost twice the size of GM’s. And on average, German leaders earn 97 times as much as employees, vs. 312 times as much at the biggest U.S. companies, according to the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. Yet a trio of German millennials could upend the status quo—and become Europe’s highest-paid executives in the process. Zalando SE’s three co-CEOs—Robert Gentz, David Schneider, and Rubin Ritter—stand to rake in a combined $570 million if they can more than triple the share price and roughly double the sales generated by Europe’s largest online fashion retailer within five years.",NKE,en,Bloomberg
