In the first quarter of this year, the pork giant’s earnings were up 190% over the same period in 2019.

Smithfield, the largest pork company in the world with 42,000 employees in 40 U.S. locations, decided to invest in some relatively new technology to deal with the threat of contagion.Howard Anderson, the company’s chief engineer, said he reviewed a range of novel approaches, but is most hopeful when it comes to ionized hydrogen peroxide vapor—and a machine to spread it built by Dayton, Ohio-based Extreme Microbial Technologies (EMT).“What we liked about [EMT] is that it’s a proactive solution,” said Anderson.",CMG,en,Economic Times India
