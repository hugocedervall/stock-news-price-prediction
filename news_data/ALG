2020-07-05 00:00:34-05:00,Drinks that add sizzle to summer barbecues,"Soft drink, beer and wine – the top tipples to enjoy outside with grilled food Gaffel Kölsch, Cologne, Germany (£2.32, 50cl, Beers of Europe ) Even with the pubs opening this weekend, the barbecue still feels like one of the safer ways to socialise at the moment. And the call of the grill is all the stronger when the weather is doing its best to persuade us to eat outside. What to drink alfresco? As anyone from Hank Hill to Homer Simpson would tell you, no barbecue is truly worthy of the name without some beer to hand – and, for the person behind the grill, in hand. I imagine the closest thing to fictional Alamo or Duff would be a Bud, and there’s something to be said for lightness and refreshment as you’re turning the sausages. But, to my mind, few drinks fulfil this role better than the pristine, refreshing Kölsch style of lager from Cologne, of which Gaffel is a classic example. Fentiman’s Dandelion & Burdock, Kent, UK (£2.89, 75cl, Asda ) The other key drink at every barbecue I’ve been to in the States has been Coca-Cola: not just as a soft alternative to all the beer, but as a marinade ingredient for brilliantly sticky pork ribs.",ALG,en,The Guardian

Costco's travel system looks through deals from a variety of major car rental companies, including Avis and Alamo, then applies a membership discount to the best deal. Even though I've found cheaper rentals on Priceline, I prefer Costco because I always know which company I'm renting from (unlike with Priceline), Costco has the best customer service, and I get car rental insurance for free when I use my Costco Anywhere Visa. You can use the Costco Anywhere Visa® Card by Citi to earn 2% back on eligible in-store and online purchases. Most people use Costco to buy toilet paper, snack foods , and meat in bulk. While my husband and I are among those who use Costco to stock up on our favorite household and grocery items at a lower cost , we also love one of its lesser-known benefits: car rentals . My husband gets discounts on car rentals through his employer, but even with that perk, renting a car through Costco is typically cheaper.",ALG,en,Business Insider

I still do a ton of my shopping at Costco, and there are five reasons I especially love the store. Costco has great travel deals, stylish clothes, affordable vaccinations, and delicious cooked food options. And the Costco Anywhere Visa is also my favorite cash back card. You can use the Costco Anywhere Visa® Card by Citi to earn 2% back on eligible in-store and online Costco purchases. If you know anything about me, you know I'd bleed for Costco. As a native of the Pacific Northwest (Costco's motherland) I grew up on Costco pizza and Saturday Sample Days. My parents still go to Costco for no specific reason, but rather to browse (and maybe buy bananas for my dad's protein shakes). We're a Costco family , and the price of a $60 annual membership (that I split with my grandma) is absolutely worth it. Beyond just the jumbo packs of toilet paper, huge bagged salads, and oversized boxes of La Croix, here are five things you might not know you can use your Costco membership for.

Humans are rarely offered a glimpse into the raw, unfiltered world of the animal kingdom.

2019-07-28 11:16:35-05:00,The small Nevada town near Area 51 is struggling to prepare for the upcoming 'storm',"LAS VEGAS (AP) — At first, the co-owner of the quirky alien-themed motel down a Nevada highway from the mysterious Area 51 site didn't take a posting for a prank Facebook event too seriously. Then, her phone started ringing. ""It doesn't stop, our phone won't stop ringing,"" Connie West, of the Little A'le'Inn, told the Las Vegas Sun. The 10-room motel is one of few businesses in Rachel, a town of 54 residents now gaining celebrity status among aviation and UFO enthusiasts attracted by the posting about a Sept. 20 event dubbed ""storm Area 51."" More than 1 million people have responded to the internet post calling for people to ""Naruto run"" at 3 a.m. into the remote U.S. Air Force test area in the Nevada desert that has long been the focus of UFO conspiracy theories. The face-forward, arms-back running style is favored by characters in the anime series ""Naruto."" ""They can't stop all of us,"" the post jokes. ""Lets see them aliens."" The military is warning people not to try to enter the once top-secret Cold War site, which is posted and patrolled as part of the vast Nevada Test and Training Range.",ALG,en,Business Insider

My wife and I love credit card rewards. It's like a game for us to see how little we can spend on travel by using cards that earn us bonus points. Recently, my wife and I were able to use credit card rewards to take a week-long vacation to Texas and back (from Florida) for less than $500 out of pocket.
