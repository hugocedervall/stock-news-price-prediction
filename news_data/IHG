New data from London-based equity research firm Ortex Analytics shows almost three-quarters of total short losses in August came from big wagers against just five names: Ocado Group, InterContinental Hotels, International Consolidated Airlines Group, BHP and Pearson. Together, they accounted for a bruising GBP310 million loss out of a total hit of GBP420 million to hedge fund short sellers last month. As UK equities gained ground towards the end of the summer, hedge funds made gains from short positions in just a third of FTSE 100 names - 32 companies out of the total 100 in the index – as negative wagers in all sectors ultimately went awry.
