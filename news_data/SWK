You have to have a contrarian mindset and exceptionally thick skin. And today, I had the pleasure of speaking with one of the all-time living greats in this space, David Tice. David is a forensic accountant with a history of sniffing out fraud and overly aggressive accounting, and he previously managed the Prudent Bear Fund In 2008, he exited the industry by selling his mutual fund business at the top (for short sellers!) just as the crisis was bottoming.

And now two European companies, polyamide supplier Domo and polymer manufacturer Covestro, are collaborating with Dutch technology startup Circularise to create a system for tracking plastics. The ultimate goal is to create an open standard for sharing data about where resins or materials originate - information that's important for moving to circular production models that help the plastics industry increase the use of recycled content and decrease the use of virgin plastic. The three companies have created a consortium dubbed Circularise Plastics to develop and pilot the system. They're encouraging other companies to become involved, and have already presented the technology to BASF and its customer Stanley Black & Decker as part of the US chemical company's Circularity Challenge accelerator program, which is run by Greentown Labs. ""Having this standard would improve transparency throughout the whole plastics value chain,"" wrote a spokesperson for Domo, in response to emailed questions. ""It will also make providing evidence of provenance for an object, as well as communication of such information as recycled content, audit reports and certificates to our customers and end consumers a lot easier.""
