2019-03-22 12:27:00-05:00,"Apple's news service just landed The Wall Street Journal (AAPL, NYT, GHC)","This is an excerpt from a story delivered exclusively to Business Insider Intelligence Digital Media Briefing subscribers. To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here . Apple has convinced The Wall Street Journal to participate in its forthcoming “ Netflix for news ” paid subscription news service, per The New York Times. Full details on the service will be announced at next Monday’s Apple event. To successfully lure paid subs to the offering, Apple needs to ensure that it signs up a sufficient number of popular publishers. The Journal, which has a succesful subscription business of its own, is a big get for the service, particularly as other prominent national papers like The New York Times and The Washington Post remain holdouts. The Times, The Post, and others reluctant to sign up are likely wary of enabling another tech giant to affect their businesses. For example, publishers have endured a fraught relationship with Facebook, which drives referral traffic to their sites, but has also sucked up digital ad dollars and offered unreliable and even damaging advice around content strategy (See: Pivot-to-video).",GHC,en,Business Insider
