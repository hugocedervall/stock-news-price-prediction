2020-12-07 12:24:18-05:00,Core Goldman Sachs Won't Flee New York for Florida,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. traces its roots back more than 150 years to 1869, when Marcus Goldman, a German immigrant, moved to New York City and opened a one-room office in a basement next to a coal chute at 30 Pine Street. Today, that address represents the heart of Manhattan’s financial district: One block north of Wall Street and one block south of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Goldman Sachs Asset Management, by contrast, was formed in 1988.This difference is important context to keep in mind after reading the scoop from Bloomberg News’s Sridhar Natarajan that Goldman is considering a new Florida hub to house its asset-management division. The news naturally set off alarms about the end of New York City as the undisputed financial capital of the U.S., given the surprise decision by AllianceBernstein Holding LP in 2018 to move its headquarters to Nashville and, more recently, the increased presence of Blackstone Group Inc. and Citadel in the Sunshine State.Make no mistake: Goldman is a powerhouse in asset management, managing $1.46 trillion as of the end of the third quarter, up 19% from a year earlier and more than Morgan Stanley’s investment management division stands to oversee even after the bank acquires Eaton Vance Corp.",EV,en,Yahoo Finance

""Asset manager M&A wave will continue with a variety of potential transactions,"" analysts at Credit Suisse led by Craig Siegenthaler wrote to clients on Thursday. The evening before, Australia-based Macquarie Group said it would acquire investment manager Waddell & Reed. Macquarie is set to buy the Overland Park, Kansas-based firm for $1.7 billion, or $2.3 billion Australian dollars, and is set to sell Waddell's wealth management business to major independent US broker-dealer LPL Financial for some $300 million once that deal closes. The plans to acquire Waddell, the parent company of Ivy Investments, which Business Insider previously reported could be sold off , sent analysts wondering which firm could be next. Credit Suisse pegged BrightSphere Investment Group, WisdomTree Investments, Janus Henderson, and Cohen & Steers as the ""likeliest sellers,"" and named Invesco and Franklin Resources as possible acquirers of other firms.",EV,en,Business Insider
2020-12-02 12:34:34-05:00,Pandemic increases need for country-specific focus in popular EM debt sector,"Pandemic increases need for country-specific focus in popular EM debt sector Submitted By Madeleine Taylor | 02/12/2020 - 5:34pm Investor appetite for emerging markets has been on the rise, boosted by hopes of a vaccine-led recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, and by Joe Biden’s victory in the US presidential election. According to a recent survey from Bank of America, half of fund managers favour emerging markets more than any other asset class for 2021. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has risen by nearly 13 per cent in November. Emerging market debt is also growing in popularity, with EPFR data showing flows of USD3.5 billion into EM bonds during one week in November, the fourth largest weekly inflows ever. “EMD remains a relatively popular asset class for institutional investors globally,” writes the emerging markets debt team of US asset manager Eaton Vance. “The irony, however, is that fund flows in the sector are still driven by index-based strategies that ignore fundamentals, even as many investors have come to recognise just how crucial individual EM country fundamentals will be in surmounting Covid-19 challenges.” Benchmark-based approaches “may be sub-optimal”, warns Eaton Vance, adding that indexes are often highly concentrated, with ten countries accounting for 80 per cent of JP Morgan’s Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets’ index weighting.",EV,en,InstitutionAlassetManager

This month, US investment bank Morgan Stanley revealed plans to buy investment manager Eaton Vance, in a move that will almost double its assets under management to USD1.2 trillion. “Eaton Vance is a perfect fit for Morgan Stanley,” said James P Gorman, chairman and chief executive officer of Morgan Stanley, at the time of the announcement. Gorman explained that Morgan Stanley sees it as an opportunity to add more fee-based revenues and boost assets under management. Bing Waldert, managing director of US research at asset management research firm Cerulli Associates, says investment managers are looking to gain greater market share as their profits come under increasing threat. “The overarching theme is continued compression of fees in the asset management marketplace,” says Waldert. “At a top line, that means the revenue that an asset manager is able to raise, but as you start to dig deeper, it's also about costs in a stricter regulatory environment.” Allocators are “looking to engage with fewer partners on a deeper level”, which means their expectations for asset manager relationships are going up, and the fees they expect to pay are going down.",EV,en,InstitutionAlassetManager
