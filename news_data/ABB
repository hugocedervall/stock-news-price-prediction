Inverter shipments also hit a record high last year, falling just short of 130 gigawatts, according to a new analysis of the inverter market from Wood Mackenzie. In addition to growing global solar installations, two factors propelled the inverter market to record highs in 2019: The rush to secure solar equipment before the stepdown of the US investment tax credit (ITC) from 30 percent to 26 percent and the growing inverter replacement market in Europe. While solar PV modules were developers’ first choice to qualify for the ITC, they also chose to safe harbor PV inverters, albeit at a lesser rate. In 2019, between 25 and 30 percent of US PV inverter shipments were for safe harboring purposes. Developers chose to safe harbor inverters for a few reasons. Firstly, while modules made significant efficiency gains over the last several years, with more improvements on the horizon, inverters are not likely to make such gains in the near term, and so are perceived to have a lower technology risk than modules.",ABB,en,Green Technology Media

The oil major announced on Friday that a feasibility study was underway for a huge green hydrogen operation. This would then be converted into ""green ammonia"" and exported internationally. A pilot phase would produce 20 kilotons annually (ktpa) with the full-scale commercial operation producing 1,000ktpa of green ammonia.

Ammonia is cheaper to store than hydrogen and, given its widespread use in fertilizers, it already has a large supply chain in place. “We believe that green hydrogen will play an increasingly important role, not only as a new, clean energy vector, but also in enabling the further growth of renewable power,” Dev Sanyal, executive VP of BP’s gas and low carbon business, said in a statement. “This aligns with BP’s ambition to support the world’s decarbonization agenda.” In February BP announced a net zero by 2050 ambition in February, and said it would release more details in September.",ABB,en,Green Technology

The Series B funding round was led by existing investor BP Ventures and attracted new investors ABB Technology Ventures and Energy Innovation Capital as well as a number of other financial and strategic investors, including Silicon Valley Bank. California-based FreeWire specialises in EV charging technology it claims can support ultrafast EV charging without the need for new grid infrastructure investments, thereby saving customers up to 40 per cent on installation costs. The fresh funding injection will go towards launching a new battery-integrated charging product dubbed the ‘Boost Charger', which is designed to draw less power from the grid in order to cut costs for retail customers, the firm said.",ABB,en,BusinessGreen

The Bay Area company finished development of its Boost Charger, which delivers fast charging (up to 120 kilowatt output) while minimizing stress on the local power grid with the help of a built-in 160 kilowatt-hour battery. That storage capacity allows fast charging while lowering the instantaneous pull from the grid to resemble a Level 2 charger (roughly 10 kilowatts), which in turn reduces costly grid upgrades required to install the system in the first place. These permitting and infrastructure upgrade savings can drive total system installation costs 25 to 40 percent lower than an equivalent fast charger, despite the extra cost of the batteries, CEO Arcady Sosinov said. ""Consumers want faster and faster charging, and its harder and harder to keep up with it from the infrastructure perspective,"" he said.

2020-02-24 14:28:00-05:00,Solar Repowering Could Be Coming Sooner Than You Think,"Solar technology is getting better and cheaper. That winning combination means that many of the oldest projects in the global solar fleet may be set for a facelift. Throw in sunsetting subsidies, worthless warranties and a smattering of poorly built projects, and repowering and revamping (the latter involves changes that don’t increase capacity) will be an obvious choice for many developers in the years ahead, creating a big new subsector of the global solar industry. More than 67 gigawatts of solar capacity will celebrate its twentieth birthday this decade, according to Wood Mackenzie. A large chunk of that capacity is in the European market, where solar repowering and revamping is taking off first. In the U.K. and Germany, projects lose their subsidy support once they reach 20 years of age. Bad builds and bankruptcies Several factors have driven the repowering and revamping seen to date in the market, starting with the so-called ""negative incentive."" Many solar plants built in Europe before 2013 were rushed to completion to meet a feed-in tariff deadline, leaving a number of them ""distressed and malfunctioning,"" said Hannes Langenhan, a PV repowering expert with the developer and O&M firm BayWa r.e.",ABB,en,Green Technology

2019-12-12 06:45:51-05:00,"One More Time, With Feeling: GE’s Latest Approach to Energy Storage","Century-old electric technology company GE kicked off 2019 with yet another reorg. The workhorse Power division was splitting up. Though still a top supplier of the world's natural gas turbines, it had turned into a money-loser as renewable adoption surged. Meanwhile, an expanded Renewable Energy division materialized with some 40,000 employees and billions of dollars in revenue. And GE's up-and-coming energy storage business took up residence in that new division under the Renewable Energy Hybrids brand. Previously, storage had nestled under Power, and before that it lived in the ill-fated Current unit, catering to commercial energy services. Years earlier GE tried and then abandoned a sodium-nickel-chloride battery manufacturing play called Durathon. As the first year under the new arrangement drew to a close, GTM sat down with GE Renewable Energy Hybrid Solutions CEO Prakash Chandra to hear how the industrial giant is leveraging energy storage to grapple with a changing energy market. “There's never been a lack of commitment to storage,"" Chandra said. ""I think we've tried to muddle through what is the best way to play in the space so we can add the most value in the entire value chain of storage.” The Durathon effort, which looks quixotic from today's perspective, developed as an effort to turn GE locomotives into diesel electric hybrids.",ABB,en,Green Technology
