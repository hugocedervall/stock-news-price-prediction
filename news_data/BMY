Once outbreaks became severe in the US, consumers began flocking to telehealth: Telehealth usage among US adults climbed 6 percentage points month-over-month from February 2020 — when 11% of respondents reported having tried telehealth — to March — when 17% said the same, per a survey by CivicScience.",BMY,en,Business Insider

US regulators approved the virus-fighting drug remdesivir on Thursday, greenlighting its use in hospitalized patients. The US Food and Drug Administration had given an emergency OK for the drug's use in May. But it's unclear how well remdesivir, marketed as Veklury, works for patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Studies respectively led by the US National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization came to conflicting conclusions, with the WHO research casting doubt on the drug's benefits. ""It has an effect, but it doesn't really have an amazing effect that people were hoping it would have,"" Dr. Walid Gellad, director for the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing at the University of Pittsburgh, told Business Insider in a Friday phone interview. In squaring the findings of the main studies on remdesivir, longtime drug discovery researcher Derek Lowe wrote that ""for remdesivir, it looks like the argument now is 'Does it help a bit or just not at all?'""

The coronavirus pandemic has been a watershed moment for telehealth — or the use of mobile technology to deliver health-related services, such as remote doctor consultations and patient monitoring — as patients have had to reimagine the ways they seek healthcare. While telehealth has been on the brink of taking off for years, consumer usage of the tech ticked up slowly before 2020. The coronavirus pandemic has given consumers the push they need to adopt telemedicine on a wide scale — and we expect adoption to keep climbing so long as the pandemic rages on. Once outbreaks became severe in the US, consumers began flocking to telehealth: Telehealth usage among US adults climbed 6 percentage points month-over-month from February 2020 — when 11% of respondents reported having tried telehealth — to March — when 17% said the same, per a survey by CivicScience.","BMY,BOE",en,Business Insider

Over the past few days, the president confirmed his diagnosis, was injected with an experimental antibody cocktail, transported to Walter Reed Medical Center, and given an IV infusion of the antiviral drug remdesivir.",BMY,en,Business Insider

Katie Porter grilled Celgene CEO Mark Alles Wednesday over price hikes on a cancer drug, which she said resulted in a half-million bonus for the pharma executive. Alles appeared before the House Oversight Committee alongside the CEOs of Teva and Bristol-Myers Squibb as part of a House investigation into the pricing of Teva's Multiple Sclerosis drug Copaxone and Bristol-Myers Squibb's multiple myeloma drug Revlimid. Alles served as CEO of Celgene before it was acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb in 2019. ""Since launching Revlimid in 2005, Celgene raised the price of the drug 22 times, from $215 per pill to $719 per pill,"" according to documents from House Oversight Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney . ""After Bristol Myers Squibb obtained the rights to Revlimid last November, it raised the price of Revlimid again, to $763 per pill. Due to these price increases, a monthly course of Revlimid is priced at $16,023 today — more than triple the 2005 price."" During the congressional hearing Wednesday, Porter, a former consumer protection attorney, tore into Alles, writing key figures in her questions — such as how much the CEO makes, how much a single pill of Revlimid cost over the years, and how much his bonus was as a result — on a whiteboard to striking effect.
