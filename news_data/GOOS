More details from Bloomberg: Credit Suisse, which acted as underwriter on the sale of 10 million shares by Canada Goose Holdings Inc. stockholders in late November, saw the value of the stock tumble after the arrest of Huawei Technologies Co’s finance chief in Canada prompted a diplomatic dispute between the two countries, the people said, asking to not to be identified as the loss isn’t public.",GOOS,en,Zero Hedge
