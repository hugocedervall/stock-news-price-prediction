The sale will help HNA Technology, a listed arm of the group, to repay the principal and interest on M&A loans and related debt, as well as to reduce expenses and ease liquidity pressure, the unit said in a regulatory filing with the Shanghai Stock Exchange.",GS,en,The Sun Daily

Spurred on by consumer frustrations with incumbents and growing willingness to use digital channels for accessing financial services, these tech-savvy players have acquired customers at pace and ramped up pressure on established firms. In the US, these challengers got off to a slower start than elsewhere, especially compared with Europe. But they've begun gaining traction in the last year.

2020-12-01 09:22:41-05:00,Airbnb Aims for About $35 Billion Value in Long-Awaited IPO,"(Bloomberg) -- Airbnb Inc. and existing investors are seeking to raise as much as $2.6 billion in a long-awaited initial public offering expected to cap one of the busiest years ever for U.S. listings.The home-rental platform and some shareholders are offering 51.9 million shares at $44 to $50 apiece, San Francisco-based Airbnb said in a filing Tuesday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.The filing also addresses the key question of Airbnb’s valuation as a public company. It would have a fully diluted market value of nearly $35 billion at the top end of the indicative range. That figure includes employee stock options as well as restricted share units.Airbnb’s highest valuation as a private company was $31 billion in a funding round in 2017. Warrants in an April round of debt and equity securities that included Silver Lake and Sixth Street Partners valued the company at only $18 billion, Bloomberg News has reported.The company’s IPO valuation and price range could still change depending on demand for its stock on its roadshow with investors over the next week or so.The company is currently planning to price its IPO on Dec. 9 and for its shares to begin trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market the following day, said a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private information.",GS,en,Yahoo Finance

Viswanathan previously served as the bank's chief administrative officer overseeing technology and operations in corporate and investment banking. Talks of Chase's UK venture started in August, and while the bank hasn't commented on its UK plans, both this key appointment and Financial Conduct Authority filings indicate that it remains in progress. This will be Chase's second attempt at a digital-only offshoot after shuttering its Finn app in the US last year. The millennial-geared service was discontinued in June 2019, just a year after its national rollout. Finn failed to differentiate its offerings from Chase's flagship mobile app enough to attract its own audience: It was built on top of the same backend infrastructure as the bank's main mobile banking app, and the two looked very similar. Chase doesn't have a presence in the UK yet, so it won't run into that issue with its new endeavor—though it also won't have strong brand recognition to fall back on.",GS,en,Business Insider

2020-11-13 11:17:20-05:00,Biden is tapping a former CFTC chair to lead the transition for bank regulation. Lawyers and former regulators share what his tough approach could mean for Wall Street.,"Summary List Placement Regulatory veteran Gary Gensler has officially been tapped by President-elect Joe Biden to lead his financial policy transition team. A large responsibility of Gensler's new role will be to oversee Wall Street and the regulations that govern it. The appointment was announced by the Biden campaign on Tuesday, after initial reports of the expected move the previous Friday. As part of Biden's transition team, Gensler will be leading an effort to review the Federal Reserve and banking and securities regulators, according to Bloomberg. Gensler, who spearheaded watchdog efforts as chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates the United States' derivatives markets, during the Obama administration, will likely knuckle down on financial and consumer protection policies, four securities lawyers, some of whom are former regulators, told Business Insider. At the same time, given his Wall Street roots, Gensler's tough approach could be, at the very least, acknowledged by banks who recognize him as one of their own — even as he ""ruffled a lot of feathers"" by imposing strict rules in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, per one expert — and ultimately lead to the development of a healthier market.",GS,en,Business Insider

The elite Wall Street bank announced its 2020 partner class on Thursday — and seven of the 19 investment bankers elevated to partner status came from the bank's technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) group. On the whole, Goldman elevated 60 people to partner status, which brings the total number of partners at the elite Wall Street firm to fewer than 440, a reduction in the historical partner class size, which reflects CEO David Solomon's efforts to tighten the pool on the partner class and make it more exclusive. Read more: Goldman Sachs just dropped the names of its 2020 partner class, and it's a big day for investment bankers in TMT Nick Pomponi, a co-head of global software investment banking, told Business Insider that the number of TMT partners elevated on Thursday demonstrates the value that the firm places on its tech practice. ""I think it just really demonstrates the investment that Goldman is putting into our technology practices, and our team broadly,"" Pomponi said, adding that it's also a nod toward ""how busy we all expect to be over the years to come.""

Although the Democrats could still win a slim majority in the Senate - with January's two run-off elections in Georgia - the consensus is that it's going to go the Republicans' way. So, what does that mean for the stimulus package which the American economy is in need of? Ultimately, its fate lies with the one person more powerful than the President-elect themselves - Republican Senator, and presumptive Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell - says Sam Solem, portfolio manager at Intrepid Capital. With the power over the size and scope of any stimulus package Mitch McConnell has the ability to place the 'McConnell Cap' on any of Biden's plans, giving him the higher ground in any negotiations on economic and fiscal stimulus. ""I think the Senate is the most important part of the United States branch of government, and that's what we've been telling clients for the past few months,"" he said. ""Congress holds the spending power, it appropriates money… any tax policy, any legislation has to go through the Senate and so that's why this split government is a big deal.""

Instead, it started with a relative newcomer to his inner circle, a former Deutsche Bank AG trader with a background in financial engineering.Akshay Naheta, not yet 40, has worked on some of SoftBank Group Corp.’s biggest deals since joining the company three years ago. Some, like a $1 billion debt transaction with Wirecard AG, have been controversial. But they got him close enough to Son that he was able to pitch him on the sale of Arm to semiconductor designer Nvidia Corp.Naheta’s rise at SoftBank -- he’s now a senior vice president, providing strategic advice to Son -- reflects the company’s move away from running technology businesses to an investment-holdings model where finance veterans with an appetite for risk and complexity hold sway.

Crisis yes, maybe even a touch of market turmoil for a few weeks in March, but never something that would embroil the world’s mightiest financial institutions, the way that subprime mortgages embroiled them 12 years before. So starting in March, a series of emergency measures were rolled out that temporarily eliminated or blunted restrictions on bank balance sheets, along with ramped up support for financial markets that in the US at least, was unprecedented. Risky Finance joined forces with Washington DC-based advocacy group Americans for Financial Reform to analyze some of the impact on the six biggest US banks. Our research showed that the key limiting constraint this year for the banks has been the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), part of the 2012 Dodd-Frank Act that harmonised US bank regulation with global Basel rules.",GS,en,Zero Hedge

Tyler Durden Fri, 10/30/2020 - 11:50 Authored by Sara Carter via SaraACarter.com, The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee confirmed Wednesday the information exposed by former Hunter Biden business associate Tony Bobulinski that connects the former Vice President to companies and ventures in China. But you wouldn’t know it by following the main stream press. Bobulinski’s bombshell interview with Fox News host Tucker Carlson Tuesday, along with Carlson’s follow up exclusive on Wednesday, revealed that Democratic candidate Joe Biden was aware of his son’s business questionable overseas business dealings. It should be a huge story. After all, Joe Biden has publicly denied knowing about his son’s business ventures in China, Ukraine and other parts of the world. So why isn’t this story on the front page of every newspaper and covered by every cable network? How is it possible that the majority of main stream media outlets, newspapers and cable networks had no problem running unsubstantiated stories about President Donald Trump, his family and his businesses only to find out later – without corrections- that the information they published was bogus.",GS,en,Zero Hedge

O Dow Jones fechou em queda de 0,35%, a 28.210,82 pontos, enquanto o S&P 500 recuou 0,22%, a 3.435,56 pontos, e o Nasdaq caiu 0,28%, a 11.484,69 pontos.

I am an Enemy to all banks discounting bills, or notes for anything but Coin. If the American People allow private banks to control the issuance of their currency, first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the People of all their Property until their Children will wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered.” – Thomas Jefferson. (1743-1826). If we look at just one example of “depriving the People of their Property” as Jefferson stated, the consequences for the ordinary man are devastating. According to Federal Reserve Data, the richest 59 Americans have a wealth of $2 trillion which is the same as the wealth of poorest 50% or 165 million people.",GS,en,Zero Hedge

JPMorgan Chase, for example, is already investing in quantum computing despite the tech being years away from robust commercial use and Bank of America and Nasdaq were well into their cloud migrations before this year, only to have the projects validated by the coronavirus pandemic. HSBC also expanded its cloud investments during the outbreak. While others remain skeptical out of fear of housing sensitive client data in public servers, among other concerns, those that did make the investments may have had an easier time pivoting after the pandemic forced them to require employees to work from home — including call center workers . Amazon Web Services managing director Scott Mullins said that the pandemic has also created a record-breaking volume of trading for its Wall Street customers, which AWS supported through enabling them to quickly scale their services to ""peak processing demands at a moment's notice."" Nasdaq, for example, tapped AWS to reduce the amount of time it took to bill clients at the end of the day from 40 minutes to four minutes — a particularly beneficial improvement when factoring in the increased trading volume over the past few months, according to Mullins.",GS,en,Business Insider

But after the industry sharpened its knives, sending a letter to lawmakers warning that the tax would ultimately be passed on to consumers, effectively creating one more tax on retirees and other savers, while also ultimately lowering the total tax take for the state of New Jersey, it appears they have capitulated. According to Bloomberg , NJ lawmakers have scaled back the proposed fee in a bid to overcome opposition from financial firms, which have threatened to leave the state, a tactic familiar to the super-wealthy ( unless you're David Tepper ).

The size – and scope – of that arrangement could extend into a mid-size motorcycle project (for 300-500 cc vehicles) in three to five years. That will enable Hero to enter the premium end of the home market, while Harley can take a stab at the segment now dominated by Royal Enfield.ET learns that Hero is being advised by Goldman Sachs on the proposed partnership. Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the queries. In response to ET’s query, Hero Motocorp said it does not comment on market speculation.

In so doing, the SEC is dampening an important risk signal to corporate management and investors, especially with respect to environmental, social and governance issues. The change appears to have been heavily influenced by a network of corporate oil and gas interests, and is likely to be contested in court. First, some background. Shareholders in publicly traded companies have the right to vote on certain corporate matters.

O banco Goldman Sachs reduziu a previsão de crescimento da economia americana no quarto trimestre de 6% para 3% em relação ao trimestre anterior. “Achamos que agora está claro que o Congresso não anexará estímulo fiscal adicional à resolução contínua”, afirmam em relatório os analistas do Goldman Sachs liderados pelo economista-chefe Jan Hatzius. A resolução contínua que eles citam se refere à lei para prorrogar o financiamento do governo americano até 11 de dezembro e na qual os republicanos queriam incluir medidas de alívio fiscal.

The move would make Array, which would trade under the ticker ARRY, the second largest publicly-owned tracker company in the world in terms of shipments. Array did not respond to request for comment on when it expects to launch the IPO. Trackers, which allow solar panels to follow the sun and absorb more light, are becoming increasingly common on large-scale solar installations worldwide. In the next five years, Wood Mackenzie anticipates the market will grow by 45 percent. Their use is becoming especially common in the U.S., which made up half of global shipments last year, in part due to the safe harboring provision of the Investment Tax Credit. That allows developers and EPCs to buy up equipment to use in later installations, thus ensuring projects can capture the tax credit with less dependance on construction dates.",GS,en,Green Technology Media

But increasingly, early-stage companies, especially those in fintech and healthtech, are actually building products and platforms for the very institutions they're supposedly competing against. For incumbents, working with startups can often prove more efficient and cost effective than building new tech in-house. And for startups, nabbing deals with enterprise customers — like the world's biggest banks — can mean massive growth. But winning deals with big companies is more than just a compelling sales pitch, especially in regulated industries like finance and healthcare. The deal isn't done until due diligence is completed, and that process can take several months to work through. See more: JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are finally beginning to embrace fintech startups.

De acordo com a instituição financeira, a maior probabilidade de uma vacina ser distribuída em massa no início do ano que vem e uma recuperação adicional nas estimativas de lucro das empresas americanas devem recolocar o índice amplo de ações dos EUA em 3.600 pontos até o fim do ano, e em 3.800 pontos até o meio de 2021. Segundo o Goldman Sachs, a probabilidade de uma vacina ser distribuída em massa para a população americana no primeiro trimestre do ano que vem subiu de 40% nas últimas três semanas para 70% atualmente. Isso implica que o Produto Interno Bruto (PIB) americano deve crescer mais do que esperam analistas em Wall Street em 2021, de acordo com a instituição, o que deve contribuir para os ganhos no mercado acionário.

From in-store layaway to store-branded credit cards, retailers have always used financing as a way to convert browsers to buyers. But over the last several years, a cohort of fintechs have cropped up offering a new way for retailers to boost sales: buy now, pay later. From no-interest, two-week installment plans to longer-term financing, fintechs like Affirm, Afterpay, and Klarna, to name a few, have won over millions of consumers and tens of thousands of retailers with their digital-forward, easy-to-use alternatives to credit cards. It's no secret that e-commerce is on the rise with continued growth year-over-year for the last decade. And like other digitally-driven trends, the coronavirus pandemic has only accelerated growth in the e-commerce segment. In 2019, e-commerce accounted for 11% of total retail sales in the US. In 2020, total retail sales have been down, but in the second quarter this year, with brick-and-mortar retail largely shut down, e-commerce grew to 16% of total retail sales, reflecting a 44% increase quarter-over-quarter, according to the US Census Bureau .",GS,en,Business Insider

The rapid dealmaking has put it on a par with Japan's SoftBank and US-based Tiger Global Management & DST Global, who have poured billions into the country since 2014, backing multiple startups as India emerged as the hottest investment market in the world.The move also indicates that India has prominently figured on the radar of the relatively media-shy Silver Lake, which does not have a direct presence in the country, and it has just been waiting for the right time.

O euro se valorizou cerca de 12% desde que a turbulência trazida pelo coronavírus abalou os mercados em março, sustentado pelas medidas implementadas pela União Europeia e pela expectativa de que o banco central americano (Federal Reserve) manterá os juros nas mínimas que enfraquecem o dólar. Fundos de hedge agora apostam em outro salto da taxa de câmbio para US$ 1,25 por euro após as eleições nos EUA, nível também previsto pelo Goldman Sachs Group. As negociações no mercado de opções fizeram deste mês o agosto de maior otimismo com o euro até hoje. O movimento é parte de uma tendência mais ampla que levou estrategistas da Mizuho International a conferir ao euro o título de rei das moedas — um elogio normalmente reservado ao dólar — à medida que a incerteza em torno da eleição presidencial dos EUA em novembro reforça o interesse por ativos europeus. “Há tempo de sobra para o tema Rei Euro”, disse Peter Chatwell, chefe de estratégia multiativos da Mizuho. “Ele pode competir com o dólar para ser a moeda ocidental de escolha para fins comerciais e pode competir de forma mais geral com outras moedas consideradas seguras por ser reserva confiável de capital no longo prazo.” O dólar caiu para o menor patamar em dois anos após o presidente do Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, permitir inflação mais elevada nos EUA.",GS,pt,Valor Econômico

The unsealed filings show how Bridgewater tried to stop Tekmerion, founded in 2017 by Bridgewater alumni Lawrence Minicone and Zach Squire, with claims of intellectual property theft and broken confidentiality contracts. One of the biggest focuses for Bridgewater in a 2017 arbitration filing was that Tekmerion's 53-page pitch deck for potential investors ""closely resembled"" Bridgewater's own. Business Insider pulled out the five slides from the pitchdeck Bridgewater highlighted in the 2017 filing.

A report on its five-year study, The Power of Culture, stresses the importance of trust between asset owners and asset managers, and indicates that this has been weakened by poor culture within investment firms. This has led to a high turnover of manager mandates, as well as active manager roles dwindling because asset owners are choosing to allocate to passive mandates, in-house mandates, and smart betas. The Thinking Ahead Institute says the “obsessive pre-occupation with investment performance over short-term periods” is not helping managers produce sustainable value.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), on Tuesday night won her Democratic primary in New York’s 14th District, defeating challenger Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, a former anchor for CNBC. Progressive freshman lawmaker Ocasio-Cortez, who became the youngest woman ever to serve in Congress in the United States in 2018, brought a huge campaign war chest and a national profile to her bid for a second term in her diverse district encompassing parts of the Bronx and Queens in New York City. She won some 70 percent of the vote.

Failing that, the media will pigeonhole it as an abstract expression that has no defined definition. The truth is that the reason the media does not want to engage with the concept of globalism is precisely because it can be defined to both institutions and the individuals that inhabit them. To illustrate this, let’s use the Trilateral Commission as a specific example. I last wrote about the Trilateral Commission in February when I discussed how the organisation was in the process of reforming itself. Back in the summer of 2019, they published a brochure called ‘ Democracies Under Stress: Recreating the Trilateral Commission to Revitalize Our Democracies to Uphold the Rules-Based International Order ‘.",GS,en,Zero Hedge

""It was the bridge we needed to get us through a rough time,"" the motorcycle maker's finance chief said in 2014. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway probably netted about $150 million in profit from the five-year loan, but could have made more than $1 billion if it had invested $300 million in Harley-Davidson stock over the same period.

And Federal Reserve policymakers made clear they expect to hold interest rates near-zero through 2022 — and that they see a long path to an economic recovery. Major US stock indexes logged their biggest one-day loss since since mid-March on Thursday before clawing back some ground in volatile trading the next day.

In the US, these challengers got off to a slower start than elsewhere, especially compared with Europe. But they've begun gaining traction in the last year. One of the most unique players at the forefront of this disruption, though, is challenger brand Marcus, launched not by a startup, but by Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs. To understand why Goldman launched Marcus and how it's disrupting retail banking in the US, Business Insider Intelligence spoke with Omer Ismail, US head of consumer digital finance in the Americas for Goldman Sachs.

2020-06-04 08:34:00-05:00,Bitcoin Is a Paradigm Shift Beyond Wall Street,"A former Goldman Sachs vice president of investment banking: “We should be glad that traditional Wall Street hasn’t come around to embrace crypto yet.” When the Goldman Sachs report came out dismissing Bitcoin’s status as an asset class , there was significant backlash from the crypto community. This is understandable, as for those building in crypto, the points against Bitcoin didn’t make sense. For nearly a decade of my career, I was a banker at Goldman, but decided to leave Wall Street to join an incredible group of people at OKCoin, who are on a mission to make crypto trading easy and accessible for everyone around the world. Having been on both sides, I can appreciate why Goldman Sachs analysts made certain arguments in their recent position. I may not agree with it, but I fundamentally believe that being open to different perspectives is critical to building the right crypto ecosystems that can lead us to mass consumerization. Emerging asset classes take time to gain recognition Goldman analysts argue that “Bitcoin is not an asset class.” Insert “traditional” in their statement and we get closer to reality.",GS,en,Cointelegraph

2020-06-04 06:16:01-05:00,View: It’s always sunny in India’s renewable power market,"By Nathaniel BullardIndia is the world’s biggest market for renewable energy auctions, in which wind and solar project developers compete to offer the lowest possible prices for zero-carbon power. Last month, the country added a twist: a call for “round-the-clock” renewable power. The winning bid was higher than the going rates for wind and solar in previous auctions. But it was also lower than what it would cost to meet peak demand with coal-fired power in some India markets.It’s worth unpacking the mechanics of India's round-the-clock renewables plan, beginning with what “round-the-clock” actually means. It’s not 24-7 renewable power generation from one project; rather, it’s a requirement to provide 400 megawatts of renewable power at least 80% of the time over the course of the year, and at least 70% of the time in any given month.Wind and solar are India’s cheapest sources of renewable power, but those 70-80% capacity factor requirements are impossible to meet with one wind or solar project on its own, for two reasons.",GS,en,Economic Times India

We find all of that surprising, because while Bloomberg is right and neither earnings, nor economics, nor valuation matter, what does matter is what Bill Dudley finally admitted to today, namely that the Fed is "" basically creating a little bit of moral hazard "" and since moral hazard is a binary condition - it is either there or it isn't - what happened is that as Scott Minerd said, the Fed "" sent the world a buy signal "" and the world responded as requested.

Behind the scenes, however, the Treasury’s responsibilities have fallen largely to the 42-year-old deputy secretary, Justin Muzinich. A major beneficiary of that bailout so far: Muzinich & Co., the asset manager founded by his father where Justin served as president before joining the administration. He reported owning a stake worth at least $60 million when he entered government in 2017. Today, Muzinich retains financial ties to the firm through an opaque transaction in which he transferred his shares in the privately held company to his father. Ethics experts say the arrangement is troubling because his father received the shares for no money up front, and it appears possible that Muzinich can simply get his stake back after leaving government.",GS,en,Zero Hedge

The Vision Fund lost 1.9 trillion yen in the period, triggering the worst loss ever in the Japanese company’s 39-year history.SoftBank had to write down the valuations of companies like WeWork and Uber Technologies Inc. because of business missteps and the coronavirus fallout. Its return on the fund was negative 6%, compared with 62% just a year ago. Still, Misra was SoftBank’s second-highest-paid executive last year after Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure, even though Misra received no bonus and most of his compensation was in base pay. Founder Masayoshi Son took a 9% compensation cut, earning 209 million yen.“What kind of message is Son sending by giving Misra a raise despite the disastrous results he delivered?” said Atul Goyal, senior analyst at Jefferies Group. “The optics is just not good.”The pay hike for Misra comes at a time when the Vision Fund is planning deep cuts in staffing.",GS,en,Economic Times India

""There's been a flood of people. You have people coming to us saying, 'I'm a month or two away from foreclosure. What's it going to take to get it sold now?'"" Hague said.

This, of course, shouldn't come as much of a surprise to anyone who closely followed Apple and Samsung's blockbuster patent battle a few years ago.

2020-05-05 15:48:00-05:00,5 Reasons Why Institutional Investors Refuse to Join the Crypto Sector,"Crypto investors have long believed that institutional investors would lead to the next Bitcoin moon event but this is a false narrative built on nothing more than hope. For the past two years, crypto-media outlets and Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocates have placed heavy emphasis on the need for institutional investors to embrace the cryptocurrency sector. The oft-stated belief was that institutional inflow would lead to mass adoption and an incredible spike in the value of crypto-assets as a whole. Fast forward to the present, and the total cryptocurrency market capitalization has yet to reach the $750 billion all-time high seen in late 2017. The slow recovery of crypto prices raises a few hard to answer questions. If institutional funds have been flowing into cryptocurrencies, why hasn’t there been a significant price increase over the last three years? Either there is an almost infinite sell pressure — which shouldn’t be a barrier considering the total crypto market cap is just $248 billion — or this theory that institutional investment will pump crypto prices does not hold.",GS,en,Cointelegraph

The questions range from what happens to dividends among oil majors to how much a barrel needs to cost for the industry to survive. Visit Markets Insider to view the latest on oil prices. For the first time in history, the price of US crude oil went negative, dipping deep into the red to settle at negative $37.63 per barrel on Monday evening — meaning, oil traders were actually paying buyers to take oil off their hands. A market quirk ultimately pushed the prices into the negative double-digits. The crude price that went negative was for oil to be delivered in May.",GS,en,Business Insider

Submitted By Karin Wasteson | 21/04/2020 - 5:20pm With a recession more severe than the downturn caused by the global financial crisis of 2008 – and perhaps even the Great Depression – looming large, the temptation to look to the past for clues as to how the coronavirus crisis will play out is understandable. But while the past can provide pointers to the future, it's also worth noting that the current situation is unique in so far as it is the result of an orchestrated governmental shutdown of large sections of the global economy, rather than any financial failing. According to a recent IMF forecast, the global economy is projected to contract by 3 per cent - which is a sharper downturn than during the 2008–09 financial crisis. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs has estimated that developed economies will contract by around 35 per cent in Q1 2020 – four times the 2008 financial crisis low. American financier George Soros, founder and chair of the Open Society Foundations, presented a challenge to economists and politicians everywhere recently, when he said that we “missed the opportunity to create a more just economy after the financial crisis of 2008 and provide a social safety net for the workers who are the heart of our societies.” Soros added: “Today, we must change direction and ask ourselves: What kind of world will emerge from this catastrophe, and what can we do to make it a better one?” Troy Pospisil, CEO of legal processing platform InCloudCounsel, points to the fact that prior to this crisis, no one had considered the possibility of revenue declining 50-100 per cent within a matter of weeks. “Now that this scenario has presented itself as a reasonable outcome across many industries, there will likely be a number of ripple effects on how companies are managed and deals are structured,” he says.",GS,en,privateequitywire.co.uk

2020-04-08 14:02:47-05:00,7 Best Growth ETFs to Reap the Recovery's Rewards,"NHL Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky used to say, ""I skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it has been."" During these trying times, these are wise words. As it applies to growth stocks, you'll want to consider where these companies are going to be in six, 12 and 18 months. Easier said than done. It's impossible to know exactly where companies are going to be once the coronavirus finally dissipates. And that's what makes growth exchange-traded funds (ETFs) so appealing right now. The economy is reeling. Economists are using data to help predict when the economy will bottom, and how low that bottom will be. Some, such as Goldman Sachs, have created custom economy trackers that pull various data points together to understand where the economy is headed - and more importantly, when it will bounce back. GS believes unemployment will peak at 15%, then the economy will experience a robust recovery by the end of the year. Investors want to look ahead, not behind. But betting on individual growth stocks expected to benefit from this rapid rebound might be too risky a practice for many retail investors.",GS,en,Kiplinger Washington Editors

So, to narrow down the confusion, Goldman's clients have shifted their attention to a just a more easily answerable question: will the buybacks that helped push the market to all time highs on increasingly less volume, still be there in the coming months? The reason for the angst is the fact that, as we wrote last Sunday, Goldman's buyback desk warned that nearly 50 US companies have suspended existing share repurchase authorizations in the past two weeks, representing $190 billion of buybacks or nearly 25% of the 2019 total .There's more: as Goldman's chief equity strategist David Kostin wrote, reduced cash flows and select restrictions mandated as part of the Phase 3 fiscal legislation ""suggest more suspensions are likely.""

Not because Q2 results will necessarily be better than Q1 (they might actually be worse), but because investors tend to rely on bank CEOs for a clear perspective on the economic outlook. Executives might have a much better view of the full court in July than they do now. Like the rest of us, big bank leaders approach Q1 earnings season without a crystal ball. They don’t know how long the coronavirus emergency might last or what its eventual impact might be on their industry or on the other sectors that their lending supports. Things are likely to get rough, but how rough is the question. By its very nature, the Financial sector is one that gets a courtside seat to the broader economy. It’s the sector that sees the ebb and flow of lending and deposits—at both the business and consumer levels.

At a time when the federal government is struggling to manage its $2 trillion bailouts for main street and SMEs, a handful of Goldman Sachs insiders (probably high-ranking executives) have apparently decided to sandbag CEO David Solomon, who is already reeling from the blowback to his latest raise, the highest among his peers despite $GS's lagging performance. BBG reported Friday that Solomon recently OK'd the purchase of two private jets, breaking with a longstanding corporate tradition. For years, there was an allergy inside Goldman Sachs to owning a private corporate jet. Top bankers had access to rides on planes shared with others, but didn’t want to erode their less-than-stellar image on Main Street with the unnecessary extravagance of having their own.

Stocks and indices reached their post-crash and relief rally closing highs from March 25th through March 27th. None of the indices for the six countries has since closed above their highs. Since making their relief rally highs all eight of the indices have declined by 4.2% to 7.4%. With each new passing day that the indices are unable to get new post-crash highs, the probability increases that they will careen back to and through their March 2020 lows. Investors now need to make a decision; stay in the roller coaster or get out? From my empirical research on the prior notable market crashes in early March 2020, I discovered that the 1929 crash and the bursting of the NASDAQ dotcom bubble in 2000 share the same genealogy as the crashes of the markets of the six countries which have been underway.",GS,en,Zero Hedge

The strategy, managed by Ironshield CIO and managing partner David Nazar, targets high absolute returns by trading event driven, stressed and distressed European high yield credits across the capital structure and ratings spectrum. Nazar - who managed proprietary credit portfolios for Deutsche Bank and Bank of America before founding Ironshield in 2007 - said the fund’s UCITS format launches as the prevailing investment landscape is “reset” by the volatility spike. The portfolio comprises both long and short, liquid, single name credit positions, along with actively traded bonds, credit default swaps, and other corporate securities. “Our high alpha and low correlation return stream can be a powerful source of results for investors as well as acting as a diversifier in investors’ portfolios,” said Nazar, who also worked as an investment banker for Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers. “We are looking forward to leveraging our expertise and nimble approach to take advantage of market dislocations on behalf of our investors.” Commenting on the launch, Cyril Delamare, CEO of MontLake, whose product offering spans UCITS, alternative UCITS, hedge funds, real estate, infrastructure and private equity, said: “The fund has a unique return profile and compliments our wide array of product offerings.",GS,en,Hedgeweek

Los bancos llevan pagando intereses de penalización desde 2014, cuando estacionaron dinero en el BCE y la institución estableció una tasa de depósito de menos 0,5 por ciento.

The US has confirmed more than 9,000 cases and 165 deaths. Battling the coronavirus pandemic will be like a ""war,"" according to leaders ranging from US President Donald Trump to German Chancellor Angela Merkel to French President Emmanuel Macron. As the spread of the virus plunges the global economy into recession, governments worldwide are pledging billions to mitigate the fallout — and the US is no exception. But they'll need something more like a ""wartime economy"" to fight the pandemic and the recession at the same time. During World War II, the US government mobilized major industry for all the various needs of the war effort, with Ford making tanks, for example. This time around, Ford might make ventilators for US hospitals. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . Bill Gates has been warning for years that the next pandemic was imminent.

Davidson's Tom Forte says the impact will likely show up in future quarters as the coronavirus started affecting US businesses in the second half of this quarter. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . Amazon Web Services has been focused on signing up more large business customers in recent years, as it continues to expand beyond the tech startup community that first adopted its cloud technology.

To get this story plus others to your inbox each day, hours before they're published on Business Insider, click here. Australian neobank Xinja has decided to stop allowing customers to open new accounts, Business Insider Australia reports . The neobank's high-yield ""Stash"" savings account — which offers an impressive 2.25% rate — has seen blistering deposit growth since its launch in mid-January, amassing more than $350 million in deposits in less than two months. These skyrocketing deposits, combined with the recent decision by the Royal Bank of Australia to cut the official cash rate to a record low of 0.5%, have pressured Xinja to contain costs associated with Stash accounts, and the neobank has opted to pause new account opening in order to maintain its current interest rate. Holding its high interest rate steady could work wonders for Xinja's customer loyalty. The neobank's existing Stash customers were likely drawn to Xinja primarily because of its interest rates, which are far higher than those of incumbent banks and on par with other neobanks'.",GS,en,Business Insider

His sentiments echo those expressed by other industry leaders, such as Tiffany CEO Alessandro Bogliolo and Montblanc Creative Director Zaim Kamal , who feel the term ""luxury"" has evolved over the years. Kamal previously told Business Insider that it's now up to consumers to define what luxury means, and to find fashion houses that align with their personal values. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. Saying the word ""luxury"" is now a faux pas — at least according to some in the industry. Alexandre Arnault , the 27-year-old CEO of high-end luggage company Rimowa and son of billionaire LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault , said at a Goldman Sachs event that he's reluctant to use the word ""luxury"" to describe his brand. In the younger Arnault's view, the word luxury is ""too linked to price"" and the luxury sector has more to do with ""quality"" than it does with ""price."" ""When you think luxury, you think stores where you're going to have things you can't afford, and you're going to be scared to go inside and everything, and, to me, when you buy a Vuitton bag for $4,000, it's a lot of money, it's a luxury product,"" he said at the event, as reported by Women's Wear Daily's Sindhu Sundar . ""Those products, whether it's a $40 bottle of champagne, the $1,000 Rimowa suitcase, or the million-dollar Tiffany necklace or whatever , are made with the same level of craftsmanship, of quality, of all the things that make those products desirable,"" he continued.

De este modo, la economía española seguirá creciendo sensiblemente por encima de la media de la zona euro, cuya previsión de crecimiento ha sido recortado por Goldman Sachs hasta el 0,3% en 2020 desde el 1% estimado antes del brote del Covid-19, mientras que en 2021 la entidad confía en un rebote del crecimiento del 1,8%, frente al 1,3% proyectado anteriormente. «Ahora vemos un impacto significativamente mayor y más prolongado del brote del coronavirus en Europa, derivado de una menor demanda de exportación, una mayor interrupción de la cadena de suministro y una demanda interna más débil por infecciones locales», explica el banco estadounidense. De hecho, los analistas de Goldman Sachs anticipan que la eurozona quedará al borde la recesión al estancarse en el primer trimestre de 2020 y registrar una contracción del PIB del 0,3% en el segundo trimestre. «Seguimos esperando que el crecimiento mejore significativamente en el segundo semestre, asumiendo la contención del virus, pero ahora pensamos que llevará más tiempo», advierte la entidad, que anticipa tres trimestres consecutivos de caídas del PIB en Italia y una recesión técnica en Alemania, mientras que confía en que «Francia y España probablemente será algo más resilientes, dada su exposición más limitada al comercio global y su punto de partida más fuerte».",GS,es,ABC

The deadly coronavirus outbreak in China brought back memories of the economic repercussions from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in the early 2000s, which hit the major financial center of Hong Kong hard. Stock market sentiment also appears to have taken a dent after the International Monetary Fund reduced its forecast for 2020 global economic growth to 3.3% from the 3.4% it had previously projected. Still, the new figure would be an increase from an estimated 2.9% growth in 2019. It also seems that President Trump’s impeachment trial may be adding a layer of caution to the market.

2019-12-26 15:14:00-05:00,15 ways things have changed for billionaires in the past year,"2019 was a good year to be a billionaire — sort of. Billionaires in France , for example, saw their collective net worths soar, while the opposite happened in China. But billionaires in the US have been increasingly forced to contend with the prospect of a wealth tax . The public is also increasingly holding billionaires accountable for how they make and spend their fortunes. As we approach the end of the year — and the decade – Business Insider took a look back at how things have changed for billionaires over the course of 2019. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. Depending on where you live and how you made your fortune, 2019 was either a very good year to be a billionaire — or a very bad one. French billionaires , for example, enjoyed surges in their net worths this year, while months of mass protests and political unrest sunk those of Hong Kong's billionaires . Meanwhile, ultra-wealthy people who made their fortunes in controversial ways — no matter where they lived — were forced to deal with public reckonings amid growing income inequality.",GS,en,Business Insider

On the heels of a 2018 characterized by solid growth and poor asset performance, 2019 has delivered the reverse. Indeed, growth has slowed considerably over the past year with our global current activity indicator (CAI) currently running around 2.6% versus 3.4% on average in 2H 2018. Meanwhile, a simple US 60/40 portfolio had one of the best risk-adjusted returns since the 1960s. The strong asset performance was driven in large part by the Fed’s dovish pivot early in the year.

Authored by Andrew Moran via LibertyNation.com, It is finally about to happen! After weeks of speculation, guesses, and conspiracy theories, Saudi Aramco ’s initial public offering (IPO) is scheduled to begin trading soon. By selling just 1.5% of the company, the Saudi Arabia-owned crude oil juggernaut will receive a valuation of $1.7 trillion, which will make it the world’s largest IPO. The stock is already over-subscribed at home, but foreign investors do not have an appetite for a little bit of the crude bubbly. One reason could be IPO fatigue, especially with the kind of year the market endured. Class Of 2019 Graduates After a couple of down years for the IPO industry , it was thought that some of the hottest companies in the United States today would toss a lifejacket for investors underwater in their investments. Uber , Lyft, Pinterest, Slack, and WeWork (the office-sharing company withdrew its IPO) were supposed to save us.

Despite this, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said that he does not anticipate the Federal Reserve will implement a policy of negative interest rates as it may be detrimental to the economy. One argument against negative interest rates is that they would squeeze bank margins and create more financial uncertainty. However, upon examining the actual rate of inflation we are likely already in a ‘de facto’ negative ­­interest rate environment. Multiple inflation data sources show that actual inflation maybe 5%. With the ten year Treasury bond at 1.75%, there is an interest rate gap of – 3.25%.

But he says that rotation has been uneven, and thinks there are some discounted stocks that could register big gains if that economic improvement materializes. Kostin is looking at stocks that will have better earnings acceleration and have the potential for larger price gains than the broader market. Click here for more BI Prime stories . When the stock market turns slowly, sharp-eyed investors can find opportunities. David Kostin, the chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, says he sees signs traders are getting more optimistic about the domestic economy . That's led to gains for cyclical stocks like banks and tech hardware companies and a shift away from more defensive equities. To him, these conditions have created a distinct set of investment possibilities. ""The relative performance of Cyclicals vs. Defensives suggests the equity market is anticipating an acceleration in US economic growth during the coming months,"" he said. ""Although the equity market has started to price an acceleration in US economic growth, we believe the recent rotation has room to run."" He names four factors that can contribute to that acceleration: (1) The recent batch of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, (2) the fact that US-China tariffs shouldn't get any worse, (3) growth in inventories for US companies, and (4) the removal of some one-time obstacles like the GM workers' strike .",GS,en,Business Insider

I cannot help but wonder if that might be the case over the next few years, as the United States (and possibly the world) heads toward its next big slowdown. Downturns historically come about once every decade, and it has been more than that since the 2008 financial crisis. Back then, banks were the “too-big-to-fail” institutions responsible for our falling stock portfolios, home prices and salaries. Technology companies, by contrast, have led the market upswing over the past decade. But this time around, it is the big tech firms that could play the spoiler role.

The company's CEO went as far as to complain to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon to find out what went wrong with the listing , Business Insider reported this week. It remains to be seen how other buzzy companies will fare in the markets this year.

Colin Stewart, Morgan Stanley's lead banker on Slack's public debut, told Bloomberg we could see as many as five direct listings in 2020. To put that into context, the only two high profile direct listings in the last two years have been Slack and Spotify. Direct listings differ from typical initial public offerings in that they allow existing shareholders like early employees and investors to sell their shares quickly on the free market. The company itself doesn't raise any money and there's much less interaction with Wall Street banks, known as underwriters in a traditional IPO. Talking to a number of bankers and investors prior to Slack's public debut I was pretty skeptical that it would be a hit. This is mainly because I had always been told that direct listings could only be accomplished with well-known consumer brands (Airbnb, for example, is reportedly weighing one).",GS,en,Business Insider

2019-05-16 03:00:21-05:00,Why Trump Can’t Spin the Trade War,"(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- President Trump has spent the last few days furiously tweeting false claims about who is bearing the cost of his trade war with China. Trump insists— wrongly—that China is paying billions of dollars in tariffs, rather than U.S. consumers and businesses. Nearly every expert, including his top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, disagrees. It’s hardly the first time Trump has claimed a policy is working the way he wants it to, when empirical evidence says otherwise. He’s had some success with this tactic: Since his presidential campaign launch in 2015, for example, he’s portrayed migrants as marauding savages bent on harming Americans to justify his hardline immigration policy, when numerous studies show no causal link between immigration and crime, not even among illegal immigrants. The reason Trump’s claims resonate so powerfully with certain voters is that they don’t have any personal experience that would cause them to doubt what the president and Fox News are telling them.",GS,en,Bloomberg

ASF's effects on pigs are gruesome. Symptoms include diarrhea, depression, and miscarriages. The government is urging farmers to cull infected pigs to prevent the spread of the disease, which is in turn dramatically decreasing the country's pork production. Dutch bank Rabobank estimates that the country will kill 150 million to 200 million pigs — or one third of the country's supply — this year. China is the world's largest pork producer and consumer. The steep fall in pork production in China and likely rise in Chinese demand will likely drive up global pork prices, researchers say. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. China is expected to kill about a third of all pigs in the country this year due to an outbreak of the gruesome and incurable disease, African swine flu (ASF), which will likely drive up pork prices around the world.

The outlier: the US at just 23%. “Cash is a safe asset for a liquidity strategy but a risky one for longevity,” Paula Polito, client strategy officer at the Swiss bank’s Global Wealth Management unit, said. “We see high levels of cash globally. This is a good time for investors to consider a more diversified portfolio.” Those holdings dovetail with evidence about the rally in global equities, which shows investors have been keeping some money on the sidelines even as stocks have risen solidly in 2019.

The real crisis hitting the commodity markets is peak gold. The Financial Post reports that ""all major deposits have been discovered."" Goldman Sachs forecasts there may be only 20 years of supply left. The world's gold majors may soon be in a real estate bidding war. Mentioned in today's commentary includes: Seabridge Gold Inc. (NYSE: SA ) (TSX: SEA ), Teck Resources (NYSE: TECK ) (TSX: TECK ), Teck Resources (NYSE: TECK ) (TSX: TECK ), Great Panther Mining (NYSE: GPR ) (TSX: GPR ). Endeavor Silver (NYSE: EXK ) (TSX: EDR ). For companies like Euro Sun ( ESM , CPNFF ), this could represent a major windfall. Their Rovina Valley project in Romania is the #1 copper/gold resource in Europe - with reserves totaling 7.5 million ounces of gold and 1.5 billion pounds of copper. Rovina's previous owner - Carpathian Gold - spent $51 million sinking 138,000 meters of drill holes to prove up the potential $13.3 billion resource. It's a similar and, perhaps even better image, than that of the Timok project in neighboring Serbia, and the company that owns Timok was just snapped up for $1.4 billion .","GS,GPL",en,Benzinga

Federal Reserve policymakers see something the rest of us don’t, the thinking goes, and that’s why they have all but canceled interest-rate hikes once planned for 2019. Bond traders obviously know something stock investors are missing, so they’ve inverted the yield curve by pushing yields on 10-year Treasuries below rates on three-month bills in a classic harbinger of a recession. And will you get a load of this herd of unicorns prancing their way toward initial public offerings? Clearly their bankers have whispered in their ears, alerting them that the grass is high in public markets and now is the time to graze because a drought is coming.

2019-03-14 13:36:38-05:00,I've talked to loads of hedge funds about their performance woes and there's one thing they have in common. Here's why Excel doesn't work anymore.,"Junta Nakai has spent his career on Wall Street and in financial technology. In this op-ed, Nakai argues that Microsoft Excel, which has been used by the investment community for years, is no longer relevant for picking stocks. The explosion of alternative data in particular has pushed stock analysis beyond what Excel is capable of. Most investors are equipped for megabytes. Winners are equipped for terabytes. The vast majority of institutional investors today use Microsoft Excel as the primary tool for picking stocks. It isn’t working. During the last decade, hedge funds have underperformed a simple 60/40 equity/bond split almost every year. Hundreds of billions of dollars continue to shift from mutual funds towards passive strategies. Yet the ubiquity of spreadsheets has persisted. An objective observer might find it peculiar why the investment community does not question the utility of their bread-winning tool, despite leading many to famine. It is time for money managers to ask themselves this basic question: “What if the tools we are using are no longer appropriate for investing?” Today, ""alternative data"" is becoming more common as an incremental tool to address performance woes.",GS,en,Business Insider

As we previously noted , China has long been silent on its holdings of gold as many countries are turning away from the greenback. The value the country’s holdings of the precious metal reached US$79.5 billion, increasing by more than $3 billion compared to the end of last year. Goldman Sachs has flagged central-bank buying as a plank supporting its bullish outlook for gold, which it expects to rally to $1,400 an ounce over six months. China is also trying “to diversify its reserves” away from the greenback, according to Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at currency broker OANDA. The analyst told the South China Morning Post that the state of affairs in global politics, including a trade war with the US, are driving China’s interest to buy gold as a “safe haven hedge.” Just as we saw in 2015/2016, it appears China is reducing its US Treasury exposure as it increases its gold holdings …",GS,en,Zero Hedge

Well, heading into the end of 2017, the credit derivatives swaps of Hovnanian were soaring as if New Jersey’s largest homebuilder was about to default, even as its stocks and bonds show no signs of panic. As it subsequently turned out, the catalyst behind this divergence was a bizarre battle raging among hedge funds, with one group saying that the other has offered Hovnanian financing in return for taking steps that would trigger payouts on those derivatives.

Goldman Sachs' decision to underwrite three extremely lucrative bond offerings for doomed Malaysian Sovereign Wealth Fund 1MDB will almost certainly end up costing the bank many multiples of the $600 million in fees it generated from the deals (a high rate that Goldman justified by the exceptionally risky nature of the transactions). And though its CEO David Solomon has insisted that the scandal wasn't representative of Goldman's broader culture, revelations that senior executives - including former CEO Lloyd Blankfein - helped the bank circumvent its compliance controls and even met with a financier who is now an internally wanted fugitive have largely discredited this defense. This is just one reason why analysts at Citigroup fear that Goldman's ""tough legal setup"" amid DOJ and Malaysian investigations into the bank's involvement could lead to fines up to $9 billion, which would rank among the largest fines ever doled out to a Wall Street bank. One potential mitigating factor, according to Citi analysts Keith Horowitz and Eileen Shao, would be Goldman's ability to convince prosecutors that it has truly reformed its compliance regime since the last offering was underwritten in 2013.",GS,en,Zero Hedge

To be sure, China is still an export powerhouse - after all, it is China's massive trade surplus with the US that is arguably the reason for the ongoing trade war between the US and China. However, it is China's declining trade balance with the rest of the world that is of bigger concern in this context. As a reference, China's trade surplus has shrunk by a third in just three years : in 2015, the country exported around $150 billion worth of goods more than it imported each quarter.

It’s worth the effort in terms of education but also to reveal what’s really going on. The catalog is too long to republish here in its entirety. One of the most ridiculous anecdotes, however, was pieced together in March 2016. The dollar world was a smoldering wreck, and because of that global bond yields were still falling. Liquidity hedging was prevalent as anyone might honestly expect. As a consequence, US primary dealers were hoarding UST’s coupons and bills. Their reported (net) holdings of these most prized instruments so very clearly rise and fall with each deflation/reflation cycle. But there is no such thing according to the Fed narrative. There cannot be because four QE’s caused so much “money” to be “printed” something like that would be unthinkable – if it was ever the real thing it would reveal the whole corrupt nature of moneyless monetary policy.",GS,en,Zero Hedge

Not long after the last of the Goldman's former ruling triumvirate of Lloyd Blankfein, Gary Cohn and Harvey Schwartz left the bank, the unit from which all three men began their ascent to the top of the storied investment bank - namely, the commodities trading unit - is now on the chopping block, per WSJ . After suffering its worst year on record in 2017, commodities trading revenue improved slightly last year. But analysts say the unit is unlikely to match the profitability from the 2000s, when commodities trading contributed some 15% to the bank's pre-tax profits.

The 11 week stretch of outflows is the longest such streak since 2017 according to Bloomberg data. While in recent years loan funds saw persistent inflows on expectation of rising interest rates, this has now changed with the Fed's tightening phase now largely seen as over and the market expecting the next move from the Fed to be a rate cut.

Now that she's won what her cabinet believes is enough support for a modified version of the deal, having finally corralled a majority for something resembling her current deal, the hard work truly begins: Convincing the EU to reopen negotiations on the withdrawal agreement, something officials have publicly insisted will not happen (though there have been whispers that they have been slowly coming around to the idea).

The Treasury department said on Sunday that it had removed the sanctions imposed in April, backing a deal that has been hammered out by Deripaska and En+ over the past nine months. Even so, the decision to remove the sanctions prompted fresh controversy in Washington because of Deripaska’s continued ties to the companies and his links to Paul Manafort, Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman, even though Deripaska will remain under U.S. sanctions, and his property will remain blocked. ""This action ensures that the majority of directors on the En+ and Rusal boards will be independent directors, including US and European persons, who have no business, professional, or family ties to Deripaska or any other specially designated individuals, and that independent US persons vote a significant bloc of the shares of En +,” the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said in a statement.",GS,en,Zero Hedge

2019-01-05 16:08:45-05:00,How China Colonized An Entire Continent Without Firing A Single Shot,"Back in 1885, to much fanfare, the General Act of the Berlin Conference launched the Scramble for Africa which saw the partition of the continent, formerly a loose aggregation of various tribes, into the countries that currently make up the southern continent, by the dominant superpowers (all of them European) of the day. Subsequently Africa was pillaged, plundered, and in most places, left for dead. The fact that a credit system reliant on petrodollars never managed to take hold only precipitated the ""developed world"" disappointment with Africa, no matter what various enlightened, humanitarian singer/writer/poet/visionaries claimed otherwise. And so the continent languished…. until 2012 when what we then dubbed as the ""Beijing Conference "" quietly took place, and to which only Goldman Sachs, which too has been quietly but very aggressively expanding in Africa, was invited. As the map below, which we first showed in 2012, in just two years after 2010 China had pledged over $100 billion to develop commercial projects in Africa, a period in which the continent had effectively become de facto Chinese province, unchallenged by any developed nation which in the aftermath of the financial crisis had enough chaos at home to bother with what China may be doing in Africa.",GS,en,Zero Hedge

And while the full year amount was likely set to revert back to a modest surplus, it was only a matter of time before one of the most unique features of China's economy - its chronic current account surplus - was gone for good. The back in November, as part of its summary of Top Macro Trades for 2019, UBS wrote that the upcoming loss of China's current account cushion, softening domestic activity, and upcoming tariffs mean that ""for the first time in 25 years, China would have to make a choice between external stability and growth."" Now it is the Wall Street's Journal 's turn to bring attention to this topic, calling it a ""tectonic shift"" in China's economy, which has largely gone unnoticed by investors, and which is ""quietly beginning to upend the global financial system."" A key driver behind China's declining current account is that after having long been the world’s heavyweight saver and a huge buyer of foreign assets like Treasurys, the world's most populous nation is now a big spender, and in early 2018, China got more of its growth from consumption than the U.S., the global king of consumer spending where some 70% of economic growth is due to consumer spending.",GS,en,Zero Hedge

Commenting on this phenomenon, among others, yesterday JPMorgan quant Marko Kolanovic opined, correctly noting that "" liquidity has become to a large extent driven by market volatility"" reinforcing a negative feedback loop between volatility and liquidity, and as the most recent examples he cited the unprecedented drop in futures market depth or "" record low liquidity "" we discussed previously (shown in the chart below), the currency flash crash on Jan 2, or the equity market “upside crash” on December 26.

If nothing else, the report in the Wall Street Journal offers a benchmark against which the final deal can be judged. According to WSJ, the talks are focusing on boosting US exports and loosening regulations that discriminate against US firms operating in China (something the Chinese have been hinting at in recent policy decisions to lift import bans and remove retaliatory tariffs, while also reportedly weighing a decision to scrap their ""Made in China 2025"" policy).

Ominously, the slide in leveraged loan prices - which have collapsed in the past 6 weeks as a result of the events we described recently in "" Wheels Come Off The Leveraged Loan Market: Banks Unable To Offload Loans Amid Record Outflows "" - has trekked steadily downward in the past month even when stocks and high-yield bonds rebounded as they did on December 26 and 27. The liquidation has been so furious, that the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Price Index has not had a gain in any trading session since Nov. 1. And as prices fell, they created a feedback loop whereby lower prices led to accelerating outflows, and said outflows resulted in even more liquidation sales. Last week was no different, as investors continued to pull money out of U.S. leveraged loan funds at a historical pace, withdrawing $3.5 billion in the week ended Dec. 26 (split between $2.9BN in mutual funds and $626 million in ETFs), the third straight week of record setting withdrawals, following last week's then-record $3.3 billion and $2.5 billion the week prior.",GS,en,Zero Hedge

Mastercard says that spending was up 5.1% over last Christmas, which brings us to an astronomical $850 billion spent between November 1st and Christmas Eve. Of these shopping sprees, online sales increased by nearly 20% , which means that we could soon see another wave of brick and mortar closures , just like last year. Amazon pretty much owned Christmas, with a “record-breaking” holiday season , reporting one billion items delivered for free. Three times as many purchases this year were handled by Alexa , too, which means buyers didn’t even have to type in a credit card number. “Alexa, find me a bankruptcy attorney.” So, even though Americans blew through $850 billion dollars at Christmas, this may not actually mean that the economy is on the upswing.
