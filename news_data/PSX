The bank's chief US equity strategist and chief investment officer said in a Monday note that he expects the market to drop another 10% in the near term as investors face uncertainty around the election outcome, more fiscal stimulus, and another wave of COVID-19. But once the dust settles, Wilson said he expects the bull market to ensue — one which will be led by cyclical and smaller-cap stocks as earnings get a boost from the economic recovery. As such, Wilson recommended using a near term sell-off as a buying opportunity. ""We think the best opportunities lie in stocks where earnings are growing with the cyclical rebound and growing by enough to offset any valuation headwinds,"" Wilson said.

In an initial phase, the firm estimates the plant would help the Saltend Chemicals Park to reduce its emissions by nearly 900,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year and allow the park's industrial partners to switch to a hydrogen-natural gas blend.

2020-05-20 18:01:46-05:00,Renewable hydrogen has a key role to play in decarbonisation,"Marina Valls at RenewableUK reveals how green hydrogen could help catalyse the next phase of UK decarbonisation Reaching net zero emissions by 2050 means we have to get serious about decarbonising heat and transport. We've already made good progress in the power sector; government figures show 60 per cent of UK emission reductions comes from the decarbonisation our electricity supply. Heat and transport are lagging behind. We also need to make sure that the benefits of the investments we have made in cleaning up the power sector flow through even faster into the wider economy and into our daily lives. The demand for clean power is there, and by building a smarter and more flexible energy system, with consumers and businesses playing a more active role, everyone wins. A variety of new power sources and innovative technologies will help us to achieve this, and one of those in the vanguard is renewable hydrogen. National Grid's Future Energy Scenarios suggests that demand for green hydrogen in Britain could increase from 1TWh per year to 324TWh in 2050.",PSX,en,BusinessGreen

After a 8% drop in the last week of February, and enormous volatility to start the month of March, the S&P 500 is down 15% year-to-date. The sudden collapse in stocks comes as oil prices are also plummeting. The sudden fall in oil is hitting energy companies – oil drillers, refiners, and midstreamers – particularly hard, at a time when the sector had already been dealing with low prices. Yesterday was the worst day for oil prices since 1991. While the coronavirus is getting the attention, the immediate cause of the oil collapse was a sudden price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia. Both producers were reeling from the virus’s general impact on the markets, and consequent poor demand for oil; Saudi Arabia led OPEC in a move to cut back output and provide price support, but Russia refused to cooperate and tried to move in on Saudi market share. The Saudis responded by slashing prices – and then the bottom fell out.",PSX,en,Nasdaq
