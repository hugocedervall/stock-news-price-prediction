2020-12-03 10:16:59,ACC and Ambuja Cement to invest Rs 780 crore to set up waste heat recovery power plants,"Mumbai: Swiss building materials maker LafargeHolcim’s Indian operations, Ambuja Cement and ACC Ltd will be investing over Rs 780 crore to set up Waste Heat Recovery System (WHRS) based power plants, a step towards reducing carbon emissions, the company said on Thursday.“Six cement plants at both Ambuja Cement and ACC will invest over Rs 780 crores in green power generation, which will lead to a significant reduction of 5.61 lakh tons of carbon footprint annually. This is a major step in our journey towards reduction of carbon intensity,” said Neeraj Akhoury, managing director of Ambuja Cement.The WHRS will be installed at Ambuja Cement plants in Bhatapara (Chhattisgarh), Suli and Rauri (Himachal Pradesh) and Marwar Mundwa (Rajasthan), and at ACC plants in Jamul (Chhattisgarh) and Kymore (Madhya Pradesh).All projects are slated to be completed in the next 16 to 18 months.“This comes close on the heels of parent company LafargeHolcim signing the Net Zero Pledge with 2030 science-based targets during the Climate Week held in September 2020 in New York, USA,” the company said in a media statement.WHR power plants use waste heat from various sources like cement kilns, blast furnaces, sponge iron kilns, gas turbines, and convert these to power, thereby reducing consumption of fossil fuels.Both the companies set up their first WHRS in 2013-14 at Rabriyawas (Ambuja Cement) and Gagal (ACC).“In addition to boosting efficiency, WHRS is a proven method for reducing CO2 emissions, and part of helping reach LafargeHolcim’s ambition to reduce emissions due to electricity use by 65% by 2030,” the company said.By deciding to set these six WHRS, Ambuja and ACC have moved one step closer to realising the company’s sustainability goals – reducing usage of fossil fuel and thus reducing carbon footprint, Akhoury said.In addition, to further reduce carbon footprint Ambuja and ACC have also adopted the use of solar power in their cement manufacturing process.",ACC,en,Economic Times India

2019-09-12 01:26:18,Block winners can use coal at any plant now,"KOLKATA: Successful bidders of the current round of coal block auctions can use extracted coal at any of their plants including those at subsidiaries, provided the end-use plant is similar to the one specified during the auction. Earlier, operators were tied to the plant specified during the auction.The Centre, however, has rejected prospective bidders’ request of selling coal to Coal India at notified prices for the non-regulated sector, which is almost 20% higher than notified. They asked for a higher price as this round of auction was for the non-regulated sector — for which Coal India charges higher.Initially, the Centre had said that sale to Coal India will be at a discount of 15% on the notified price for sectors other than power utilities. Subsequently, they clarified that such a sale will be at a discount of 15% over the notified price for the power sector as well, offering Coal India over 20% margin for selling this coal in the open market. A block operator can sell up to 50% of their produce to Coal India in a year.Utilisation of coal at any other plant by the bidder would, however, be subject to the ministry’s scrutiny and prior approval from the Centre. “The block operator needs to inform the government at least 30 working days before it starts to divert coal to any other plants,” a senior executive from a prospective company said.Under the current round of auction, the government has offered to auction 27 blocks under three tranches — 8th, 9th and 10th — and successful bidders can sell 25% of the produce in the open market.71089560 Three dozen companies, including Reliance Cement, UltraTech Cement, Balco, Ambuja Cements, JSW Steel, Tata Steel, Hindalco Industries, Birla Corporation, ACC Cement and Vedanta are prospective bidders for the current round.Out of the 27 blocks on offer, 20 mines are estimated to hold an extractable reserve of 1 billion tonnes.",ACC,en,The Economic Times India
