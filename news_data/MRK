2020-12-09 11:18:05-05:00,Molnupiravir emerges as latest gamechanger drug for Covid-19,"New Delhi, Dec 9 (IANS) Even as the world cheers the progress being made on several vaccines to protect against the Covid-19 pandemic, there is great excitement now on Molnupiravir, a new anti-viral drug which according to latest research completely suppresses virus transmission within 24 hours. If these ferret-based data translate to humans, Covid-19 patients treated with the drug could become non-infectious within 24 hours after the beginning of treatment. The drug is in advance phase II/III clinical trials against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Molnupiravir is being developed by biotechnology firm Ridgeback Biotherapeutics in collaboration with Merck. Researchers in the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at the Georgia State University in the US have discovered that treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a new antiviral drug, Molnupiravir, completely suppresses virus transmission within 24 hours.

Here are the key milestones to watch out for. First, the FDA needs to grant Emergency Use Authorization Pfizer and Moderna don't get to decide when their shots go on the market. First, they both need to pass muster with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Dr. Peter Marks, who runs the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, where coronavirus vaccines are reviewed, recently told Business Insider that the process of reviewing Pfizer and Moderna's applications for Emergency Use Authorization, fast-tracking the shots into clinics, will still take ""weeks.""

Starting at the top, Berkshire trimmed its top, AAPL position, by 36.3MM shares from 980.6MM (pre split) to 944.3MM (post split), as the value of Berkshire's AAPL holdings as of Sept 30 rose to $109.4 billion, up from $89.4BN as of June 30. As Buffett trimmed his Apple position, he added to his 2nd biggest holding, Bank of America stock, which saw the increase of 85 million shares bringing his total holdings to 1.01 billion shares, of $24.3 billion.

Konzernweit kletterte der Umsatz zwischen Juli und September im Vergleich zum Vorjahr um 9,7 Prozent auf 4,4 Milliarden Euro, wie die Merck KGaA in Darmstadt mitteilte. Damit sei das dritte Quartal besser gelaufen als erwartet. Vorstandschef Stefan Oschmann sprach von einem «hervorragenden Geschäftsergebnis». Wegen eines Sonderertrags wuchs der bereinigte Betriebsgewinn (Ebitda) überproportional um 53 Prozent auf 1,7 Milliarden Euro. Merck hatte nach einem gewonnenen Patentstreit mit dem US-Konzern Biogen Rückstellungen von 365 Millionen Euro aufgelöst. Der Gewinn unterm Strich verdoppelte sich auf mehr als 800 Millionen Euro.

2020-11-05 14:30:15-05:00,Is It Time to Buy These 3 Dow Jones Stocks? Analysts Weigh In,"Voting in the U.S. presidential election is over and the world eagerly waits to see whether incumbent president Donald Trump will win four more years in the White House, or whether Joe Biden will put an end to one of the most controversial presidencies in the United States’ history. Although certain sectors would benefit from a President Donald Trump win, while other sectors would advance if Joe Biden wins, the pharmaceutical sector will be less affected either way. This is because everyone needs healthcare, especially these days with the COVID-19 pandemic still very much of a world-wide concern.With this in mind, we used TipRanks’ database to identify three large pharmaceutical stocks from the Dow Jones industrial average that have considerable upside potential and that have been endorsed by the analyst community.

S&P emini futures were last up 0.1%, extending a rally in Wednesday's stock market trading session. Nasdaq 100 emini futures rose 0.5%. Democratic candidate Joe Biden predicted a U.S. election win over President Donald Trump after pivotal victories in Michigan and Wisconsin, while the Republican incumbent sought to offset a narrowing path to re-election with lawsuits and demands for a recount. Both Trump and Biden still had paths to reach the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win as states kept counting mail-in ballots. However, Trump now has fewer options to secure a second four-year term. A surprise win by Republican Senator Susan Collins in Maine dimmed hopes by Democrats that they could get control of the U.S. Senate. ""Even if Joe Biden wins the Presidency, it looks like we are going to have a divided congress so the opportunity to have meaningful change at the fiscal level is pretty slim, and that is what is being priced into the back end of the market today,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston.

But it was here that, if you believe President Vladimir Putin, Russia won the global race to develop a vaccine against Covid-19.Praising the developers at the state-run Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology, Putin declared in August that Russia had registered a shot for public use, making it the first vaccine worldwide to gain such clearance. Russia named it Sputnik V after the Soviet-era satellite that set off the space race in 1957 — a clear signal of the geopolitical importance Putin has attached to the project.The president’s live-TV announcement glossed over one key point. Russia approved the vaccine after tests in fewer than 80 people, with larger trials needed to assess safety and effectiveness just underway.","MRK,MRNA",en,Economic Times India

They’re struggling to determine who is being infected and why, and to mitigate the economic impact of lockdowns and social distancing measures. If dealing with Covid-19 is stressing those states, however, the effort required to end the pandemic may exhaust them.Speaking to the Financial Times this week, the Indian vaccine manufacturer Adar Poonawalla — whose Serum Institute of India plans to produce a billion doses of an eventual vaccine, far in excess of any of its competitors — warned that vaccinating “everyone on this planet” poses an enormous governance challenge. He says there’s no “proper plan on paper” for distributing any successful vaccine; Serum may well provide 500 million doses to an Indian government that has no way to get them to people. And India’s infant immunization program has at least given the country some distribution capacity. The problem is worse elsewhere.",MRK,en,Economic Times India

Several COVID-19 vaccine candidates are in the late stages of testing, and the final results of the massive Phase 3 trials are expected by the end of the year. But a new polled showed increased resistance to COVID-19 vaccination compared to a few months ago. Vaccines could help the world reduce its novel coronavirus problem significantly, but that’s only assuming that at least one drug is safe and effective. It's also vital that a large percentage of the population is immunized to reduce the risk of future outbreaks.

Vaccine research for the novel coronavirus has advanced at a tremendous pace this year, with more than 170 experimental drugs already being tested to see whether they can prevent COVID-19.

In The Vaccine Race , Meredith Waldman describes how in the early 1960s scientists at Philadelphia’s Wistar Institute began working on a vaccine for rubella (German measles) using a controversial new method: germ-free cells from tissue extracted from an aborted foetus from a woman in Sweden. The Wistar cells were to revolutionise vaccine making, but ethical and political roadblocks meant it was 10 years before the institute was granted a patent, and it was not until 1978 that the Federal Drug Administration granted the pharmaceutical company Merck a licence for the vaccine in the US.

Because whether Trump likes it or not, China is the world's biggest market (by population) and second-biggest economy after the US (Chinese economists argue that it's already larger than the economy of the US) . And WeChat is critical medium through which Chinese consumers perform a multitude of tasks, from paying their bills, to ordering takeout, to shopping online - and so much more. According to a WSJ report, more than a dozen major US multinational companies raised concerns with the administration during a call with White House officials on Tuesday to discuss the scope and impact of Trump's executive order, which won't take effect until Sept. 15 .","MSFT,MS,MRK",en,Zero Hedge

For starters, a COVID-19 vaccine can be released if it's 'safe and proves effective' on as few as 50% of those who receive it , according to recently released federal guidelines.

Formerly known as EIDD-2801, the MK-4482 drug was at the center of the Rick Bright whistleblower complaint controversy in mid-May. Bright was removed as head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) in mid-April. Bright worried about the potential side effects of EIDD-2801, as some studies suggested it could cause harmful mutations. Merck said it would conduct “large pivotal studies” involving the drug in September, without disclosing any results from previous phases of human trials. As promising as vaccines may seem right now , they can't help patients who are already infected with the novel coronavirus.

2020-07-25 07:30:00-05:00,Don't hold your breath for a coronavirus vaccine. Here are the 7 biggest challenges we still need to overcome.,"Drugmakers, scientists, and governments are racing to develop a coronavirus vaccine at unprecedented speeds. It seems possible, or even likely, that a vaccine could be available by early 2021. But there are countless obstacles to creating a successful vaccine and ensuring people take it, including public skepticism about a vaccine's safety and the fair and equitable distribution of shots. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . If a fire breaks out in a school or a movie theater, everyone knows what to do: head for the exits. The exit plan for this pandemic, on the other hand, is uncharted territory. What's certain is that a vaccine is crucial. That's why scientists and governments are working at unprecedented speeds to create one. Since the start of the outbreak, top health officials have said it'll take about 12-18 months for a vaccine to be ready. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said he's ""optimistic"" that we'll have at least one vaccine ready by the end of this year or the start of 2021.","MRK,MRNA",en,Business Insider
2020-07-25 03:36:47-05:00,The supply chain to save the world is unprepared for a coronavirus vaccine,"By Brendan Murray and Riley GriffinThe industries that shepherd goods around the world on ships, planes and trucks acknowledge they aren’t ready to handle the epic challenges of shipping an eventual Covid-19 vaccine from drugmakers to billions of people.Already stretched thin by the pandemic, freight companies face problems ranging from shrinking capacity on container ships and cargo aircraft to a lack of visibility on when a vaccine will arrive. Shippers have struggled for years to reduce cumbersome paperwork and upgrade old technology that, unless addressed soon, will slow the relay race to transport fragile vials of medicine in unprecedented quantities.Making a vaccine quickly is hard enough but distributing one worldwide offers a host of other variables, and conflicting forces may work against the effort: The infrastructure powering the global economy is scaling down for a protracted downturn just as pharmaceutical companies need to scale up for the biggest and most consequential product launch in modern history.“We’re not prepared,” Neel Jones Shah, global head of air carrier relationships at San Francisco-based freight forwarder Flexport, said during a webinar this week with other logistics executives.77165766“Let’s all be honest here, vaccine supply chains are exponentially more complex than PPE supply chain,” he said, referring to personal protective equipment like surgical masks and gloves. “You can’t ruin PPE by leaving it on the tarmac for a couple of days.","MRK,MRNA",en,Economic Times India

New tools including vaccines have helped contain the outbreak, second only to the 2013-16 West African outbreak that killed more than 11,300, despite public mistrust and conflict affecting the response in parts of the region. The new vaccine, which has passed clinical trials but has never been tested in a real-world setting, will be administered to 50,000 people in Goma, a city of two million on the Rwandan border, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said in a statement. The vaccine, which requires two injections eight weeks apart, will be rolled out alongside another manufactured by Merck, which only requires a single shot. The Merck vaccine has been administered to over 250,000 people since the start of the outbreak in August 2018. “The introduction of a second vaccine is not meant to replace [Merck’s] vaccine, but to complement it and hopefully provide us with an additional tool in the fight against future Ebola outbreaks,” said John Johnson, who is leading the project for MSF.",MRK,en,AfricaNews

But over the past year, the cyberweapon has boomeranged back and is now showing up in the NSA’s own backyard.It is not just in Baltimore. Security experts say EternalBlue attacks have reached a high, and cybercriminals are zeroing in on vulnerable American towns and cities, from Pennsylvania to Texas, paralyzing local governments and driving up costs.The NSA connection to the attacks on U.S. cities has not been previously reported, in part because the agency has refused to discuss or even acknowledge the loss of its cyberweapon, dumped online in April 2017 by a still-unidentified group calling itself the Shadow Brokers.","MRK,MSFT",en,The Economic Times India

The medicine, MK-8591, is being developed by US drug giant Merck . That could give Merck an edge in a market expected to top $21 billion by 2026, though it's still early days. Merck has been tight-lipped about the project so far. Business Insider spoke with two top scientists about the drug and implant tech, and with HIV experts and others about how the effort could fare. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. The story of one of the most promising HIV treatments being developed today begins in Japan more than a decade ago. When taking a look at modern HIV medicines, Japanese scientist Hiroshi Ohrui saw certain shortcomings. But he also noticed a way to change and improve them. Medical care for people with HIV has come a long way from the days when there were no treatments at all, and a diagnosis often meant death. Today, at least in the US and other wealthy nations , those with the virus can take daily pills to suppress it, and there are also pills that can help prevent people from getting HIV in the first place.","MRK,MS",en,Business Insider

Zurich saw things differently. The insurer classified the attacks, which also hit servers of several other big companies, including Merck & Co. and A.P. Moller-Maersk AS, as an act of war. Since the Mondelez policy has a clause that excludes acts of war, the insurer denied the claim. Mondelez is suing Zurich for $100 million, claiming the coverage is warranted and calling the insurer’s response “unreasonable,” according to court documents. Many companies have long-standing property insurance policies that offer a payout if a cyberattack results in physical damage, but they may not cover financial damage.
