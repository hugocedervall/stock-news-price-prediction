""Asset manager M&A wave will continue with a variety of potential transactions,"" analysts at Credit Suisse led by Craig Siegenthaler wrote to clients on Thursday. The evening before, Australia-based Macquarie Group said it would acquire investment manager Waddell & Reed. Macquarie is set to buy the Overland Park, Kansas-based firm for $1.7 billion, or $2.3 billion Australian dollars, and is set to sell Waddell's wealth management business to major independent US broker-dealer LPL Financial for some $300 million once that deal closes. The plans to acquire Waddell, the parent company of Ivy Investments, which Business Insider previously reported could be sold off , sent analysts wondering which firm could be next. Credit Suisse pegged BrightSphere Investment Group, WisdomTree Investments, Janus Henderson, and Cohen & Steers as the ""likeliest sellers,"" and named Invesco and Franklin Resources as possible acquirers of other firms.",GEN,en,Business Insider
