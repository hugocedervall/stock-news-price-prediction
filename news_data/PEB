After an acquisition spree, Taj sold its Boston property for $125 million in FY17.The deal will also mark the first cross-border acquisition by IHCL under Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran and company CEO Puneet Chhatwal, coming at a time when the global travel and hospitality sector has been decimated by the Covid-19 pandemic.Mubadala, Viceroy Hotels, Tata Sons and IHCL didn’t respond to queries.Positioned as a boutique lifestyle luxury brand, California based Viceroy provides hotel management and development services in several of the big US cities like San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles, that cater to business travellers, the high-end leisure markets in Latin America and the Caribbean and a few across Europe.IHCL has a portfolio of 200 hotels including 42 under development properties globally across 12 countries.",PEB,en,Economic Times India
