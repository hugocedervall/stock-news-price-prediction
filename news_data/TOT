Saudi Arabia is offering its flagship Arab Light crude into Rotterdam for roughly $25 a barrel, a massive discount to the price of Russia’s Urals.European refiners including Royal Dutch Shell Plc, BP Plc, Total SA, OMV AG, Repsol SA and Cepsa SA have all received crude allocations from state-owned Saudi Aramco significantly above their normal levels, according to people familiar with their operations. The range of extra supplies was between 25% and 200%, depending of the company, the same people said. 74588367 The Saudi discounts are so big that Arab Light will “push out” Urals and other crude streams “from regional refiners’ diet” unless their relative price also falls, Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at consultant Energy Aspects Ltd.",TOT,en,The Economic Times India
