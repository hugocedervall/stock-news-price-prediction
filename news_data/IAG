Short sellers generated GBP828 million (USD1.067 billion) from FTSE 100 bets last month, and made profits on 75 out of the 100 companies that comprise the UK’s blue-chip index, according to new data from London-based equities analytics and research provider Ortex Analytics. In September, hedge funds made GBP543 million betting against the London benchmark. In what proved to be a “bumper” month for bearish managers, bets against Rolls Royce were the most profitable short for the second consecutive month - netting hedge funds GBP238 million in October, after September’s GBP244 million win.

2020-10-08 02:00:00-05:00,Betting against the FTSE 100 netted traders £418 million in September. These are the top 5 most and least profitable short sells last month,"Summary List Placement Short sellers made a profit of £418 million across the entire FTSE 100 index in September, according to recent analysis from Ortex Analytics , a global financial analytics company. The FTSE 100 was one of the worst-performing major indices in Europe in September, as a surge in cases of COVID-19 and tighter restrictions on movement, coupled with renewed concern over Brexit, hit UK assets harder than most regional markets. The index fell 2%, compared with a 1.6% fall in the euro zone Stoxx 50. The FTSE tracks the 100 largest companies on the London Stock Exchange with the highest market capitalization. Overall, short sellers made a profit on 53 out of the 100 companies in the index. Some of the FTSE's heavyweight stocks are those that have been worst-hit by the economic fallout of the pandemic, including jet engine manufacturer Rolls Royce, airlines, such as British Airways parent company IAG, or financial stock, such as HSBC or Barclays.

Overall, short sellers made gains from more than half of all FTSE 100-listed companies (53 out of 100), according to new data from Ortex Analytics, with Rolls Royce proving to be the most profitable wager, bringing in GBP187.7 million for bearish managers. September’s bounce-back marks a reversal of fortunes for hedge funds betting against FTSE 100 companies, an index often seen as a bellwether for investor confidence. In August, managers suffered a GBP420 million hit after UK equity market gains sent many sizable short bets southwards. Peter Hillerberg, co-founder of London-based equity research firm Ortex, noted that four of the five most profitable shorts in September had earlier been significant loss-makers in August, underlining how renewed uncertainty over the Covid-19 pandemic has underpinned the rebound. “Last month we saw a number of big trades turn sour for short-sellers which impacted overall profitability in August,” Hillerberg observed. “At the time, we predicted that the pendulum may swing back the other way in September and that’s exactly what we’ve seen as short sellers continue to profit from the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic.” Among the big bets to pay off were International Consolidated Airlines Group, owner of British Airways, Aer Lingus and Iberian.",IAG,en,Hedgeweek

2020-09-03 05:23:41-05:00,Hedge fund short sellers suffer USD500m hit in August from wayward FTSE 100 wagers,"Hedge fund short sellers suffer USD500m hit in August from wayward FTSE 100 wagers Submitted By Hugh Leask | 03/09/2020 - 11:23am Hedge funds have lost almost USD560 million after several hefty short bets on a range of FTSE 100 stocks turned sour as equity markets yielded solid gains. New data from London-based equity research firm Ortex Analytics shows almost three-quarters of total short losses in August came from big wagers against just five names: Ocado Group, InterContinental Hotels, International Consolidated Airlines Group, BHP and Pearson. Together, they accounted for a bruising GBP310 million loss out of a total hit of GBP420 million to hedge fund short sellers last month. As UK equities gained ground towards the end of the summer, hedge funds made gains from short positions in just a third of FTSE 100 names - 32 companies out of the total 100 in the index – as negative wagers in all sectors ultimately went awry. Hargreaves Lansdown proved the most profitable target for short sellers, delivering GBP26 million in August, followed by the National Grid (GBP17.6 million), HSBC (GBP16.2 million), and Royal Dutch Shell (GBP15.1 million).",IAG,en,Hedgeweek

The sobering reality for airlines, which are operating at skeleton levels to survive the near-total halt in travel due to the coronavirus pandemic, is that data on passenger demand in subsequent months will be many times worse. The elimination of so much passenger traffic is also a negative for cargo shippers, who rely on belly space on passenger aircraft to move goods and are having trouble finding alternative transport – even at huge premiums . International Airlines Group, the multi-national holding company that includes British Airways, Iberia and Aerlingus, said it will cut the number of passenger seats in service by 90% in April in May, up from plans two weeks ago to downsize operations by 75%.

Jet, which previously had a fleet of around 120 largely Boeing Co planes, was forced to indefinitely halt all flight operations on April 17 after its banks rejected the carrier's plea for emergency funds. The carrier's descent into crisis has benefited international airlines in the form of rising fares and demand, data showed. Fares from India to cities such as Dubai, London, New York, Singapore and Bali in the first quarter of 2019 rose between 4 percent and 32 percent from a year ago, according to Indian travel portal MakeMyTrip Ltd. In the peak travel months of May and June, fares to London have spiked as much as 36 percent and tickets to San Francisco are up nearly 20 percent from a year ago, according to data from travel portal Yatra.com. ""For the next three months it's actually bonanza time for international players,"" said Ashish Nainan, a research analyst at CARE Ratings. ""At least until the middle of June, the fares are not going to come down."" Due to rising demand, even before Jet's lessors grounded planes, carriers such as British Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd, Singapore Airlines Ltd and United Airlines saw an up to a 27 percent increase in passenger numbers from India in the last quarter of 2018, data from India's aviation regulator showed.",IAG,en,The Economic Times India
