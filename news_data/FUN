2019-05-15 11:18:44-05:00,THEN AND NOW: What 8 abandoned amusement parks looked like before they became ruins,"Some abandoned amusement parks still contain spooky remnants of attractions. The Upstream Plunge pool at an abandoned Disney water park has been drained and filled with cement. Six Flags New Orleans never reopened after Hurricane Katrina. Visit INSIDER's homepage for more stories. During the peak summer months, amusement parks are usually packed with people riding roller coasters, playing games, and posing for photos. But these parks are permanently in the off-season . Here's what eight abandoned amusement parks looked like before they became ruins. Six Flags acquired an existing theme park called Jazzland in 2003 and turned it into Six Flags New Orleans. The park took inspiration from its location and included areas based on the famous architecture of the French Quarter. The park never recovered after Hurricane Katrina. After the storm, the park was left standing in four to seven feet of water, and had extensive wind and flood damage. A photojournalist known as Seph Lawless visited the park and documented it and other abandoned amusement parks around the world in his book ""Abandoned: Hauntingly Beautiful Deserted Theme Parks .""
