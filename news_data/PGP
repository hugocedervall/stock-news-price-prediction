Now, instead of being acquired, Harry's is open to making acquisitions. Co-CEO Jeff Raider told Business Insider that the company would consider buying small brands that it could scale up using resources it has in-house, similar to a startup accelerator. Going into new categories has taken on added importance for Harry's this year. In February, Edgewell, the maker of Schick razors, scrapped plans to buy the company for $1.37 billion after the Federal Trade Commission sued to block the deal on the grounds that it would reduce competition. Harry's and other startups like Dollar Shave Club broke into the market by offering razors at lower prices than established players like Edgewell and Procter & Gamble. ""Right now, we're focused on our own independent strategy,"" Raider said. ""Though we would consider buying brands in addition to building them.""

And over the past 10 years, it has reduced its energy consumption by 392,851 gigajoules and its greenhouse gas emissions by 26 per cent. The company also has reached zero-manufacturing-waste-to-landfill status across all plants in its global network. On Monday, Gillette announced its 2030 goals to uplevel its sustainability ambitions.

""We've done a lot over the 10 years. But we're not complacent,"" said Gary Coombe, CEO at Gillette. ""And we recognise there's still a lot to do."" One of Gillette's 2030 goals is to maintain zero-waste-to-landfill status.

But sales results at the consumer goods behemoth's shaving business, which includes Gillette and Venus, have declined for much of the calendar year — continuing a streak of quarterly losses that began before March. Now, Gary Coombe, CEO of P&G's global grooming businesses, says that turning to products that cater to men with facial hair, like beard oil, electric shavers, and new razors made from recycled materials is the key to fixing the problem. ""We're in the midst of a significant transformation of the Gillette business, a business that hasn't performed as we would have wished over the last decade,"" he said in an interview with Business Insider. Early readings suggest he could be right.

After his father suffered a heart attack in 2017, Cohen made a series of tough calls to spend more time with him: scrapping plans to take Chewy public, selling the company for $3.4 billion, and resigning as CEO the following year. Cohen broke with convention again by investing the vast majority of his wealth in two stocks , Apple and Wells Fargo, and later placing a contrarian bet on ailing video-game retailer GameStop. The entrepreneur attributes his independent streak to the ""two biggest influences on my professional life"": his father, Ted Cohen, who passed away last December, and Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO. ""Something critical that I learned from my dad and Warren Buffett was the ability to separate myself from the herd and think independently,"" Cohen told Business Insider this week. The pair's teachings allow him to ""block out the noise, develop my own point of view, and not be influenced by daily headlines or the consensus or what's in style."" For example, many people initially doubted Chewy would be able to ship 30-pound bags of pet food to customers and make any money. ""In the early years, few investors thought Chewy was a good idea,"" Cohen said. ""I struck out raising capital over 100 times."" Ignoring the skeptics, as well as avoiding distractions and saying ""no"" to all but the best opportunities, enabled Cohen to focus on the things most critical to Chewy's success: competitive prices, compelling products, fast shipping, and personalized customer service.","PGP,PG",en,Business Insider

Over the past 18 months, Spotify has pushed beyond music into audio formats like podcasts and audiobooks, with a focus on exclusive and original content from sought-after creators, entertainment brands, and podcast networks, as it vies to become the largest audio network in the world . It marks a new era for the streaming company, which rose to prominence with a music library that was much the same as what could found elsewhere, setting itself apart with algorithms, curation, and user experience instead of content. But through podcasting, Spotify is now the exclusive podcast home of talent including Barack and Michelle Obama, Joe Rogan, and Kim Kardashian. It's partnering with brands like DC Comics to create fictional audio universes around its comics, as exist in TV and film. And it's acquired major podcast publishers and networks, like Anchor, Gimlet, Parcast, and The Ringer, and the rosters of talent and IP that come with them.","PGP,PG",en,Business Insider

Currently, I do not know if this is healthy or if eventually it turns out to be unhealthy but a correction is always acceptable because you need a little breathing space. Having said that, the economy does not look great. On stockmarkets, we have had one set of numbers and the next set of numbers will start coming in October. So fundamentals would not be as great even in this quarter except for some sectors. This rally is fuelled a lot by liquidity. Some of that liquidity has reduced because of some of the new Sebi norms and such. It will take some time for that system to re-energise or to find its feet again.

2020-06-29 10:01:00-05:00,Facebook's ad revenue could take a hit if more brands follow Unilever's lead on boycott,"This story was delivered to Insider Intelligence eMarketer Briefing subscribers earlier this morning. Insider Intelligence analyzes this industry and several others to provide in-depth analyst reports, proprietary forecasts, customizable charts, and more. Learn more about what we offer. Facebook's advertiser boycott is gaining steam: Last Friday, Unilever became the largest company to commit to pulling ad spend on the platform — and not just for July, as the boycott calls for, but for the rest of 2020. In response, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reversed his original stance Friday afternoon, saying the company would ""start labeling posts it deems newsworthy but that also violates its policies,"" though this doesn't necessarily address all of the boycott's recommendations . More advertisers joining the boycott could cause a domino effect. Last week, we predicted that even with a growing number of advertisers boycotting, it was unlikely to affect Facebook's ad revenues. But this major pullback from Unilever — and a growing number of brands that have joined since we last covered it, including Verizon and Honda — could change that. ""Unilever making a move like this changes the calculus for other big brand advertisers, especially Procter & Gamble ,"" said Nicole Perrin, eMarketer principal analyst at Insider Intelligence.","PGP,PG",en,Business Insider

Sustainable packaging is a keystone issue for corporate sustainability. As one of the first environmental concerns companies began to tackle proactively, interest and efforts had notable resurgence in the last few years, partly spurred by the attention on ocean plastic. Then the pandemic hit, and the market changed — characterized by higher demand for single-use packages and bags, and lower availability of recycled materials. When we look ahead, are we on the path to a circular and sustainable system for packaging? From paper vs. plastic to reusable vs. single use Shopping bags have long been a focus in sustainability — from looking at greenhouse gas impacts (paper is higher) to litter (plastic has more challenges) and significant policy action. A shift away from a focus on single-use design emerged. Studies pointed out that bags that are effectively reused can be the best environmental option.","PGP,PG",en,GreenBiz

""We are making more Charmin and Bounty and Pampers and Luvs than we've ever made before in the history of this plant,"" Del Los Rios said.

In mid-May, the Eco-Boxes are becoming available for other fabric care product lines, including Tide purclean, Downy, Gain, and Dreft. The initiatives are related to P&G's current sustainability goals introduced in 2018, Ambition 2030, which include a commitment to make its packaging 100 per cent recyclable or reusable by 2030. Each business unit within P&G has its own approach, and the Eco-Box was one way P&G's Fabric Care division set out to meet its packaging goal. To be clear, the Eco-Box package still includes plastic - with the bag that holds the liquid detergent itself - but uses 60 per cent less of it than the traditional packaging for P&G's detergent brands. ""We've moved to a huge reduction in plastic, but [the plastic bag] not curbside-recyclable,"" said Todd Cline, section head for P&G Fabric Care's research and development team. ""I think perfection is [figuring] out the technologies to make this so that that bag and tap are also just easy curbside recycling,"" he continued. ""But there's just not technologies for that yet today, to create bags to hold liquids that are puncture-resistant and will survive all of the shipping.""

However, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has also been a bit of a Scrooge this year, as he continues to pass up acquisitions and instead hoard his money. The billionaire has long been seeking a really big deal on which to spend some of his company’s $128 billion of cash, except everything is overpriced in his view. To make matters more frustrating, Berkshire’s own shares are lagging behind the broader U.S. market by the most since 2009.While 2019 wasn’t Buffett’s worst year, it was surely one of his dullest. With Berkshire’s cash pile reaching new heights, Buffett has said that just the thought of taking over another company — he’s acquired nearly 200 during his career — causes his heart “to beat faster.” Instead, this chart of Berkshire’s stock performance looks like it’s almost flat-lining:72943352 Berkshire shares are on track to end the year up a modest 11%, trailing the S&P 500 index by 20 percentage points.","PGP,PG",en,The Economic Times India

Dropping their membership in PLASTICS is one way these big brand owners can get the activist groups off their backs, at least for a while. There’s no guarantee that the anti-plastic activists will not pursue packaged consumer goods companies to the ends of the earth to get them to stop using plastic in any form. These companies caved to pressure from activist organizations that do not understand polymer science. By leaving the association, these consumer goods companies are also acknowledging that science means nothing in their business, even as most of these companies use science to develop their products.","PGP,PG",en,PlasticsToday

Many such companies are being questioned by the anti-profiteering authorities.The tax rate on most FMCG products was about 15% when GST of 28% was introduced on them, an increase that was not fully passed on to customers. Subsequently, GST on products including shampoos, cosmetics and groceries was slashed to 18% in November that same year.The NAA is taking prices for the July-October period of 2017 as the base to see whether the benefits of a lower rate have been passed on to customers. Experts said the authority is considering only one aspect of costing, which is causing problems.“The authorities should take into consideration all factors impacting prices, including industry-specific nuances, instead of just carrying out a mechanical comparison of prices pre- and post-rate change,” said Rohit Jain, a partner at Economic Laws Practice, a law firm. “Many companies that had absorbed the tax burden on implementation of GST between July and October are now more at a loss as they are being asked to further reduce 10% without considering what was absorbed.”Many firms say the NAA must take a product’s earnings as the benchmark to determine profiteering.While HUL, Nestle and P&G are being questioned on why they did not pass on GST benefits on their products, other companies are also being investigated, industry experts said.",PGP,en,The Economic Times India

Companies say premium items that are costly to manufacture compared with basic versions are still being sold at lower margins unlike pharmaceutical companies that use similar technology and raw materials but have different pricing. Therefore, the analogy doesn’t hold for hygiene products, they argue.“For advertising spends, new launches and even innovation, we need profitability,” said a senior executive at a multinational consumer goods company. “The margin for us and trade is not very high since they are nascent categories and we are focussing on increasing usage by squeezing margins already.

The latter recently cut HUL’s shelf space by nearly a third in the segment to make space for Future’s own line of detergent liquid and powder products.The new liquid detergent product from parent Unilever’s portfolio, Love Home and Planet, will be HUL’s fifth fabric wash brand, and is expected to be launched next month, said two officials aware of the development. The move is reminiscent of HUL’s introduction of Wheel detergent in 1988 to take on Nirma, which had dislodged Surf as washing powder of choice in middleclass and lower-middleclass Indian homes. HUL’s other detergent brands are Rin, Surf Excel and Sunlight and the company accounts for a third of India’s Rs 24,000 crore laundry market.Common FeaturesHUL is also hoping to score on the green front with an environmentally friendly product.While HUL declined to comment, Future Group said its liquid detergent brand Voom’s positioning is “caring for fabric and fashion”, something that’s new in a segment that thrives on stain removal. “We feel existing laundry makers will follow this narrative but our pricing and fashion push will be far more competitive,” said Ashni Biyani, managing director of Future Consumer Ltd, the group’s consumer goods arm that introduced the product last week.The two brands from HUL and Future Group have some common features.",PGP,en,The Economic Times India

2019-04-19 12:29:02-05:00,Why India may need a Modi encore in 2019,"By Jagdish N Sheth & Gyanendra SinghIndia is far better off economically than it was five years ago. Fiscal management has been outstanding, and it has been clocking the highest growth rate among large economies.Major reforms, such as goods and services tax (GST), Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), and Real Estate Regulatory Authority (Rera) have been enacted. Infrastructure, financial inclusion and social reform campaigns have moved at a brisk pace. Doing business is easier, there is less corruption, more innovation. As a result, the individual citizen is better off than she was five years ago.Despite this progress, however, India fares poorly when compared to its peers among the Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) countries, never mind the developed OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) group. It also languishes in the UN Human Development Index (HDI).Therefore, India’s journey to progress and prosperity is far from complete. At current growth rates of about 7%, it will take two more decades for India to reach ‘high income’ or ‘high human development’ country status.Faster growth can come only with ‘deep reforms’, such as land acquisition and labour regulations.Many commentators believe that India can transform itself without transformational leadership — that no matter what government comes, India will continue its march towards its manifest destiny.","PGP,PG",en,The Economic Times India

2019-01-23 16:01:28-05:00,"Stocks, Dollar Slide As Global Growth Gloom Grows","No one wins today… Chinese stocks trod water overnight...
