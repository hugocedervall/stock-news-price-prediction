It had earlier predicted an expansion of 9-10% before the Covid-led lockdown had begun, which was later scaled down to an expansion of 5-6%, and subsequently to flat growth in July.However, companies disagree.“The (Nielsen) forecast is contrary to our expectations; we are seeing a healthy revival,” said Mayank Shah, senior category head at the country’s biggest cookies maker Parle Products, which sells Parle-G, Milano and Hide & Seek brands of cookies. “While there has been some downtrading in spending in urban India, overall the biscuits category is growing in both urban and rural markets and we expect the momentum to continue.”Sales over the web platforms and in rural areas point to a recovery underway.“We have seen a steady recovery in demand sequentially with some channels and geographies, like e-commerce and rural, growing at a fast pace.",NLSN,en,Economic Times India

The system will be a way to measure audiences across all media Nielsen tracks, including linear TV , addressable TV, and digital media . Such measurement options are becoming more important as third-party cookies are phased out and increasingly subject to privacy legislation. Nielsen's system will create an identity graph that maps user profiles onto various identifiers associated with them—for example, their email address or phone number—rather than creating those user profiles using cookies or other trackers. These IDs will then be used to track that user's viewing across platforms to measure a show's ratings or an ad's viewership, for example. ID graphs are a necessity for cross-channel measurement, and Nielsen relies on its proprietary panel-based data. ID graphs will power, among other things, the deduplication of audiences across media measured by Nielsen.",NLSN,en,Business Insider

The pandemic has accelerated cord cutting as the number of streaming services grows while advertisers cut linear TV budgets and rework big commitments with networks like NBCUniversal, Disney, and ViacomCBS. And AT&T — one of the biggest sellers of targeted, or so-called addressable advertising — is reportedly mulling spinning off its pay-TV service DirecTV and digital ad firm Xandr that was supposed to help it along. Addressable advertising has always represented a small amount of TV inventory, but the coronavirus has exposed some of its pitfalls like high ad prices, a lack of measurement standards, and growing competition from streaming TV companies. When the coronavirus shut down production schedules and sports, advertisers pulled their addressable campaigns along with national ad spend, said Matt Kramer, managing director of advanced advertising at Omnicom Media Group.",NLSN,en,Business Insider

2020-08-21 06:53:57-05:00,Why online retailers should increase transparency about their products,"What would change if e-commerce retailers shared information about a product's climate footprint? When shopping online, consumers are able to see a lot of information about a product. There's the product description and specifications of an item. For a bottle of perfume, the listing would declare the fluid ounces and describe the scent. A piece of clothing would show the material makeup and available sizes. A page for a bookshelf would have information about the dimensions. And of course, all of these would display the cost. But even with so much information at the ready, it is still rare to see details about the impact the product has on the climate or the chemical makeup of an item. The Environmental Defense Fund is calling for change. ""You have this greater real estate available to share this information about products right on the product page, just like you would the size of a product or colors or product reviews and you have the ability to tell more of the sustainability story, because you essentially have endless shelf space online,"" said Boma Brown-West, senior manager of EDF+Business at the Environmental Defense Fund, the arm of EDF focused on corporate sustainability.",NLSN,en,BusinessGreen

This mirrors the strategy of streaming services like Netflix, which typically bypass the pilot process. Two big reasons for the change are that more TV shows are being rebooted than ever before and costs are rising. But pilot orders have also stabilized in the last year across the five networks: 74 were ordered in 2018, and 73 were ordered this year, according to Ampere. "" There's no one model that the networks have adopted as they move away from pilots, rather they have opted a range of development options, including reboots and spin-offs, co-production, remakes, and straight-to-series,"" Fred Black, Ampere Analysis analyst, said in the report.

2019-03-29 05:30:18-05:00,Cal Newport Teaches You How to Reboot Your Work Life,"(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- According to Nielsen, the average American spends three hours a day staring into a phone or tablet. Factor in TVs and computers, and it’s up to about nine hours in the glow of a screen. That’s a lot of time that could be better used for professional gain. In his latest book, Digital Minimalism, technology and productivity expert Cal Newport offers advice on how to free yourself from the tyranny of email, social media, and other digital services. Here are six actions you can take now. ① Schedule Uninterrupted Work Blocks Chart your workday in two-hour periods and quarantine tasks that don’t necessarily boost productivity—including meetings and phone calls—to some scheduled breaks between the blocks. “If you take a two-hour block and do literally no quick checks, your mind is operating at full capacity,” Newport says. It’s like having a cognitive superpower. ② Hang Out With Yourself By pulling out our phones at the first hint of boredom, most of us suffer from what Newport calls “solitude deficit,” which could be partly responsible for a 5 percent jump in anxiety-related disorders from 2017 to 2018.",NLSN,en,Bloomberg
