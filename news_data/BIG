Its global head of ad sales describes how the company is building new ad products to salvage its business.,"Google-owned navigation app Waze took a roughly 60% hit in ad revenue due to the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, its global head of sales Suzie Reider said. Waze has responded by building new tools for advertisers and app users, she said.

Click here for more BI Prime stories . In recent years, Waze has made a play for bigger share of brands' out-of-home budgets. But the Google-owned navigation app's ad revenue hit a speedbump with the coronavirus pandemic and people being under lockdown. ""The single value proposition of our business is to turn locations into destinations — we are all about mobility,"" said Suzie Reider, Waze's global head of sales.
