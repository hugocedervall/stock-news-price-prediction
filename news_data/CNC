They reveal a surprising trend.,"Summary List Placement Healthcare executives have a clear favorite for the White House, and it's not the person who gave them a big tax cut three years ago. America's top healthcare bosses are pouring cash into Democratic candidate Joe Biden's campaign and the outside groups supporting him, an Insider analysis of Federal Election Commission records and data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics shows. Insider reviewed the campaign-spending records for executives at 100 major healthcare companies this election cycle, including drugmakers, insurers, health-tech companies, and hospitals. The Biden campaign has raised almost $47 million in personal donations from healthcare executives over the course of the 2020 cycle, while President Donald Trump's campaign has brought in $21 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which runs the money-in-politics website Open Secrets. That does not include donations coming in through super PACs, the political-action committees allowed to raise unlimited amounts of money from people and companies.",CNC,en,Business Insider

On Sept. 1, an estimated 19,000 children in state care were shifted to a managed care health system within the state’s Medicaid program. And while Marc Smith, acting director of the Department of Children and Family Services, declares the transition a “great success,” outside observers say a large number of children still are not getting the care they need. “I want to be clear. There are children in Illinois who are not receiving critical health services that they need when they need to have it,” ACLU attorney Heidi Dalenberg told a legislative committee Thursday. The state is responsible for providing health care to children in foster care as well as those who have been adopted out of foster care or who have aged out of the system but are still younger than 21.",CNC,en,Sauk Valley Media
