2019-04-04 04:58:00-05:00,This stock picker is crushing 95% of his peers investing mostly in companies you haven’t heard of. Here are his secrets for uncovering those hidden gems.,"Gerry Frigon, the lead manager of the Taylor Frigon Core Growth Fund, shares his unique approach to filling out a stock portfolio — one that leads to him buying lots of non-traditional names. Frigon's fund has soared 22% over the past year, putting it in the 95th percentile relative to competitors. It's not lost on Gerry Frigon that there are roughly half as many public companies now compared to 15 years ago. For a money manager like him, that's made it doubly difficult to find market-beating investment opportunities. But if recent results are any indication, that hasn't stopped him from reaping impressive returns. Frigon is the lead manager of the Taylor Frigon Core Growth Fund , which recently cracked Kiplinger's top 10 ranking for mutual funds . According to Bloomberg data, the fund has soared 22% and beaten 95% of its peers over past year, nearly doubling the benchmark S&P 500 over that period. Frigon — who is also president and chief investment officer at Taylor Frigon Capital Management, where he oversees $200 million — attributes this to a strategy that involves looking for largely undiscovered early-stage companies. ""We talk about taking a venture capital approach to buying public companies,"" Frigon recently told Business Insider by phone. ""We're sort of the antithesis of modern portfolio theory."" A quick peek at the Core Growth fund's biggest holdings show this strategy in action: Glaukos , Kornit Digital , Mellanox Technologies , Airgain , and Carvana make up the top five.",CVNA,en,Business Insider
