2020-02-12 22:02:31-05:00,"Australia court backs $10 bln Vodafone-TPG merger, overruling regulator","SYDNEY : An Australian court on Thursday approved a A$15 billion ($10.1 billion) merger between a local arm of Britain’s Vodafone Group and internet provider TPG Telecom, overruling an earlier move by the antitrust regulator to block the deal. The Federal Court ruled that the tie-up between Vodafone’s local joint venture partner, Hutchison Telecommunications (Australia) Ltd, and TPG would not harm competition. That trumped last year’s negative decision by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and revives a plan to challenge the dominance of Telstra Corp Ltd and Singapore Telecommunications’s Optus in the Australian market. “The proposed merger would not have the effect, nor be likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition in the supply of retail mobile services in Australia,“ Federal Court judge John Middleton said on Thursday. “Accordingly … the merger can proceed as contemplated,“ he added. Hutchison shares surged 25%, while TPG shares gained 15%.",HTA,en,The Sun Daily
