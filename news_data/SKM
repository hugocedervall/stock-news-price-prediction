By 2020, more than one-fifth of the world's countries will have launched 5G services. Securing global 5G leadership is a national priority for many countries because the winner is expected to secure more than a decade of competitive advantages. The spread of 5G is pivotal for the connected world — its technical upgrades will supercharge adoption of transformative technologies and strengthen the value of old ones. Now, as 5G takes center stage in the developing world, emerging markets have been making a concerted effort to prepare for the transition to the next-generation network. 5G will serve as the backbone of the fourth industrial revolution, and the global pacesetter for the new standard could become the same for connected technologies.",SKM,en,Business Insider

2019-08-08 08:22:42-05:00,India and Brazil's massive 5G spectrum auctions in 2020 will set pricing examples for future rollouts,"While 5G networks start to roll out in advanced markets like South Korea, the US, the UK, and Germany, other countries' telecoms are waiting for their chance to buy spectrum and get their own networks up and running. Two key markets that will be moving on 5G in the next year are India and Brazil. News about their upcoming auctions and the network rollouts to follow is likely to have major implications for companies looking to do business related to those deployments, as well as for 5G activities in other markets. Here's what's happening in Brazil and India: Nokia expects Brazil's 5G auction next year to be among the largest — if not the largest — spectrum sales ever, according to Reuters . Anatel, the Brazilian telecommunications regulator, is organizing the country's first 5G spectrum auction, set for March 2020. Telecoms will bid on 2.3 GHz and 3.5 GHz spectrum, and Anatel is also considering adding the 700 MHz and 26 GHz bands to the auction. This means that all of Brazil's 5G spectrum could be up for grabs at once, which Nokia Latin America CTO Wilson Cardoso told Reuters could make for the largest single 5G auction worldwide.",SKM,en,Business Insider

Each company will maintain a 37.5% stake in the tower-operating venture and have the option to reduce their stakes down to 25% in order to attract new outside investors, meaning they'll retain joint control over Inwit regardless of investment. Each network operator paid around €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion) for 5G spectrum during Italy's auction last year. The tie-up between Vodafone Italia and TIM is just the latest in a spate of network-sharing agreements between telecoms in recent months.

South Korea switched on 5G networks nationwide in April, with data speeds of about 1.5 gigabits per second. Businesses are counting on 5G to deliver artificial-intelligence-based robots, 3D content, and holograms that they say will someday be a part of people’s daily lives. The higher speeds will enable companies including automakers and wireless carriers to connect devices with vehicles, home appliances, and buildings. And because the country also boasts the world’s highest robot density, some of these same companies, such as Hyundai, LG, and Samsung, are trying to develop bots that will provide some fixes for problems like a rapidly aging population and rising labor costs. The global market for service robots is projected to expand to $20.2 billion by 2021, from $8.6 billion in 2017, according to the Frankfurt-based International Federation of Robotics.",SKM,en,Bloomberg
