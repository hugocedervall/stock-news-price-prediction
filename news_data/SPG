The expansion will allow the e-commerce giant to take on Target and Walmart. ""The facilities, which will eventually number about 1,500, will bring products closer to customers, making shopping online about as fast as a quick run to the store. It will also help the world's largest e-commerce company take on a resurgent Walmart."" The small warehouses would support Amazon's efforts to provide customers with two-day and or one-day deliveries for specific items, even if a demand surge is seen. The primary strategy here is to compete with Walmart and Target's same-day delivery schemes. Bloomberg explains the strategy behind additional micro warehouses: ""Historically, Amazon gnawed away at brick-and-mortar rivals from warehouses on the exurban fringes, where it operated mostly out of sight and out of mind.",SPG,en,Zero Hedge

In fact, Payless ShoeSource filed for bankruptcy in February and said it planned to close all of its 2,500 stores in what could be the largest retail liquidation in history. Some of these companies will continue to close stores in 2020, but others are expected to announce new closures as well. This is not being offset by store openings either, as only 3,500 stores have opened their doors in 2019, according to the Motley Fool.

Just three of them, or 15%, actually contained what the labels said, according to the results of the study exclusively shared with Business Insider. Some of the products also contained ""dangerously high"" levels of solvents, Aaron Riley, CannaSafe's CEO said in an interview. The test results point to the challenges of meeting the huge demand for a product that was illegal just months ago. It's no secret that CBD is booming. The non-psychoactive component of cannabis has shown up in products from face masks and lotions to cupcakes and infused lattes. And some CBD brands have even inked deals with mainstream pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens to sell CBD topicals on shelves. Analysts at the investment bank Cowen expect the CBD market to grow from around $1 billion today to upwards of $16 billion by 2025 .

But unfortunately for America's struggling retailers, many missed out on the sales bonanza as Amazon and other e-commerce platforms accrued nearly all of the sales growth while foot traffic at US malls was stagnant. Already, Kohl's and Macy's have helped crush the narrative of the strong consumer by slashing their earnings guidance, something that doesn't bode well for Q4 GDP , thanks to what we warned would be an unsustainable inventory build up that has inflated growth numbers in recent quarters. The retail space has already seen the first headline-grabbing retail bankruptcy of the year (see: Gymboree ). And as Bloomberg warned in a story published this week, even after high-profile bankruptcies including Sears and Toys R' Us , the ""retail apocalypse"" is far from over. Though the Fed has capitulated to the whims of the market, retailers still make up about one-fifth of the universe of distresses borrowers.
