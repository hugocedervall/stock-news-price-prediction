As the vanguards of the digital transformation of healthcare, investors are taking notice of digital health startups' potential—and committing record funds to them. Globally, healthcare funding to private firms reached $18.09 billion in Q2 2020, according to CB Insights—establishing a new quarterly record, with equity investments growing 6.3% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) from 1,197 deals in Q1 2020 to 1,272 deals in Q2 2020.

This news arrives on the heels of Olive's $225 million funding round that vaulted it to unicorn status at an overall valuation of $1.5 billion . Olive's tech could help abate the physician burnout crisis that's been exacerbated amid the pandemic. Physicians often spend hours going back-and-forth between a patient's health insurance company to approve a procedure, and that contributed to the US' physician burnout crisis: 89% of providers reported that the burden of obtaining a prior authorization was ""high"" or ""extremely high,"" per an analysis published this month by the American Hospital Association (AHA). And while some major payers like Cigna recently waived some prior authorizations to ease doctors' burdens amid the pandemic, this hasn't been sweeping—and short-staffed hospitals haven't been able to keep up with admin tasks amid influxes of patients.",CI,en,Business Insider

While telehealth has been on the brink of taking off for years, consumer usage of the tech ticked up slowly before 2020. The coronavirus pandemic has given consumers the push they need to adopt telemedicine on a wide scale — and we expect adoption to keep climbing so long as the pandemic rages on.

2020-12-03 10:40:02-05:00,"Hot health insurance startups Oscar, Clover, and Bright are expanding across the US. Their results so far this year reveal how difficult that can be.","Summary List Placement Venture capital-backed health insurance startups are rapidly expanding their footprints across the US in hopes of shaking up a sector dominated by veteran companies like Anthem, Cigna and UnitedHealthcare. Some of these startups, including Oscar Health and Clover Health, are pushing into new cities and states in 2021. Others, like Bright Health, are launching into new business lines like employer-sponsored health plans. Business Insider combed the financial reports of five young insurers vying for a piece of the lucrative, but crowded insurance sector. The financials were lodged at the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and California's Department of Managed Health Care, or were provided by the companies. The startups reported mixed results in the first nine months of 2020, a period rocked by the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted patients to put off doctor's appointments and other medical care.

The 6-year-old startup mainly works with self-funded employers and health plans to help patients figure out their symptoms and the type of medical care they need. It's paid by insurers based on monthly users, and has raised $66.5 million to date. Those without insurance can take a free assessment on Buoy's website, which recommends care options based on their geography and symptoms. Following the surge in virtual care, insurers are focused on which of these vendors can actually reduce costs and improve health outcomes, not just take normal doctors' visits online. After the cost strains of the past few quarters — layoffs have plagued Nike, Uber, Disney, and other mega companies — employers that pay for care are increasingly picky about which digital health startups they work with, according to the Pacific Business Group on Health.",CI,en,Business Insider

The startup is just the latest in a long line of companies hoping to unseat pharmacy benefits managers, or PBMs. These companies negotiate discounts to prescription drugs at pharmacies like Walgreens on behalf of health insurers and employers and operate largely behind-the-scenes in the eyes of the average patient. But for startups hoping to drive down drug prices, PBMs are almost always the 800-pound gorilla in the room. Three PBMs — CVS Health's Caremark, UnitedHealth Group's OptumRx, and Cigna's Express Scripts — control nearly 75% of the $335 billion market , according to Becker's Hospital Review . WithMe started out by focusing on disrupting the classic PBM business model. Instead of making money off of rebates or dispensing fees, WithMe had planned to get paid a fixed fee for each of its members each month and allow employers to keep tabs on the transactions that get processed to make sure they're not taking any additional money.",CI,en,Business Insider

2020-11-19 04:35:42-05:00,5 Ways To Tackle Our Tiredness When We're All Doing So Little,"If there’s one thing that 2020 has taught us, it’s that pandemics are exhausting. Dr Sumera Shahaney, head of clinical operations at Thriva who also works in the UK’s NHS, has witnessed a rise in what is often referred to as ‘pandemic fatigue’. “This is usually felt as an inner weariness or worthlessness – many of the things you might associate with mild depression,” explains Dr Shahaney, who says she often sees this associated with feelings of hopelessness about the pandemic. “Many people have now accepted that life has changed,” she adds, “but we have lost resilience – we have no control over the future and are unable to see an end point.” On top of that, we’re entering the winter months , meaning fewer daylight hours to be had (and a drop in vitamin D levels), which can make us feel tired. We’re also more stressed generally, engaging in an awful lot of screen time, moving about far less, and plenty of us are having a rubbish night’s sleep to boot. And then there’s our social lives, which are completely lacking.",CI,en,HuffPost India

Tyler Durden Wed, 11/18/2020 - 16:24 Authored by Micha Gartz via The American Institute for Economic Research, ""It’s Now Up to Governors to Slow the Spread ,” says a Wall Street Journal article — written by board members of pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Illumina, Johnson and Johnson and Cigna. It encourages states and governors to band together and implement restrictions “focus[ed] on known sources of spread, such as bars and nightclubs.” Drs. Gottlieb and McClellan’s plea sounds reasonable. After all, ‘the science’ tells us that Covid spreads in confined spaces. Basing policy advice on ‘the science’ would be the sensible thing to do. These spaces — the restaurants, bars and cafes we enjoy — must be closed for our protection. But there’s just one small problem: ‘the science’ isn’t really there. In fact, the only evidence we have is circumstantial: all we have are data simulations (in other words, predictions), case studies followed up with contact tracing, and… that’s it.",CI,en,Zero Hedge

That same year Amazon also aligned itself with Berkshire Hathaway Inc., and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to form the Haven Healthcare venture to stem employer-health care spending, although turnover at the alliance has kept any major disruption to health-care companies at bay.For drug stores, Amazon’s move is “net negative and will likely bring back conversations about the appropriate multiples despite recent positive news about the role of drug stores in coronavirus vaccine distribution,” Evercore ISI analyst Elizabeth Anderson said in a note. “This will likely create an overhang for the group until we determine the take up of Amazon Pharmacy.”Walgreens Boots sank as much as 10%, Rite Aid plunged 17% and CVS Health dropped 8.5%.AmerisourceBergen Corp., Amazon and PillPack’s distributor, should benefit from the shift online, Anderson said.",CI,en,Yahoo Finance

The FDA nod underscores the agency's digital health-friendly stance—especially in making room to fast-track development of digital mental health tools amid the pandemic.

Here are the biggest obstacles each one faces.,"Major corporations and small business owners are trying to figure out what the future of the pharmacy business looks like. CVS Health and Walgreens, the two biggest pharmacy chains in the US, are taking very different approaches. CVS in 2018 acquired health insurer Aetna and has plans to massively roll out health-centered stores, in a bet that going deeper into healthcare will be the way forward. ""What we're witnessing is the evolution of the drugstore from what it's been to what it needs to be to meet the needs of consumers,"" CVS CEO Larry Merlo told Business Insider. Walgreens has bet far less of its future on healthcare, and its stock is slumping. On Monday, Bloomberg reported that private-equity firm KKR has formally approached Walgreens in talks to go private. Should that happen, it could give Walgreens breathing room to figure out what its evolution looks like, though it faces a number of challenges.

Consumers with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) — a rare form of blood-cell cancer — who were equipped with CVS' two-way messaging app for medication adherence were 22% more likely to stay on course with their drug regimens than those without the app, FierceHealthcare reports . CVS likely targeted CML patients because medication adherence is key to stifling progression of the condition: 90% medication adherence or better in the first year post-diagnosis significantly increases patients' chances at readmission. CVS has kicked its efforts to fuel improved health outcomes into high gear since fusing with health insurance titan Aetna, and now it's tackling specialty pharmacy — one of the industry's costliest qualms.
