The benchmark leak says the Galaxy S21 will not outperform the 2019 iPhone 11 phones, let alone the iPhone 12. Samsung is widely expected to launch the Galaxy S21 series in early 2021, about a month earlier than expected. Qualcomm unveiled the Snapdragon 888 platform earlier this week, which will power many Android flagships next year that will compete directly with the iPhone 12 series. The US chipmaker said the CPU will be 25% faster and 25% more efficient than the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865, while the GPU will deliver 35% performance gains and a 20% drop in energy consumption. Qualcomm also mentioned several smartphone vendors that will use the Snapdragon 888 in the future, including LG, Motorola, and OnePlus. Notably absent from the list were Samsung, prompting speculation that Samsung might not use the 888 platform for some of its upcoming Galaxy S21 versions.",MSI,en,BGR

Qualcomm has just announced the Snapdragon 888 system-on-chip (SoC), revealing the various features the chip will support and the partners that will use it in 2021 Android flagships. The announcement delivered a few surprises, including a few exciting revelations about the capabilities of the chip. But Qualcomm’s new processor might not be used on future Samsung and Google devices. Apple’s newly released iPhone 12 series features the world’s best smartphone processor , taking the crown from its predecessor. The iPhone 11 is still faster in benchmark and speed tests than any 2020 Android flagships and comes second only to the iPhone 12. Furthermore, a version of the 5nm A14 Bionic inside the new iPhone series is powerful enough for MacBooks. That’s the M1 series chip that outperforms most PCs out there, whether they’re based on Intel, AMD, or ARM.

Before landing in Cedar Rapids at JET Engineering a few years ago, Helena Long spent 15 years traveling the country as a human resources and training consultant for Fortune 500 companies like Motorola, Dell and Ford Motor Company that had employees scattered all over the country — even the globe. Now serving as JET Engineering’s vice president of human resources and leadership development, she said many of the people she has worked with over the years never met their coworkers in person. Some of the struggles they faced might sound familiar to those working remotely for the first time. “Communication was always a challenge. Building trust was also an issue,” she said. Long came up with creative solutions designed to make employees feel connected. For example, she’d ask people to share personal tidbits of information, like their favorite board game, at the beginning of a meeting.

However, company founder Elon Musk has hinted the project is not out of the woods yet in terms of its economics. Over the past 18 months, SpaceX has launched nearly 900 Starlink spacecraft into low-Earth orbit , scooped up big contracts with the military and Microsoft , and even opened a public beta test program. With any luck, SpaceX executives think they can bring online the floating high-speed network within a few months.

Now, companies like Samsung, Huawei, Microsoft, and Motorola are racing to figure out what comes next by launching phones that can bend and fold into different forms. But Apple is nowhere to be found. There are several good reasons why Apple hasn't entered the foldable phone market just yet. Foldable phones have barely been on the market for a year. And during that time, it's become clear that phone makers are still ironing out the kinks and growing pains that come with developing a new type of computer. Take Microsoft as an example. The PC giant's anticipated $1,400 Surface Duo, which has two screens joined together by a folding hinge, received middling reviews for its buggy software and lackluster camera. But perhaps the most obvious signal that foldable phones are not yet ready for prime time is their launch cycles.

The Surface Duo consists of two 5.6-inch screens joined by a 360-degree hinge, which makes it more versatile than competing foldable smartphones from Samsung or Motorola. That means you can use it in a variety of modes, such as holding it open like a book when reading, or propping it up like a tent on your table when using it as a second screen. But, for the price, it falls short in certain areas where more traditional smartphones excel, such as the camera. Microsoft's original Surface popularized the idea that a tablet computer could replace the traditional laptop following its 2012 launch. Now, the tech giant is hoping to make similar waves in the smartphone market with the launch of its Surface Duo, a $1,400 Android smartphone that, as its name implies, has two screens. It's available starting September 10. The Surface Duo is Microsoft's take on the foldable phone, a trend that smartphone giants like Samsung, Huawei, and Motorola spearheaded in 2019.","MSFT,MSI",en,Business Insider

We are currently testing more budget phones and look forward to reviewing the new ones that are set to launch in 2020 and have released already. Although most people in the US tend to buy their smartphones directly from cell service providers (carriers) like AT&T , Verizon , and T-Mobile , bargain hunters and tech geeks seek out budget unlocked phones online because they are affordable yet offer incredible value for the money.

Samsung, Motorola, and Huawei have managed to pull this off with varying degrees of success. The phones are still prohibitively expensive, but they exist.

Apple, meanwhile, has a penchant for patience. In other words, there's no reason to believe that Apple will jump into the world of foldable phones until there's evidence that a) consumers want such a form factor and b) the form factor proves to be beneficial. That said, some of the early reviews of the Motorola Razr and the Galaxy Flip Z suggest that foldable phones may be nothing more than a passing fad.

2020-02-05 09:43:32-05:00,Apple has an idea for a foldable iPhone that could solve a problem with bendable smartphones from Samsung and Huawei (AAPL),"Apple has been granted another patent that suggests it may be experimenting with foldable devices, coming after major smartphone makers like Samsung, Huawei, and Motorola have already debuted their first wave of foldable smartphones. The new patent, originally filed in August 2016 and first reported by MacRumors , covers a hinge mechanism for a foldable gadget that could include retractable panels. These moveable flaps would be deployed when the device is unfolded to cover the gap between the two portions of the display housing, and would retract when the gadget is in a bent state. Since these retractable flaps would be capable of covering the gap between the display housings when the device is unfolded, this suggests that a phone or tablet using this hinge mechanism would have a minimal crease when unfolded. That would potentially improve on designs from Samsung and Huawei, which both make foldable phones that have a visible crease when unfolded. Here's how the technology is described in Apple's patent, which is dated February 4: ""With another arrangement, the housing may have moveable flaps that extend parallel to the bent axis.",MSI,en,Business Insider

Published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office today, the patent explains that the hinge mechanism would ensure adequate separation between the first and second portions of the display. When the device is unfolded, movable flaps would extend to cover the gap, and then retract when the device is folded. Early foldable smartphones like Samsung's Galaxy Fold and Huawei's Mate X have noticeable creases along the bending portion of the display. Motorola's new foldable Razr avoids this issue with a unique hinge design, but early reviews indicate the device makes creaking sounds when opened or closed. All in all, it is still early days for foldable smartphones, with lots of room for innovation. Apple has certainly shown an interest in the category with several patents for foldable devices and mechanisms over the past few years, but it remains to be seen if the company ever releases a foldable iPhone or iPad.",MSI,en,Mac Rumors

Add to that a 2019 flagship processor, and the Z Flip is a much better offer than the mid-rang Razr clamshell. These are just rumors for the time being, but the video below can at least confirm the Z Flip’s design. Posted on Twitter by leaker/designer Ben Geskin, the video below shows someone operating the phone with one hand. The person can easily fold and unfold the handset and flip it around. https://twitter.com/BenGeskin/status/1223926886658605056 The device is quite tall, certainly taller than initially believed, and it’s reminiscent of Sony’s 2019 Xperia flagships, although those handsets do not fold.",MSI,en,BGR.com

For starters, it's a clamshell device just like the 2020 Razr, which will make it a lot easier to carry around. Secondly, the phone is supposed to feature better specs than the Razr, and it's said to be cheaper than both Motorola's foldable and Samsung's Galaxy Fold. But the Galaxy Z Flip's best rumored feature concerns the screen quality. And Samsung may have just confirmed the one feature that we were most excited might be present on the Z Flip. The Galaxy Fold's chief problem, even after it was redesigned, is the plastic screen. It's so fragile that Samsung will warn you to handle it with care so you don't accidentally scratch or pierce it. The Z Flip might not have the same problem, several reports have suggested in the past few months. The handset will feature a thin layer of glass on top of the OLED display which should make the entire screen assembly a lot more resistant to damage.",MSI,en,BGR.com

Samsung needed to redesign a few key aspects of the Fold to make sure the handset wouldn’t be destroyed on the first day of use, which is exactly what happened during the first week of reviews last April. Those experiences sent Samsung back to the drawing board, and the end result was a phone that still shipped with multiple warnings inside the box. The screen of the $2,000 phone was the most susceptible to breaking, which is because it’s not made of glass, but instead of a polymer that can be scratched and pierced with relative ease. While Samsung might permanently fix that with the Galaxy Z Flip phone that should be unveiled next month, Motorola may have a similar problem with its new Razr.

Here's a look at how those predictions fared. We missed the mark on two key predictions last year: Foldable phones weren't a hit with consumers this year. We expected that foldable phones would see a spike in popularity, given that consumers continue to purchase smartphones with larger screens and are using them for digital activities that were traditionally done on large-screen devices like laptops and tablets. While an array of smartphone vendors including Samsung, Huawei, and Motorola introduced their own foldable smartphones, consumers weren't quick to gravitate towards them. For instance, Samsung expects to sell only 500,000 units of the Galaxy Fold this year — a fraction of the nearly 294 million handsets it sold in 2018.

But many of the upgrades that have appeared on mobile devices in recent years have felt more iterative than innovative. That started to change in 2019, as major smartphone brands like Samsung, Apple, and OnePlus started bringing new features to mobile devices that add meaningful improvements or changes to the ways in which we use our mobile devices. From ultra-wide-angle lenses to cameras that pop out when needed and disappear when they're no longer in use, here are the trends that dominated the smartphone industry in 2019.",MSI,en,Business Insider

Here are a few ways companies are looking to add tech to push consumers to upgrade their devices heading into 2020. Chinese smartphone manufacturer Vivo is looking to use AI-powered 5G devices to drive growth in India. The company reached 21% market share in India in October 2019, its highest-ever level in the country, and is looking to build on that momentum with greater use of AI to better serve users' needs.",MSI,en,Business Insider

2019-11-14 13:11:22-05:00,"The 5 coolest features of Motorola's new $1,500 Razr phone","Motorola just announced a new version of its iconic Razr flip phone from the early 2000s. The new Razr has a foldable screen, but maintains a design that's very similar to the original. Based on what we know about the new Razr, it seems like it could offer some benefits over rival foldable phones , like the Samsung Galaxy Fold and Huawei Mate X. Its flip-phone-inspired design feels more natural to use, and the crease where the screen folds doesn't seem as noticeable, for example. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. It's 2019, and the flip phone is making a comeback. Motorola is reviving its iconic Razr flip phone from the early 2000s with a very modern day twist. Yes, it's still a flip phone like you probably remember. But the new version trades out the original Razr's sleek keypad and tiny screen for a high-resolution touch screen that stretches across the entire device and folds in half. It's available for preorder on December 26 through Verizon for $1,500, and is launching in January.",MSI,en,Business Insider
2019-11-14 12:57:30-05:00,Motorola's new foldable Razr solves a problem with smartphones we didn't know we had,"Motorola's new Razr foldable smartphone was announced on Wednesday evening. It's a full-sized smartphone that folds down into something smaller and more compact. It's addressing a problem we don't know we had — that smartphones take up as much space when we're not using them as when we use them. Foldable smartphones that turn into something bigger, like Samsung's Galaxy Fold , are cool, but they're addressing a desire more than solving a problem. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . Out of all the foldable smartphones we've seen so far — which I can count on a single hand — Motorola's new Razr looks like it has the best shot at gaining traction because it solves a problem we didn't know we had. The problem is that 99% of smartphones today take up as much space in our pockets and bags when we don't need them as when we're using them in our hands. The new Razr flips open like the original one did years ago, but the new version now has a long foldable screen that extends from the top of the phone to the bottom.",MSI,en,Business Insider

Oh, but in reality, it's expensive and almost certain to be laden with compromises, not least of all its subpar-looking and inherently fragile display. It's a familiar tale for anyone who follows tech news even a little, thanks to Samsung's high-profile Galaxy Fold fiasco , and it's starting all over again with the latest overhyped entry to the foldable phone fold: the new Motorola Razr , which brings the classic flip-phone form back with a 2019 twist and a $1,500 price tag. The phone goes on sale December 26th and is available for now only in the U.S. and only on Verizon — another throwback to a bygone era of mobile technology, though one that's perhaps a tad less endearing.
