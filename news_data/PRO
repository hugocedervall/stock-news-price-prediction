2020-09-03 01:00:03-05:00,The Andorra Hustle review – pulsating exposé of international corruption,"A heist-movie mood propels this rigorous doc about the role of an obscure bank in a US plan to undermine Catalan separatism The subject of Eric Merola’s film at first seems small: how a private bank in the tiny mountain nation of Andorra found itself at the centre of a conspiracy. But its real interests are wide-reaching: the tactics used by the US government to disrupt Catalonia’s independence movement, and the modern face of American interventionism. The hustle hinges on the murky section 311, a provision in the US Patriot Act that grants the Treasury Department sweeping powers in relation to any bank in the world, under the guise of protecting the world’s financial system. In 2015, the provision was used against Banca Privada d’Andorra (BPA ) on the grounds that it was being used to launder hundreds of millions of dollars on behalf of criminal gangs in Russia, China and Venezuela.

2020-08-26 20:01:46-05:00,Pick up Some Values in Small-Cap Stocks,"Whatever happened to small-cap stocks? The argument for smaller companies used to be simple: Their shares are riskier, on average, than shares of larger companies, but they return more to investors. So, more risk, more reward. That’s a rock-solid principle of investing (and of life, for that matter). Though small-cap stocks may be too volatile for some investors, a small injection of small caps can give a portfolio a nice boost. SEE MORE 12 Splendid Small-Cap Growth Stocks to Buy One advantage of a stock with a small market capitalization (defined as price times shares outstanding) is that, being small, it may elude the attention of analysts and most investors. Such a stock can be an overlooked bargain. Another plus is that, with a small cap, you have a chance to make gigantic returns on your original investment. If you had bought Netflix (symbol, NFLX ) in 2008, when it was a small-cap stock trading at about $4 a share, and you had held it until today, you would have increased your initial investment by a factor of more than 100.","PRO,PRI",en,Kiplinger Washington Editors

This move appears to be Canada’s answer to getting rid of waste plastic in the environment. In an article that appeared in the Globe and Mail newspaper on March 11, journalist Kathryn Blaze Baum wrote that Bob Masterson, the president and CEO of the Chemistry Industry Association of Canada, “is disappointed the government is poised to go that route.” He has been “urging federal officials instead to amend CEPA’s pollution-prevention provisions or introduce stand-alone legislation.” However, Baum stated in her article that “in a minority parliament, it is considered more expedient for the government to use the existing act than to curry multiparty support for new legislation regulating plastics.” Expedient being the operative word in that statement. Toxic substances are defined under CEPA as “those that cause, or may cause, immediate or long-term harm to the environment, biological diversity or human health.” Canada’s list of toxic substances includes greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane; mercury; asbestos; lead; formaldehyde; and bisphenol A (BPA) used in some plastics, according to Baum’s article.",PRO,en,PlasticsToday

Just two of the biggest tech companies, Apple and Microsoft, brought in a whopping 15% of the total return on the S&P 500 last year. It was truly an impressive performance. But for return-minded investors, the tech giants are not the only game in town.
