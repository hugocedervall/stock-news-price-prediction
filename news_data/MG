Tesla was founded 17 years ago, during a period when electric-vehicles were considered an incredibly risky undertaking. By 2010, Tesla had developed enough momentum to stage an IPO, raising about $260 million — a modest sum, given the hundreds of millions, even billions, that EVs startups have recently pulled in. Tesla then had to manufacture vehicles, sell them, and generate revenue (and, from time to time, profits). It muddled through many crises along the way. But in 2020, after an epic stock-market rally, became the world's most valuable automaker. Newer car companies have paid attention to the Tesla story and attempting to follow a less unpredictable path. Henrik Fisker, who established a rivalry with Tesla in the 2010s with Fisker Automotive before the operation went bankrupt in 2013, is back with a new brand, Fisker, and a rather different business model.","MGA,MG",en,Business Insider
