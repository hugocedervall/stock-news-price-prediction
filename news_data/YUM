That's the conclusion of a team lead by RBC Strategist Sara Mahaffy. After poring over the holdings of both traditional and environmental, social, and governance-focused hedge funds, she writes that the stocks ESG funds liked the best in the second quarter are pulling off a difficult trifecta in 2020. They fared very well during the two major sell-offs of the year — they outperformed during the coronavirus crash in February and March, beat the market dramatically during the March-through-September rally, and stayed above water during the slump that overtook the market after its record high on September 2. Since then the S&P 500 has dropped 6.1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq endured a 10% correction. The bulk of ESG hedge funds' new picks fared better. Overall, their 2020 relative return compared to the S&P 500 stood at 11.7% on September 25. It's been part of a good run of stock-picking for ESG funds, as Mahaffy also notes that stocks popular with those funds but less-liked by traditional hedge funds are also significant winners. ""Names that are only popular in sustainable funds outperformed,"" Mahaffy wrote, adding that the stocks aren't especially expensive based on longer-term price metrics. ""Names that are only popular in sustainable funds are still trading below their early 2020 highs, though they have been inching up slowly in recent months."" The following stocks were bought by the largest number of actively managed fundamental hedge funds during the second quarter, when the market was on the comeback trail following the February-March drop.",YUM,en,Business Insider

NPC said in a filing in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas on Tuesday that it plans to accept bids on its 900 Pizza Hut locations from any potential buyers. Further, NPC said, it would consider bids from buyers that may not want to operate the locations as Pizza Huts — including the pizza chain's competitors. Selling the locations to competitors would wipe out nearly 20% of the Pizza Hut locations in the US, while simultaneously giving another chain a significant boost. But, NPC argued, it is fair and legal to do so in the pursuit of the best possible price for the company's assets.

Let’s start with the naughty ones. First in line are all the companies that abandoned the Plastics Industry Association (PLASTICS) out of fear they won’t be perceived by consumers as being “green” but, rather, in cahoots with the planet’s number one enemy. (It’s really too bad that PLASTICS changed its name from the former SPI acronym—it would have been less noticeable to the activist groups.) Dropping their membership in PLASTICS is one way these big brand owners can get the activist groups off their backs, at least for a while. There’s no guarantee that the anti-plastic activists will not pursue packaged consumer goods companies to the ends of the earth to get them to stop using plastic in any form. These companies caved to pressure from activist organizations that do not understand polymer science. By leaving the association, these consumer goods companies are also acknowledging that science means nothing in their business, even as most of these companies use science to develop their products.",YUM,en,PlasticsToday

2019-05-20 20:17:50-05:00,Urban India hasn’t stopped spending yet,"NEW DELHI | MUMBAI: Leading listed companies selling discretionary products ranging from apparel to fast-food have posted double-digit sales growth in the fourth quarter ended March, indicating strong latent demand, especially in urban markets despite an overall slowdown in groceries and daily essentials.While a few firms blamed high base for slowing same store sales growth (SSSG), they maintained that the market is still resilient, a rare note of hope and cheer amid mostly grim economic commentary.“It is unrealistic to expect 15-20% growth every quarter because the base keeps growing. I am not saying there is consumer weakness as yet and one quarter is not reflective of whether the market is weak or not,"" said Amit Jatia, vice chairman of Westlife Development that grew 12% in the quarter. “Consumer sentiment keeps moving up and down or due to volatility such as elections, but these are momentary things,” he told investors.The master franchisee of McD’s restaurants in the western and southern markets said higher value growth is reflective of better pricing power, which in turn helped up gross margin to 64.1% in the March quarter, highest ever for them.Growing in Times of Slowdown 69420377 A few companies within apparel and quick service restaurants segment also saw same store sales growth taper off to be similar to the broader consumption trend in a range of products from cars and two-wheelers to air-travel and fast moving consumer goods.However, unlike their peers in other sectors, they aren't attributing the quarterly performance to slowing demand as yet.FMCG, auto and two-wheelers are largely dependent on farm income growth that has been weak for over two years with prices having stayed low.",YUM,en,The Economic Times India

But step inside, and it quickly becomes clear that this is no ordinary KFC. Customers line up before a row of touchscreen kiosks, keying in orders while a camera scans their faces to process payment in less than a second. Downstairs, a robot arm whirs to life to prepare an ice cream cone. Diners can choose the joint’s background music via app and listen to a favorite tune while they eat. So far only a few hundred KFC locations have been similarly tricked out. But Yum China Holdings Inc. says 86 percent of transactions are already cashless and about half of orders are placed via mobile app or digital kiosk at its more than 8,400 KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell restaurants. The next step is to harvest data from the more than 180 million Chinese who belong to KFC and Pizza Hut loyalty programs and use artificial intelligence to customize a menu for each diner based on preferences and local tastes.","YUM,YUMC",en,Bloomberg
