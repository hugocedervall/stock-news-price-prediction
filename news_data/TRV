In a letter sent to the chief executives of the world's 30 largest insurance companies coordinated by the Insure Our Future campaign today, a raft of high profile green groups warned many insurers' nominal support for climate targets was undermined by their on-going contracts with the fossil fuel industry.

2019-07-03 08:23:21-05:00,A record number of Americans are estimated to hit the roads for the Fourth of July. Here are the places and times it will be the worst.,"A record number of Americans are estimated to hit the roads for Fourth of July. Low gas prices and a booming economy mean families have plenty of disposable income to invest in summer travel, AAA says. The group, along with the analytics firm INRIX, has calculated the most crowded places and times. Here's where traffic will be worst — and the best time to leave to avoid it. Wednesday, on the eve of the July 4 holiday, is set to be one of the busiest travel days of the year. AAA estimates that nearly 49 million Americans will hit the road to celebrate the Independence Day holiday, a 4.1% increase over last year's travel volumes and a new annual record. ""In addition to lower gas prices compared with last summer, broader economic fundamentals remain strong,"" the group said in a press release. ""Low unemployment, robust consumer spending, and rising disposable incomes are all encouraging more consumers to invest their hard-earned money in travel this summer."" Travelers won't just be clogging up highways from coast to coast, they'll also be heading to airports in a similarly record-breaking fashion, with 3.96 million people expected to fly and another 3.55 million expected on trains, buses, and cruise ships.",TRV,en,Business Insider

2019-04-09 16:02:00-05:00,How crowdsourcing shipping through technology will make last mile delivery cheaper (AMZN),"The proliferation of e-commerce has transformed free shipping and same-day delivery from perks to table stakes — and retailers are paying the price. With daily parcel volumes surging and customers increasingly unlikely to foot the bill, companies have been tasked with finding new ways to offer speedy shipments without eating costs. Among the most popular strategies is crowdsourced delivery, the Uber model helping online shops solve the most expensive part of shipping: the last mile problem . Like Uber and other ride hailing apps, a number of crowdsourced delivery solutions have been cropping up over the past few years to ease these pains by connecting customers directly with local couriers. And it’s not just startups either; Amazon, the world's undisputed e-commerce leader, is investing big in crowdsourcing deliveries. How much does Amazon spend on shipping? “Free shipping” comes at a high cost. According to Amazon’s 2017 annual report , the company spent $21.7 billion in shipping last year — a number that includes sortation, delivery center, and transportation costs.",TRV,en,Business Insider
