2020-06-28 05:08:36-05:00,It’s time to wave goodbye to bonanza crude oil trade,"By Firat KayakiranAn oil trade that made its way into Donald Trump’s press briefings -- and earned big profits for commodity merchants and tanker owners alike -- is fading away with every dollar that the price of crude rallies.When oil demand cratered earlier this year because of the coronavirus and a flood of cargoes, the U.S. president talked about “oil all over the oceans.” It was a reference to the tens of millions of barrels of unwanted crude that traders were hoarding on ships at profit. Tanker owners including Frontline Ltd. and Euronav NV also reaped windfalls as a frenzy to book the ships on storage charters drove up rates.Those days are done. The big financial incentive to store, known in trader jargon as contango, has all but vanished. Worse still for tanker owners: it’s disappeared partly because the OPEC+ oil-producer alliance has drastically curtailed the supply of cargoes. In other words, no incentive to store and fewer shipments.“For now, this play is largely over,” said Richard Matthews, an analyst who monitors the trade at E.A.",FRO,en,Economic Times India

2020-04-23 15:03:40-05:00,Iran Threat Looms As Tanker Market Booms,"It was October 2019, just six months ago, but ancient history for tanker trades. Rates for very large crude carriers (VLCCs, tankers that carry 2 million barrels of crude oil) spiked to $200,000 per day. Tension in the Middle East was a key driver. The threat that military action with Iran could halt tanker transits via the Strait of Hormuz spurred fear that oil prices could skyrocket. This prompted shippers to pull bookings forward, boosting VLCC demand and rates. The world has turned upside down since then. Today, low crude prices are driving tanker rates above $200,000 per day. As the coronavirus cripples oil demand, an unprecedented wave of petroleum is going to sea, whether intentionally for storage or unintentionally because cargo owners can't find anywhere to unload. The more laden tankers on the water, the fewer available to bid on the next spot deal and the higher the spot rate. If oil prices bounce back up, it would be negative for tanker sentiment — exactly the opposite of what happened in October.",FRO,en,Benzinga Feeds
2020-04-13 13:55:14-05:00,Massive OPEC+ Cuts Not Enough To Derail Tanker Earnings,"Never before has oil production been slashed this much this quickly, but it still isn't enough to offset coronavirus demand destruction. OPEC and cooperating non-OPEC countries such as Russia (a coalition known as OPEC+) will cut output by 9.7 million barrels/day (b/d) in May-June, 7.7 million b/d in July-December and 5.8 million b/d in January-April 2021. Coronavirus demand destruction is estimated to exceed 20 million b/d. Continued excess production will pull more tankers into use as floating storage, reducing the number of vessels bidding for spot voyage deals and prolonging historically high rates. ""In any other time, an output cut of this magnitude would be the death knell for the tanker industry,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Jon Chappell. ""But with the reductions failing to match the estimated demand destruction, inventories are still likely to build materially … pressuring near-term oil prices and incenting floating storage. ""Tanker stocks are the only place for energy capital before the demand/supply imbalance inflects,"" maintained Chappell.",FRO,en,Benzinga Feeds
2020-04-03 16:07:30-05:00,Roller-Coaster Ride Continues For Crude-Tanker Stocks,"It was all setting up so nicely for crude-tanker stocks until those Trump tweets on Thursday morning … Shares of companies that own very large crude carriers (VLCCs; tankers that carry 2 million barrels of crude) had been climbing steadily since early March, pulled upward by spot rates of over $200,000 per day and expectations for a spike in floating-storage contracts. Then, like a roller coaster that rumbles over the top of the slope and gathers speed on the other side, the stocks came back down. At 10:30 a.m. Thursday, the U.S. president tweeted that Saudi Arabia and Russia would cut production by 10 million barrels per day (b/d), then: ""Could be as high as 15 … GREAT news for everyone!"" Actually, not everyone. Reduced output equates to fewer VLCC cargoes and less future storage. Merely talking about production cuts can immediately incentivize tanker owners to accept lower rates. Between the tweets and Friday's closing bell, crude pricing rose 30% and VLCC stocks went in the opposite direction, despite the fact that VLCC spot rates still exceed $220,000 per day: DHT Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DHT ) fell 22%, Frontline Ltd. (NYSE: FRO ) 21%, Euronav (NYSE: EURN ) 16% and International Seaways, Inc. (NYSE: INSW ) 13%.",FRO,en,Benzinga Feeds
2019-11-27 17:35:30-05:00,"Tanker Bosses Give Thanks For Six-Figure Rates, Order Drought","Crude-tanker rates made headlines around the world in early October for briefly shooting into the stratosphere, reportedly topping $300,000 per day. What's happening now is not garnering the same press, but it could be even more bullish for tanker companies: Rates have persistently stayed above $60,000 a day through most of the fourth quarter and are back above the $100,000-a-day mark. The attention-grabbing rate pinnacle on Oct. 11 wasn't entirely real. Rates reported that day were agreed ""on subjects,"" referring to an approval process before a final deal is struck. Sanity prevailed and those $300,000-a-day contracts evaporated; the highest rates actually achieved were closer to $200,000 a day. Just a handful of very large crude carriers (VLCCs, tankers that carry 2 million barrels of crude oil each) were actually in position to take advantage of the early October run-up, which had been sparked by charterer fears in the wake of the Saudi oil-facility attacks, the security threat to tankers in the Middle East and U.S. sanctions targeting Chinese ship owner COSCO.",FRO,en,Benzinga Feeds
