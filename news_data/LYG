Executing the vision will require billions of dollars in investments, the restructuring of teams, a reimagining of the entire banking technology stack, and the adoption of a far more customer-centric business view. The stakes of failing to transform are high: Accenture projects that 35% of all bank revenues could be at risk from more tech-savvy competitors like fintechs as soon as 2020 for incumbents that fail to up their game.","LYG,LYFT",en,Business Insider

The banking industry is in the grips of an identity crisis. Leaders of the world's largest banks — such as Citi, BBVA, and Goldman Sachs — have begun describing themselves as technology companies with banking licenses. However, this description is still aspirational. Executing the vision will require billions of dollars in investments, the restructuring of teams, a reimagining of the entire banking technology stack, and the adoption of a far more customer-centric business view. The stakes of failing to transform are high: Accenture projects that 35% of all bank revenues could be at risk from more tech-savvy competitors like fintechs as soon as 2020 for incumbents that fail to up their game. As a result, a wave of digital transformation is now sweeping the banking industry, as incumbents shore up against consumer demand and competitive pressures.","LYG,LYFT",en,Business Insider

Regulatory efforts in the UK are transforming retail banking, reshaping incumbents' relationships with customers, and easing entry for fintechs.

One of the main draws of this technology is the belief that cryptocurrency and stablecoins offer a genuine route out of the traditional centralised model of banking that epitomises fiat currency.

That is the core warning contained in an analysis today by EV100, the non-profit campaign that has seen growing numbers of major companies pledge to transition their road fleets to 100 per cent electric models over the next decade. Having first launched in 2017, the number of EV100 members has now more doubled over the past year from 31 to 67 firms across 80 markets, including five new joiners announced today: Lloyds Banking Group, Zenith, Schneider Electric, Lime, and Danfoss Group. Together these companies' commitments amount to 2.5 million EVs driving on the world's roads by 2030, even before consumer demand is considered, and that number is expected to rise rapidly as more firms shift their fleets to run on battery power in the coming years, according to The Climate Group, which runs the EV100 campaign.",LYG,en,BusinessGreen

APP scams are where people are duped into authorising a payment into the account of a scammer. Shieldpay says that victims of APP fraud get back 48% of their money on average. This means victims face a shortfall of £3 billion pounds in compensation received, while 15% get no compensation at all. <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!-- googletag.cmd.push(function() { var sizes = googletag.sizeMapping(); sizes.addSize([0, 0], [300, 250]) sizes.addSize([728, 90], []) sizes = sizes.build(); googletag.defineSlot(""/72546462/DFP-MW-inject-MPU1"", [300, 250], ""div-gpt-ad-Native1-0"") .defineSizeMapping(sizes) .addService(googletag.pubads()); googletag.pubads().setTargeting(""pos"", [""top""]); googletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest(); googletag.pubads().collapseEmptyDivs(); googletag.enableServices(); }); //--><!]]> <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!-- googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""div-gpt-ad-Native1-0""); }); //--><!]]> In most cases, victims of unauthorised fraud receive a full refund, however, those who have lost money due to APP scams do not receive the same protection.",LYG,en,MoneyWise

Johnson’s win laid to rest concerns about Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s radical plans to nationalise swathes of British industry and impose onerous rules on business, such as handing workers as much as 10% ownership in companies. Still, for many companies Brexit remains a worry, and executives urged Johnson to take his time and strike a business-friendly deal with the EU. “The prime minister must resist the urge for arbitrary negotiating deadlines,” said Jonathan Geldart, director general of the Institute of Directors. “The content and shape of any new deal are much more important than simply the speed in getting there.” Brexit aside, here’s why Johnson’s win looks like good news for specific parts of the economy.Finance and the cityMany investors feared that Corbyn’s plans to increase corporate taxes, raise the bank levy and give workers equity ownership would’ve led to capital outflows and damaged the City of London.",LYG,en,The Economic Times India
