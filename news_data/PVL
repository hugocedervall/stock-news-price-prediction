The Berkeley-based company emerged when SunPower wound down its project development business. Several former SunPower employees built a software tool to manage costs at the kinds of massive solar plants they used to develop: everything from site selection and layout to shipping logistics for millions of panels and the movements of laborers onsite. The ultimate goal is to find enough incremental cost savings across the board to bring the price of solar below one cent per kilowatt-hour in the next five years, said co-founder and CEO Matt Campbell. That would unlock terawatts of solar, making it cost-effective as baseload power in conjunction with longer duration storage—hence the company name. “Everything has progressed the way we thought it would,” he said of the software product. “Our thesis has been validated by clients, and we’re involved with a lot of real projects.” The startup raised seed funding of just under $2 million last year from individual investors and firms like Powerhouse Ventures, City Light Capital and Trancoso Partners.",PVL,en,Green Technology Media
