Today looks like another example as fresh vaccine news helped inject a positive tone. For the third Monday in a row, major indices started with enthusiasm as a major medical company shared solid effectiveness data. This time it’s AstraZeneca plc (NASDAQ: AZN ) saying the vaccine it’s developing with Oxford University has an average efficacy of 70% against COVID-19. This happened after a weekend when medical experts said it’s possible one or more vaccines could be available by mid-December. Last week began with a bang and then whimpered into the weekend amid shutdown concerns. Those haven’t gone away and could still be a barrier to big gains in this holiday-shortened stretch. These are tough times, even if the prospect of vaccines makes things a little less dark.

While it seems that most North American retailers won't have units in-store on launch day, an official Target Twitter account offers some hope. According to Target, if you buy a PS5 from the retailer and select either the pick-up in-store or drive-up option, you should be able to get your console from Target on launch day or thereafter, since the retailer will apparently have units to sell in those specific instances (so, no walk-up purchases). Anyone who wants to get their hands on Sony's next-generation gaming console in-store on the PS5 release date of November 12 -- well, we've already noted here that finding either the PS5 or PS5 Digital Edition in store will be a challenge.

Prime Day also seems to have driven ample first-party sales for Amazon: The Echo Dot was the most popular product purchased globally and the etailer sold millions of Alexa-compatible devices. But bringing in sales for third-party sellers, specifically small businesses, was clearly a focus for the firm this year since it invested $100 million to help small businesses for Prime Day and ran a promotion that gave consumers a credit if they bought from smaller sellers. Driving sales for smaller merchants could have helped Amazon fend off retailers that tried to compete for sales during Prime Day. Retailers including Best Buy , Target , and Walmart all ran their own promotions that overlapped with Prime Day, but they all lack the product selection Amazon can offer thanks to its massive third-party marketplace, though Walmart has been quickly building out its own marketplace through a partnership with Shopify.",BBY,en,Business Insider

2020-10-13 06:31:06-05:00,Google’s biggest Pixel innovation has a new home,"Google announced a brand new Nest Thermostat that incorporates one of the company's biggest innovations for its Pixel phones. The new smart home gadget comes with a built-in Soli radar system that will be used to detect motion inside the house. Data from the radar system combined with location-tracking information will allow the new Nest Thermostat to adjust energy consumption to prevent cooling or heating an empty room. Google needed two years to copy Apple’s 3D face recognition unlock that debuted with the iPhone X in 2017. Face ID is now available on all iPhones launched since then, except for the new iPhone SE and all iPod Pros. The Pixel 4 was the first and only Google phone to support 3D face recognition, and Google delivered an overkill upgrade for it. That’s the Project Soli radar system that detects the face or hands' presence and triggers specific actions. No matter how sophisticated it might be, Soli had little to show for on the Pixel 4. It ruined the phone’s design, as the radar system takes plenty of space at the top of the phone, and offered no real must-have gesture-based features.",BBY,en,BGR

The phone's Amazon voice-powered tech enables seniors to make calls and send texts—in addition to the device's urgent call button, which links a user directly to 24/7 access to care teams at telehealth company GreatCall. As more senior patients warm to virtual care, rolling out senior-focused telehealth tech should knock down lingering barriers to widespread adoption, like limited technology access and experience. The pandemic catalyzed rapid uptake of telehealth services for seniors as social distancing recommendations forced them to opt for virtual care in place of in-person visits: Telehealth adoption among seniors skyrocketed to 300% during the pandemic, according to a recent survey from healthinsurance.com . However, barriers like lack of smartphones or tech knowledge hindered other seniors from tapping these same services: For example, in April, primary care startup Oak Street Health pivoted to telephone visits after realizing that its seniors had difficulty acclimating to video-enabled telehealth, citing lack of smartphone access and discomfort with video visits as major hurdles to uptake.",BBY,en,Business Insider

2020-05-20 03:00:31-05:00,Telehealth’s future is bright. Here’s what it’ll look like in 2025,"You’re sitting at the table eating dinner when you receive a notification. A woman wearing a light blue top fills the screen of your phone with a video message. “Hello, this is Diane in Dr. Halpern’s office,” the woman says. “The computer saw that your blood sugar and heart rate numbers went out of range yesterday and today. I’d like you set up a quick virtual visit, okay?” That’s where telemedicine could be headed in the next five years or so. It won’t just be virtual—it’ll also be proactive, hyper-personalized, and data-driven. Lots of people are having their first experiences with telemedicine right now as a result of the pandemic. They like it, and they’ll very likely expect to be able to continue accessing healthcare in this way after COVID-19 is long gone. The healthcare industry is notoriously slow in adapting new technologies, but COVID-19 may prove to be telehealth’s watershed moment. “There honestly wasn’t much change from 2008 when I started . . . to really up until very recently,” says Doctor on Demand chief medical officer Ian Tong. “Then all of a sudden, not only have patients done this for the first time, but this is literally the first time that most doctors have had to even to think about it and were literally forced to change their models—in some cases overnight.” With a new wave of investment likely flowing into digital health startups, including telemedicine providers, it’s a good time to ask how exactly telehealth will change the way we receive medical care.",BBY,en,Fast Company

2020-05-18 13:01:00-05:00,"2020 is the worst year to buy a new smartphone, because 5G just isn't worth it yet","Android phones in 2020 are coming with 5G connectivity, which is raising the price of smartphones. 5G is technically already here, but it's only available in certain pockets of certain cities in the US. It's by no means a widespread network that everyone can connect to. Progress and innovation like 5G is good, and it's not unusual that it costs more. But, what's the point of paying for 5G tech if you can't connect to it yet? If Android phones of 2020 are looking too expensive for your taste, you can opt for slightly older and less expensive Android phones that don't come with 5G to hold you over until 5G becomes mainstream rather than novelty. I especially recommend the $500 OnePlus 7T from 2019. Android phone makers are coming out with some great smartphones in 2020 so far, but 5G is ruining the party. Indeed, 5G is making phones more expensive than ever before, where 5G tech like mobile processors, modems, and antennas are adding up to $200 extra to what smartphones used to cost in 2019. ""5G poses many more technical challenges compared to 4G,"" OnePlus CEO Pete Lau told Business Insider in an interview in March, ""prices across the supply chain, from raw materials to 5G chips, are all rising generally in the industry.""

2020-02-28 11:17:26-05:00,"Airline, Hotel, Casino Stocks Likely To Be In Focus As Coronavirus Worries Continue","What the market has been doing this week is repricing where it thinks earnings should be in light of the hit to global economic growth that is expected from the coronavirus. With the outbreak continuing to spread worldwide, the market is continuing its downward spiral this morning. The shunning of risk has also led to a selloff in oil and a fresh-all time low in the 10-year Treasury yield below 1.2%. With stocks taking such a beating this week, there may actually be a bit of a bump later today as some investors might want to buy the dip. But since market participants may not want to take as much risk into the weekend, we might see more selling into the close. One lesson investors might take from this week’s action: Take small bites. As much as we’d like to remove emotion from the equation when it comes to investing and trading decisions, emotion is of human nature. But taking an all-or-none approach has—historically anyway—been generally a suboptimal approach.

That’s not guaranteed, of course, especially the way stocks closed at their lows and continued heading lower after the bell rang in a wave of selling that blew things apart in the last hour. However, Thursday’s 4% losses—the steepest decline in the toughest week for stocks since the financial crisis of 2008—might have gotten things to a point where stocks are looking a bit oversold. In fact, there was an overwhelming imbalance of sell orders going into the close and obviously there’s not a lot of green on the board. The indices have fallen six days in a row and are now well into “correction” territory, down double-digits from recent highs. A good chunk of the S&P 500 (SPX) is now in bear territory, down 20% or more. The problem is that all week, anyone who’s taken a nibble has ended up getting slammed.

Some 1,332 spots were vacated between January and October, with October’s 172 turnovers leading all months since 2002, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Additional firings and retirements continued through December. Some attribute this accelerated turnover to the fallout from the #MeToo movement. Poor behavior has supplanted poor financial performance as the leading cause of dismissals, PriceWaterhouseCoopers said in May. Below are some of the biggest C-suite shake-ups and their reported causes. Alphabet Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) (NASDAQ: GOOG ) co-founder Larry Page resigned as CEO in December but will remain on the company’s board of directors. The transition to Sundar Pichai had begun years earlier, so Page’s downgrade after 21 years was hardly a surprise. AutoNation Carl Liebert headed AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN ) for just four months before being replaced by his CFO. The chairman of the board described Liebert as “not a good fit.” Bed, Bath & Beyond Activist investors pressured Steven Temares to step down in May amid a push to replace the whole board.","BBBY,BBY",en,Benzinga

2019-11-24 19:00:06-05:00,Your Sonos speaker might be the most eco-friendly device you own,"Over time, most gadgets slowly stop working well. They fail to hold a battery charge. Parts break. Many devices are nearly impossible or prohibitively expensive to repair. Plus, they’re not nearly as cool as new ones that were just released. Much of the electronics industry has bought into short life cycles for products. It’s a profitable business model: If things regularly break, customers have to come back and buy another one when their current cell phone or speaker or computer begins to fail. But this mindset that electronics should be built to last for a short period of time before being discarded has contributed to a colossal amount of e-waste. A 2019 report from the UN found that e-waste is the fastest-growing type of waste in the world ; in 2018 alone, 53.5 million tons of e-waste were dumped into landfills. How do you address this problem? The speaker company Sonos has a very simple solution, one that just might make your Sonos speaker one of the most environmentally friendly devices that you use: Make products that last for a very long time.",BBY,en,Fast Company

To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here. Among US internet users who expect to spend more with Amazon during the holidays in 2019 than they did in 2018, 52% expect Amazon to steal some of their sales from Walmart, while 32% said the same for Target, according to a report from Coresight Research sent to Business Insider Intelligence.

But tariffs on Chinese imports could force Amazon to raise prices, which would weaken its ability to steal sales. To account for the growing number of goods affected by tariffs, Amazon may need to raise prices on both its third-party and first-party goods.",BBY,en,Business Insider
