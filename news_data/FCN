The end result of all this, as Bloomberg puts it, is as follows: ""It’s not quite a new Cold War yet. Just the cold shoulder."" We explained earlier that in a nation that seems impossibly divided on most issues and is ideologically polarized more than ever in history, China is the one thing that more than two-thirds of Americans can agree on, and they agree that they simply do not like China. And the numbers absolutely bear that out: "" Some 40% of Americans said they won’t buy products from China , according to a survey of 1,012 adults conducted May 12-14 by Washington-based FTI Consulting, a business advisory firm."" Via WSJ Among the other results as summarized by Bloomberg, the poll found : 55% don’t think China can be trusted to follow through on its trade-deal commitments signed in January to buy more U.S. products 78% percent said they’d be willing to pay more for products if the company that made them moved manufacturing out of China 66% said they favor raising import restrictions over the pursuit of free-trade deals as a better way to boost the U.S. economy This could play big for President Trump just six months out from the November election, something he seems very cognizant of , given he provocatively told FOX last week that ties with Beijing could ultimately be severed altogether. “There are many things we could do — we could cut off the whole relationship ,” Trump said in the interview when asked about the new retaliatory visa measures targeting Chinese nationals, such as state media personnel and students.",FCN,en,Zero Hedge
