Consumers can use the centers to drop off returns for about two dozen participating brands, no packing label required.

The chief executives of the fitness chains Life Time and Self Esteem Brands — owner of Anytime Fitness, The Bar Method, and Basecamp Fitness — are calling upon lawmakers to reconsider the decision to close gyms in select states.

According to Bloomberg , GOP donors contributed $95 million to their party's Senate super-pac and party election committee between election day and Nov. 23 - over four times the $18 million Democrats contributed to similar groups over the same period. Granted, that time frame excludes much of the fervor over election fraud, or the fact that Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue are essentially never-Trump Republicans. Their Democratic opponents, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock have a much higher volume of donations - albeit in far smaller amounts contributed mostly online. Thanks to the massive contributions, the Georgia GOP has been able to ramp up expensive advertising - with the GOP candidates having booked $161.6 million in airtime vs. $118.3 million for Democrats, which came primarily from out of state.",HD,en,Zero Hedge

That’s where the numbers are. These people are being misled,” he explained. “It’s absolutely a fraud to suggest that the money that’s going to be needed is going to come from the rich or the super-rich.” Langone would add that the problem with going after the middle class with tax hikes is “you go after the backbone of the economy” and “we will have a bad recession” as a result. The Home Depot co-founder believes that the Biden team is well aware that the idea of generating enough revenue through taxing the rich will not work and that lower and middle-class Americans will find this out “when its too late.” Biden’s $4 trillion tax, to be implemented over the next ten years, was described as “the highest in American history - indeed, in world history” by Lew Uhler, chairman of the National Tax Limitation Committee, and Peter Ferrara a senior policy adviser to NTLF in their analysis published in The Hill .",HD,en,Zero Hedge

The Pixel 4 was the first and only Google phone to support 3D face recognition, and Google delivered an overkill upgrade for it. That’s the Project Soli radar system that detects the face or hands' presence and triggers specific actions. No matter how sophisticated it might be, Soli had little to show for on the Pixel 4.

The CEO shared one number that reveals why that approach is here to stay.,"The coronavirus pandemic has forced rooftop solar companies to move their sales online. In Sunrun's earnings call Wednesday, the firm said it has quickly moved to online sales in about a month. Under ordinary circumstances, the transition would have taken two years. Digital customer acquisition and sales will save Sunrun about $1,000 per customer, its CEO said. That's one reason why she said it would be ""a long term structural shift."" Shifting sales online requires more transparency around pricing and a slightly different skill set, one expert said. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . The last two months have been especially painful for the rooftop solar industry, which typically relies on face-to-face sales, onsite installations, and long-term financial commitments.

So far, many of the reports of pain have been anecdotal. But soon the industry’s public companies, including Sunnova, Sunrun, SunPower and Vivint Solar, will report their first set of earnings since the wide-ranging impacts of coronavirus landed in the U.S. The results should make clearer just how successful attempts have been to boost sales and keep installations moving, even as most of the country remains in lockdown. The third-ranking solar installer in the U.S., Tesla, has already reported its first-quarter earnings , detailing underwhelming solar installation numbers that undercut two quarters of consecutive gains. Tesla's solar installations dropped 26 percent from Q1 2019 to Q1 2020 and fell from 54 megawatts in Q4 2019 (usually the largest for solar installers) to 35 megawatts in Q1 2020.

Thus the Ministry is able to help us better understand the lock-down policy. We’ve been piling into crowded supermarkets for seven weeks buying food, and we are allowed to purchase liquor and lottery tickets. Those purchases are deemed safe by the state; however, it is critical for viral control that we not purchase sneakers or other hazardous items which pose a greater threat of proximity transmission.

Authored by John Whitehead via The Rutherford Institute, Cash may well become a casualty of the COVID-19 pandemic… As these COVID-19 lockdowns drag out, more and more individuals and businesses are going cashless (for convenience and in a so-called effort to avoid spreading coronavirus germs), engaging in online commerce or using digital forms of currency (bank cards, digital wallets, etc.). As a result, physical cash is no longer king. Yet there are other, more devious, reasons for this re-engineering of society away from physical cash: a cashless society—easily monitored, controlled, manipulated, weaponized and locked down—would play right into the hands of the government (and its corporate partners). To this end, the government and its corporate partners-in-crime have been waging a subtle war on cash for some time now. What is this war on cash? It’s a concerted campaign to shift consumers towards a digital mode of commerce that can easily be monitored, tracked, tabulated, mined for data, hacked, hijacked and confiscated when convenient.",HD,en,Zero Hedge

Billionaires in France , for example, saw their collective net worths soar, while the opposite happened in China. But billionaires in the US have been increasingly forced to contend with the prospect of a wealth tax .

As we approach the end of the year — and the decade – Business Insider took a look back at how things have changed for billionaires over the course of 2019. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. Depending on where you live and how you made your fortune, 2019 was either a very good year to be a billionaire — or a very bad one. French billionaires , for example, enjoyed surges in their net worths this year, while months of mass protests and political unrest sunk those of Hong Kong's billionaires .

Shopping season—a few days shorter than usual this year because of the late Thanksgiving date—already got underway a few weeks ago. Still, the rubber hits the road this Friday and next Monday, and those sales figures could reinforce signs of a healthy consumer or raise questions, depending on how things go. We should start getting a sense by as soon as Friday morning, since many sales start very early that day. Strong earnings results last week from some of the more closely watched retailers, including JW Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN ), Gap Inc (NYSE: GPS ), and Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE: FL ), certainly helped bring a holiday glow, though Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD ) and Macy’s Inc (NYSE: M ) didn’t do as well. The usual suspects are likely going to be front and center on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, including Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Target (TGT), Apple Inc.

Healthcare stocks led the way higher this week, while Energy names lagged. Looking ahead to next week, the retail sector will dominate the waning days of earnings season, led by Home Depot ( HD ), Macy’s ( M ) and Target ( TGT ). On one hand, equities are at all-time highs; but on the other, third-quarter earnings are on pace to decline from the previous year. On Thursday, strategists at Morgan Stanley chimed in on Thursday, about how they expect the next major market shift could play out: “We think Value's performance relative to Growth is bottoming after 13 years of underperformance. We see a two-step process that plays out over an extended investment horizon: Growth's underperformance drives Part 1, and then Value's outperformance drives Part 2. In between, there’s a recession. To be clear, our economists are not making a call on the timing of the next downturn. However, the current late-cycle environment isn't likely to last forever, and we believe that investors should look ahead to the coming regime shift.” Knowing what and when to buy can be challenging for any investor.",HD,en,Nasdaq

Whether we're talking about two-pizza meetings or CEO Jeff Bezos' demand for a slightly higher IPO listing price, there are dozens of stories of early Amazon setting the stage for the Goliath it's become. Netflix's first CEO, Marc Randolph, related one such story in a recently published Wall Street Journal piece : In Amazon's early days, Jeff Bezos used a recycled door as a desk.

In 2019, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is a billionaire many, many times over. And Amazon? It's one of the biggest companies in the world, of course. But way back in the summer of 1998, Bezos' Amazon was still a fledgling startup — and Bezos was using a recycled door as a desk. It wasn't just Bezos who was using the makeshift desk, though. ""His desk, and the desks of the two other people he shared the office with, were made of doors mounted atop 4 × 4 wooden legs, braced with triangular metal pieces,"" Netflix's first CEO Marc Randolph writes in a newly published Wall Street Journal story . ""I suddenly realized that every desk I'd seen in that office was the same.""

The social media conversation framed CVS as a massive corporation bent on obstructing women's access to contraception.

Lying down is great and all, but when you're at the dinner table, around the campfire, relaxing in the backyard, or tailgating before the game, sitting is the preferable position.

Cash-back cards are the most popular rewards credit cards, according to a recent study. While it's possible to get more value from travel rewards cards , cash back is simpler, more flexible, and often easier. Like most rewards credit cards , cash-back cards work by giving you a portion of the processing fee that the issuer gets from the merchant for each transaction. While some cards offer a consistent 1.5–2% cash-back rate on purchases, you may be better off with a card that offers higher amounts back in bonus categories, or large new membership bonuses. Similarly, you might actually earn more from a card with an annual fee than a no-annual-fee option. These are the best cash back credit cards currently available, from Chase, Citi, Wells Fargo, Capital One, and American Express. When you're looking to earn credit card rewards, the type of rewards you go for, beyond just the specific card you open, can make a big difference in how much value you get.",HD,en,Business Insider

We've rounded up seven products that add a powerful punch of style to your personal refuge, and each one costs less than $100. Far too many people retire to bleak, cluttered, or just plain ugly sleeping chambers each night.

The two are often compared to see which is the better go-to home-improvement retailer. Business Insider wrote in a 2018 review that Home Depot had much more to offer than Lowe's , and it was more popular among millennials who named it their home-improvement store of choice, according to a Bank of America survey. But while Walmart is in no way as specialized in home improvement as Lowe's or Home Depot, we wondered which retailer was the best option for the everyday shopper in search of some essential home-improvement items. We visited all three stores to see what each offers overall in home improvement and to see how easy it was to locate three standard items : a hammer, a tape measure, and a box of nails. Home Depot stuck out for its wide selection in various departments, Lowe's for its overall displays and branding, and Walmart for being the perfect place for the average shopper.",HD,en,Business Insider
