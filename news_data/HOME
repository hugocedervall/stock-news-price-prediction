Albañiles, encofradores, operarios en fachada… son hoy en día perfiles que se rifan las empresas constructoras. Si el estallido de la burbuja inmobiliaria expulsó a más de un millón de profesionales del ladrillo, la situación que vive ahora el mercado es bien distinta. La recuperación iniciada en 2014 hizo que se cambiaran las tornas y las profesiones relegadas al olvido hace una década vuelven a experimentar una alta demanda por parte de las compañías, que necesitan con urgencia mano de obra cualificada para las nuevas promociones de vivienda. Electricistas, carpinteros, soldadores, albañiles, yeseros y fontaneros son algunos de los oficios manuales cualificados más buscados por los empresarios, tanto en España como a nivel mundial, según revela el estudio «Escasez de Talento: qué quieren los profesionales», elaborado por ManpowerGroup. Una de las razones que explican el déficit de candidatos es la falta de relevo generacional, ya que los oficiales que tenían cierta edad se jubilaron durante la crisis y las nuevas generaciones no han tomado el testigo. «Los padres prefieren que sus hijos sean universitarios a que tengan habilidades manuales.",HOME,es,ABC

Sus efectos sobre la salud financiera de particulares y empresas comenzaron a notarse a partir de 2008, año en que los deudores concursados se dispararon un 188% respecto al ejercicio anterior, al pasar de los 1.147 a los 3.298, según la Estadística de Procedimiento Concursal del INE. En 2009 continuó la tendencia alcista de las insolvencias, hasta llegar a los 6.197 afectados.

La construcción acabó 2019 en recesión, es decir, registrando dos trimestres consecutivos de destrucción de la actividad. Así lo reflejan los datos de contabilidad nacional, que recogen que el PIB del sector cayó en el tercer trimestre un 0,39%, un descenso que se agudizó en el cuarto al 1,72%, en cifras ajustadas de calendario y estacionalidad. El INE aún debe confirmar el dato de avance que publicó hace una semana, pero este recoge que en términos anuales del cuarto trimestre de 2018 al de 2019 la construcción se contrajo un 0,65%.
